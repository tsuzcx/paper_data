Due to the most cost-effective way for two-way communication, the use of power line distribution grid for data communication of smart meters has gained higher interests by utility companies. This paper presents the smart grid system with power line communication (PLC). The system serves as the communication infrastructure linking smart meters through the PLC network. The characteristics of PLC multipath channel and the noise model are presented. The smart meters and PLC are modeled based on the actual distribution grid data to set the model for analyzing the feasibility and performance of a smart grid. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique is used to improve better performance and higher efficiency. Simulation results on different loading conditions have confirmed the performance of OFDM when operating in a power line channel in smart grid system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012258/6019935/06020014.pdf","startPage":"2239","endPage":"2244","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2011.6020014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2011.6020014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of power line communication with OFDM to smart grid system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Smart grids","Signal to noise ratio","Transfer functions","Modulation","Loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","OFDM modulation","power distribution","power meters","smart power grids","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power line communication","OFDM","smart grid system","power distribution grid","energy generation","power line distribution grid","data communication","PLC multipath channel","smart meters","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise","Power line communication","Multipath channel","OFDM","Smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of power line communication with OFDM to smart grid system","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6020014/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12244570","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of power line communication with OFDM to smart grid system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055602S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012258","isNumber":"6019935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012258","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6019935","articleId":"6020014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6020035,"authors":[{"name":"Yeong-Chau Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.

In the other hand, thanks to the possibility offered by FPGAs to design efficient dedicated architectures, a very important reduction of execution time is performed and only few microseconds are needed for the execution time. Experimental results carried on a FPGA based prototyping platform are given in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the implemented sliding mode DPC of three-phase PWM boost rectifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020167.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based sliding mode direct power control of three-phase PWM boost rectifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Rectifiers","Pulse width modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Power control","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power control","PWM power convertors","rectifiers","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase PWM boost rectifier","direct power control","field programmable gate array","FPGA","sliding mode theory","external disturbances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Three-phase PWM boost rectifier","DPC","sliding mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based sliding mode direct power control of three-phase PWM boost rectifier","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12267842","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based sliding mode direct power control of three-phase PWM boost rectifier","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0116epe2011full09183614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055748S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6020167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6020223,"authors":[{"name":"Chuanhong Zhao","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Chuanhong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38468260500"},{"name":"Silvia Lewdeni-Schmid","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Ltd, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Lewdeni-Schmid","id":"38468156700"},{"name":"Juergen K.

Extensive studies are known on elimination, minimization, and compensation of the effect. Most techniques achieve a reduction of the distortion but are not capable of completely removing it. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to fully eliminate dead-time effects by applying the so-called opposed current converter topology in combination with decoupled output and bias current control. The bias current guarantees continuous conduction mode, resulting in almost linear behavior and no zero crossing distortion. The zero-crossing behavior of the opposed current converter is compared to a conventional full-bridge converter with equivalently filtered output. Simulations and measurements on a full-bridge and an opposed current converter of 1.5 kW are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ideas for high-precision applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and

The design and analysis of these systems require proper system modeling. Computational and sampling delays are most important in this context. Three widely used PWM and sampling concepts are considered: single-update PWM with sampling at the start of the switching period, single-update PWM with sampling in the middle of the switching period, and double-update PWM with updating and sampling twice per switching period. For each, the resulting delay is accurately modeled. Moreover, this paper presents a design method, in all three cases, of a PI-based current-control using discrete-time analysis. The derived models are analyzed by root-locus and step response analysis and thoroughly verified by measurements. Additionally, the impact of updating and sampling strategy on an LCL filter system with different characteristic resonance frequencies is analyzed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020301/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12267976","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Models and effects of different updating and sampling concepts to the control of grid-connected PWM converters \u2014 A study based on discrete time domain analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models and effects of different updating and sampling concepts to the control of grid-connected PWM converters \u2014 A study based on discrete time domain analysis","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0338epe2011full10193288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052097S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":6020314,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Hanashima","affiliation":["TOKYO DENKI UNIVERSITY, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Hanashima","id":"38467736000"},{"name":"Tomoki Yokoyama","affiliation":["TOKYO DENKI UNIVERSITY, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37275594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-14-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-167-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-15-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6020314","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Impedance","Accuracy","Voltage control","Pulse width modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","digital control","feedback","field programmable gate arrays","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disturbance compensation method","single phase utility interactive inverter","FPGA","hardware controller","deadbeat control","utility grid variations","LC filter components","real time digital feedback control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Utility Interactive Inverter","Deadbeat Control","Disturbance compensation"]}],"abstract":"A new deadbeat control with disturbance compensation method for FPGA based hardware controller for utility interactive inverter system is proposed to enhance the robustness for utility grid variations with small LC filter components.

The emerging Modular Multilevel Converter (M2C) technology offers the possibility to make such power conversion in one step using Modular Multilevel Frequency Converters (MMFC) with full-bridge sub-modules. A detailed study of the modulation and control of such converters is presented in this paper. The voltage inserted by each arm of the MMFC is a mixture of the three-phase 50 Hz voltage and the single phase 16.7 Hz voltage. It is important that the voltage reference given to the modulator will be carefully reproduced by the converter because any deviation can introduce undesired frequency components from the single-phase side to the three-phase side and vice versa. The fact that the low frequency, single-phase load causes low-frequency ripple in the total capacitor voltage complicates the problem to generate the correct modulation pattern. In this paper it is proposed to solve that difficulty by estimating the instaneous total capacitor voltages in each arm and provide that information to the modulator. It is shown that such estimations can be performed using measured currents on the single- and three-phase sides. Stable single-phase voltage, symmetrical undistorted three-phase currents and stable converter capacitor voltages are achieved under varying loading conditions. Models in Matlab/Simulink (continuous) and EMTDC/PSCAD (discrete sub-modules) have been developed in this study.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-loop approach to control a Modular Multilevel Frequency Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Open-loop approach to control a Modular Multilevel Frequency Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020336/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020336/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-loop approach to control a Modular Multilevel Frequency Converter","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0400epe2011full17574634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05458S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6020341,"authors":[{"name":"Bjarte Hoff","affiliation":["Narvik University College, Narvik, Norway"],"firstName":"Bjarte","lastName":"Hoff","id":"37948197600"},{"name":"Waldemar Sulkowski","affiliation":["Narvik University College, Narvik, Norway"],"firstName":"Waldemar","lastName":"Sulkowski","id":"37296707300"},{"name":"Trond \u00d8strem","affiliation":["Narvik University College, Narvik, Norway"],"firstName":"Trond","lastName":"\u00d8strem","id":"37296705700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-14-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-167-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-15-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6020341","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","least squares approximations","recursive estimation","state-space methods","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online STATCOM load estimation","inverter synchronized sampler","recursive least-squares","state-space model","power system","static synchronous compensator","distributed energy sources","measurement noise","control design","smart grid applications","one step predictor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation technique","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Voltage Source Inverters (VSI)","Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020341","abstract":"In this paper, a state-space model of the power system is estimated as seen from the inverter using recursive least-squares (RLS).

Besides the traditional requirements of high efficiency, low EMI noise and dimming capability, there are two important requirements. Those are the array light level evenness and the quality of the lamp current waveform. The former is critical especially for very large screen display where CCFL are still attractive. And the latter affects the lifespan of the lamps if the harmonic content of the lamp current is high. Both of these performances are affected by the parasitic elements of both the lamp and the balancing chokes. The issue has never been tackled from an overall point of view. In this paper, theoretical model will be developed and design procedure proposed to determine the critical design parameters. Experiments based on a laboratory 200W prototype were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed circuit model. Although CCFL lamp was used for illustration and experimentation in this paper, the results of this paper are applicable to other lamp that use resonant circuit and inductor balancing chokes in the ballast circuit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020429/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268104","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design approach for the cold cathode fluorescent lamps backlight inverters with lamp current balancing chokes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design approach for the cold cathode fluorescent lamps backlight inverters with lamp current balancing chokes","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0686epe2011full23041847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038964S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6020440,"authors":[{"name":"I.

X-dim SMT components that have uniform height and enhanced thermal properties are stacked between planar substrates to achieve high power density and better thermal performance of industrial drive. The use of wide band gap SiC semiconductors results in an industrial drive efficiency increase of around 3% compared to that of Si-based counterpart. It is found that the parasitic coupling between SiC semiconductors and heat sinks significantly deteriorates the JFET's switching performance. The thermal management concept for industrial drive, in which two separate heat sinks minimises the capacitive coupling effect thus exploiting the full potential of fast SiC JFETs is proposed. The layered 3-D construction and lower power loss enabled by SiC semiconductors allows for reduced thermal management effort and consequently increased power density. The 2.2kW SiC-based industrial drive has the power density of 3.8kW/l, system efficiency of 98.4% and operates at the temperatures below 50\u00b0C without typical heavy and/or complex heat sinks.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Sandwich industrial drive with SiC JFETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020440/","displayDocTitle":"Power Sandwich industrial drive with SiC JFETs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268115","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020440/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Sandwich industrial drive with SiC JFETs","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0709epe2011full19030663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050123S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6020450,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The main objective of this work is to build an accurate nonlinear transient finite element method (FEM) model coupling to circuit model and validate this experimentally. The FEM model is made by scripts, so it is very convenient to change design parameters of PM machine. This will help in design optimization of PM machines. A sample PM machine is investigated for validating no-load voltage, load voltage, electric current, electromagnetic torque, short circuit current and reactance of FEM model. Comparison of simulation and experimental results shows very good agreement with error margin smaller than 3%. Results show that the end effects of a PM machine with concentrated windings having large number of teeth and poles can be neglected, even when its diameter is larger than its length. Analysis of results during three-phase short circuit shows that armature current during short circuit is limited strongly by armature reaction in the d-axis direction, even though the winding resistance is much smaller than the reactance. It can be shown that a PM machine designed with reasonable reactance can avoid demagnetization due to three-phase short circuit.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020450.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of non-linear dynamic FEM model for design of PM machines with concentrated windings in ship application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Validation of non-linear dynamic FEM model for design of PM machines with concentrated windings in ship application","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020450/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268125","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020450/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of non-linear dynamic FEM model for design of PM machines with concentrated windings in ship application","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0728epe2011full11553900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065037S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6020451,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Alvarez","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Alvarez","id":"37410729000"},{"name":"Felipe Filsecker","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Filsecker","id":"38480614300"},{"name":"Steffen Bernet","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Bernet","id":"37266741100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-14-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-167-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-15-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6020451","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":555},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Switches","Semiconductor diodes","Stress","Switching loss","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamps","losses","power semiconductor switches","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IGCT","hard switching","industrial application","clamp operation","switching losses","press pack IGBT devices","medium voltage converters","size 85 mm","voltage 4.5 kV","current 1.2 kA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IGBT","Device characterization","Test bench","Packaging","Device application","Industrial application"]}],"abstract":"The newly developed press-pack IGBT devices compete with IGCTs in high power industrial applications.

The results, verified using MATLAB-Simulink, indicate that the circuit can outperform other proposed balancing circuits, halve the DC-link capacitance and cover cases where the switching frequency cannot be increased.","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020471.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit for reducing devices voltage stress due to DC-link capacitor voltage ripple in a Neutral-Point-Clamped inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Circuit for reducing devices voltage stress due to DC-link capacitor voltage ripple in a Neutral-Point-Clamped inverter","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020471/","accessionNumber":"12268146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020471/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit for reducing devices voltage stress due to DC-link capacitor voltage ripple in a Neutral-Point-Clamped inverter","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0530epe2011full14555303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080554S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6020479,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Kenzelmann","affiliation":["Ecole Polyt\u00e9chnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratoire d'\u00e9lectronique industrielle, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Kenzelmann","id":"37546769300"},{"name":"Alfred Rufer","affiliation":["Ecole Polyt\u00e9chnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratoire d'\u00e9lectronique industrielle, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Rufer","id":"37271772900"},{"name":"Michail Vasiladiotis","affiliation":["Ecole Polyt\u00e9chnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratoire d'\u00e9lectronique industrielle, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Vasiladiotis","id":"37541548200"},{"name":"Drazen Dujic","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Corporate Research, CH-RD.S1 - Power Electronic Systems Group, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Drazen","lastName":"Dujic","id":"37395235800"},{"name":"Francisco Canales","affiliation":["ABB Switzerland Corporate Research, CH-RD.S1 - Power Electronic Systems Group, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Canales","id":"37282382700"},{"name":"Yales R. de Novaes","affiliation":["NPEE-DEE-CCT-UDESC, Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina, Brasil"],"firstName":"Yales R.","lastName":"de Novaes","id":"37392184400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-14-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-167-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-15-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6020479","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1834},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020479","abstract":"The drawbacks of conventional Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC) are described in terms of short-circuits.

It consists of double layer capacitors and a dc-dc converter. In case of regenerative braking operation the capacitors have to be able to accept energy, in case of acceleration they have to deliver energy. To ensure availability of the system anytime, the ultracapacitors state of charge has to be kept in a predefined range. Therefore a powermanagement has to be set up. The goal of the powermanagement is the intelligent power distribution between battery and super capacitors to reduce as well the maximum as the average battery power. In this paper, the design of a powermanagement is presented. Here, the design is exemplarily presented for an electric lift truck, but it can also be adapted for road vehicles. First, a common fuzzy controller to be applied in the powermanagement is derived. Accordingly, the fuzzy parameters are tuned by means of a genetic algorithm. This paper shows that a powermanagement by means of a fuzzy controller can be used to define a reasonable energy flow in a dual source electric vehicle autonomously. Furthermore it is shown that the success of the system can be strictly dependent on the genetic algorithm optimization method. Methods by means of predefined-base- and a stand-alone-genetic optimization are analyzed as well as the success for membership function tuning, fuzzy rule tuning and for a combined tuning in each case. The powermanagement is finally tested in a lift truck propulsion system test bench.","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020503.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a powermanagement for a battery buffer system in an electric lift truck by means of fuzzy control and genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Genetic algorithms","Genomics","Propulsion","Vehicles","Niobium","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","DC-DC power convertors","electric vehicles","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","power system control","regenerative braking","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management","battery buffer system","electric lift truck","battery lifetime","electric vehicles","double layer capacitors","dc-dc converter","regenerative braking operation","ultracapacitors","intelligent power distribution","super capacitors","road vehicles","common fuzzy controller","fuzzy parameters","dual source electric vehicle","genetic algorithm optimization method","membership function tuning","fuzzy rule tuning","lift truck propulsion system test bench"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric vehicle","Ultra capacitors","Power converters for EV","Power management","Fuzzy control","Energy storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design of a powermanagement for a battery buffer system in an electric lift truck by means of fuzzy control and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268178","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a powermanagement for a battery buffer system in an electric lift truck by means of fuzzy control and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0578epe2011full10432433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070984S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6020513,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK, Kgs.

Due to limitations in AC power transmission the most likable choice for such a grid is a high voltage DC (HVDC) grid. However, the concept of the HVDC grid is still under active development as different technical challenges exist, and it is not yet possible to construct such a DC grid. This paper deals with prospects and technical challenges for the future HVDC SuperGrids. Different topologies for a SuperGrid and the possibility to use modular multilevel converters (M2Cs) are presented. A comprehensive overview of different sub-module implementations of M2C is given. An overview of short circuit behaviour of the M2C is also given, as well as a discussion on the choice between cables or overhead lines and DC-side resonance issues.","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020537.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prospects and challenges of future HVDC SuperGrids with modular multilevel converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","displayDocTitle":"Prospects and challenges of future HVDC SuperGrids with modular multilevel converters","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020537/","accessionNumber":"12268212","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020537/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prospects and challenges of future HVDC SuperGrids with modular multilevel converters","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0638epe2011full16371053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051331S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6020564,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan P.

By a proper control algorithm the proposed converter is able to generate multi-level voltage waveforms, equivalent to the ones of a 3-level inverter, and to share the total motor power among the four dc sources within each switching period.

It is shown that the sum capacitor voltage in each arm often can be considered instead of the individual capacitor voltages, thereby significantly reducing the complexity of the system model. A selection of the so-called insertion indices, which compensates for the sum-capacitor-voltage ripples, is considered. The system which results for this selection is analyzed, and is shown to be asymptotically stable.

The operation of the converter was described, including the method of maintaining the charge in the individual submodules equal within a link, but did not consider the method of maintaining the net charge of the links. This paper presents a method of equalising the net link charge by circulating DC current within the converter over a series of successive steps. A set of simultaneous expressions are derived presenting a \u201ccost function\u201d for each of the possible solutions considered and showing the comparative affect each solution will have on the overall variation from the ideal set point. A selection is made at each sample point of the best current path, its magnitude and polarity. The MATLAB model described in the original paper has been adapted to show the operation of the algorithm and its operation, this being demonstrated by varying the submodule capacitance across the converter. Further work required is to explore the stability of the algorithm for a wide range of conditions ranging from the presence of non-positive sequence being present on the AC supplies to the occurrence of phase faults.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 14th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6014782/6020091/06020667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020091","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC circulating current for capacitor voltage balancing in modular multilevel matrix converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DC circulating current for capacitor voltage balancing in modular multilevel matrix converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020667/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12268342","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC circulating current for capacitor voltage balancing in modular multilevel matrix converter","confLoc":"Birmingham, UK","sourcePdf":"0953epe2011full13163933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036976S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6014782","isNumber":"6020091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6014782","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6020091","articleId":"6020667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6020674,"authors":[{"name":"Hans-Joachim Knaak","affiliation":["SIEMENS AG, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Joachim","lastName":"Knaak","id":"37085480433"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-14-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-167-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-90-75815-15-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6020674","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2784},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Power harmonic filters","Static VAr compensators","Voltage control","Capacitors","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Wind farms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","power cables","power transmission reliability","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel converters","HVDC-FACTS","Trans Bay Cable project","electrical power","Pittsburg","CA","San Francisco","subsea cable","thyristor-based HVDC plants","Siemens","HVDC PLUS contracts","static VAR compensators","SVC","transmission grids","renewable energy sources","power transmission capability","power 400 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HVDC","FACTS","Multilevel converters","Voltage Source Converter (VSC)","Power transmission"]}],"abstract":"The first modular multilevel converter for HVDC application went operational in 2010.

A DE algorithm is employed as an acceleration operation to accelerate the convergence of the approach in case that the optimal result has no significant improvements after several iterations. A migration operation is adopted to keep the swarm's crowding diversity above a desired level. In addition, a special repair procedure, instead of the penalty function approach, is applied to handle the complex equality constraints of STHS. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through three hydrothermal test systems published in literature. The results are also compared with those obtained by other evolutionary methods. The fuel cost as well as other performance of the proposed approach has been found to be quite impressive.

Most computational models of the peripheral auditory system include a sigmoidal nonlinear function that relates the log of signal intensity to output level, which we represent by a set of frequency dependent logistic functions. The parameters of these rate-level functions are estimated to maximize the a posteriori probability of the correct class in training data. The performance of this approach was verified by the results of a series of experiments conducted with the CMU S phinx-III speech recognition system on the DARPA Resource Management, Wall Street Journal databases, and on the AURORA 2 database. In general, it was shown that feature extraction that incorporates the learned rate-nonlinearity, combined with a complementary loudness compensation function, results in better recognition accuracy in the presence of background noise than traditional MFCC feature extraction without the optimized nonlinearity when the system is trained on clean speech and tested in noise. We also describe the use of lattice structure that constraints the training process, enabling training with much more complicated acoustic models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12470261","htmlLink":"/document/6020747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning-Based Auditory Encoding for Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Based Auditory Encoding for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-chiu-2168209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073449S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6020747","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020748,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Adler","affiliation":["The Computer Science Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6125258/6020748/6020748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Adler (S'10) received the B.Sc.

In this framework, the distorted data are treated as missing and their location is assumed to be known. The signal is decomposed into overlapping time-domain frames and the restoration problem is then formulated as an inverse problem per audio frame. Sparse representation modeling is employed per frame, and each inverse problem is solved using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm together with a discrete cosine or a Gabor dictionary. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio performance of this algorithm is shown to be comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods when blocks of samples of variable durations are missing. We also demonstrate that the size of the block of missing samples, rather than the overall number of missing samples, is a crucial parameter for high quality signal restoration. We further introduce a constrained Matching Pursuit approach for the special case of audio declipping that exploits the sign pattern of clipped audio samples and their maximal absolute value, as well as allowing the user to specify the maximum amplitude of the signal. This approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art and commercially available methods for audio declipping in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2168211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2168211","startPage":"922","endPage":"932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6125258/06020748.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio Inpainting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Audio Inpainting","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12470262","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6020748/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio Inpainting","sourcePdf":"tasl-emiya-2168211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112194S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6020748","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6020752,"authors":[{"name":"YingLiang Ma","affiliation":["TheDivision of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, The Rayne Institute, Saint Thomas Hospital, London, UK"],"firstName":"YingLiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37400259500"},{"name":"Andy P.

X-ray images have poor soft tissue contrast and, for this reason, overlay of static 3-D roadmaps derived from preprocedural volumetric data can be used to add anatomical information. However, the registration between the 3-D roadmap and the 2-D X-ray image can be compromised by patient respiratory motion. Three methods were designed and evaluated to correct for respiratory motion using features in the 2-D X-ray images. The first method is based on tracking either the diaphragm or the heart border using the image intensity in a region of interest. The second method detects the tracheal bifurcation using the generalized Hough transform and a 3-D model derived from 3-D preoperative volumetric data. The third method is based on tracking the coronary sinus (CS) catheter. This method uses blob detection to find all possible catheter electrodes in the X-ray image. A cost function is applied to select one CS catheter from all catheter-like objects. All three methods were applied to X-ray images from 18 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The 2-D target registration errors (TRE) at the pulmonary veins were calculated to validate the methods. A TRE of 1.6 mm \u00b1 0.8 mm was achieved for the diaphragm tracking; 1.7 mm \u00b1 0.9 mm for heart border tracking, 1.9 mm \u00b1 1.0 mm for trachea tracking, and 1.8 mm \u00b1 0.9 mm for CS catheter tracking. We present a comprehensive comparison between the techniques in terms of robustness, as computed by tracking errors, and accuracy, as computed by TRE using two independent approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2168393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6106028/06020752.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2168393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6106028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clinical Evaluation of Respiratory Motion Compensation for Anatomical Roadmap Guided Cardiac Electrophysiology Procedures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020752/","displayDocTitle":"Clinical Evaluation of Respiratory Motion Compensation for Anatomical Roadmap Guided Cardiac Electrophysiology Procedures","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425363","pubMedId":"21926014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020752/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clinical Evaluation of Respiratory Motion Compensation for Anatomical Roadmap Guided Cardiac Electrophysiology Procedures","sourcePdf":"tbme-ma-2168393-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111936S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6106028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6106028","articleId":"6020752","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020756,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6041055/6020756/6020756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Young Choi (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2007.

To reduce PDN impedance, one can place decoupling capacitors that act as local current sources. However, selecting and placing the right capacitors at the right locations are problematic because of the complexity of modern package and board structures. In addition, decoupling capacitors are not effective at higher frequencies, requiring more complicated techniques such as embedded decoupling. This paper introduces a method of reducing the effort expended by the complex task of decoupling capacitor placement: a genetic algorithm that is customized for the selection and placement of decoupling capacitors. The core engine of this optimizing algorithm is a recently developed technique, the multilayer finite element method (MFEM), which solves for PDN impedances. This paper also highlights a method of incorporating vertical circuit elements into MFEM. Using several test cases, it proves the validity of the inclusion of vertical elements in MFEM and the effectiveness of the optimizer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling Capacitor Placement in Power Delivery Networks Using MFEM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2165954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6041055/06020756.pdf","startPage":"1651","endPage":"1661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2165954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Decoupling Capacitor Placement in Power Delivery Networks Using MFEM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6020756/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288133","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupling Capacitor Placement in Power Delivery Networks Using MFEM","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-choi-2165954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054619S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6041055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6041055","articleId":"6020756","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6020757,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Geol Lee","affiliation":["School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6041055/6020757/6020757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Geol Lee received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) from Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea, in 2004, the M.S. degree from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2011.","He joined the Computational NanoBio Technology Laboratory, School of Materials and Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, in August 2007.

The thermal expansion of the hydrated model EMC was evaluated as 1-5% of its dried volume with increasing temperature. The spatial distributions of the amine groups and hydroxyl groups are not significantly affected by temperature due to the crosslinked topological constraint. The correlation of these functional groups with water molecules was not affected by temperature due to their hydrophilicity. In contrast, it is observed that the water phase is expanded with increasing temperature, which is more distinct as a function of water content. The temperature effect on the water diffusion was clearly observed: the diffusion coefficient became larger with increasing temperature. The activation energy for the water diffusion via a hopping mechanism was 21.9 kJ/mol (0.23 eV) and 21.2 kJ/mol (0.22 eV) for the 4 wt% and the 7 wt% water contents, respectively, which infers that the water transport is more facilitated with increasing water content because the water structure of the water phase in the model EMC is more developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6041055/06020757.pdf","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2160343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2160343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Temperature on Water Molecules in a Model Epoxy Molding Compound: Molecular Dynamics Simulation Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic compatibility","Temperature distribution","Solid modeling","Moisture","Correlation","Polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffusion","hydrophilicity","molecular dynamics method","organic compounds","thermal expansion","water"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water molecules","epoxy molding compound","atomistic molecular dynamics simulation","thermal expansion","spatial distributions","hydroxyl groups","amine groups","crosslinked topological constraint","hydrophilicity","diffusion coefficient","activation energy","hopping mechanism","water transport","temperature 298 K to 373 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diffusion","epoxy","epoxy molding compound","molecular dynamics","packaging","simulation","water absorption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Temperature on Water Molecules in a Model Epoxy Molding Compound: Molecular Dynamics Simulation Approach","volume":"1","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6020757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288134","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Temperature on Water Molecules in a Model Epoxy Molding Compound: Molecular Dynamics Simulation Approach","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-jang-2160343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093683S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6041055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6041055","articleId":"6020757","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020761,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Ndip","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration (IZM) Berlin, Berlin, Germany","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Technical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6041055/6020761/6020761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ivan Ndip (M'05) received the M.Sc.

The frequency ranges of these modes and their transitions are predicted using resistivity-frequency domain charts. The impact of the modes on signal integrity is quantified, and three coaxial TSV configurations are proposed to minimize this impact. Finally, conventional expressions for calculating the per-unit-length circuit parameters of transmission lines are extended and used to analytically capture the frequency dependent behavior of TSVs, considering the impact of the mixed dielectric (silicon dioxide-silicon-silicon dioxide) around the TSVs. Excellent correlation is obtained between the analytical calculations using the extended expressions and electromagnetic field simulations up to 130 GHz. These extended expressions can be implemented directly in electronic design automation tools to facilitate performance evaluation of TSVs, prior to system design.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2164915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6041055/06020761.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2164915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041055","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Modeling of TSVs for 3-D Chip Integration and Silicon Interposers Considering Skin-Effect, Dielectric Quasi-TEM and Slow-Wave Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Modeling of TSVs for 3-D Chip Integration and Silicon Interposers Considering Skin-Effect, Dielectric Quasi-TEM and Slow-Wave Modes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288138","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020761/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Modeling of TSVs for 3-D Chip Integration and Silicon Interposers Considering Skin-Effect, Dielectric Quasi-TEM and Slow-Wave Modes","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-ndip-2164915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200991S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6041055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6041055","articleId":"6020761","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020765,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Matsubara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Matsubara","id":"37274080000"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Torikai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Torikai","id":"37269370000"},{"name":"Tetsuya Hishiki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Hishiki","id":"37847110600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6020765","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":850},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"A generalized rotate-and-fire digital spiking neuron model that can be implemented by a simple asynchronous sequential logic circuit is proposed.

It is difficult to parallelize the sparse matrix solver because of the high data dependence during the numerical LU factorization. In this brief, a parallel LU factorization algorithm is developed on shared-memory computers with multicore central processing units, based on KLU algorithms. An Elimination Scheduler (EScheduler) is proposed to represent the data dependence during the LU factorization. Based on the EScheduler, the parallel tasks are scheduled in two modes to achieve a high level of concurrence, i.e., cluster mode and pipeline mode . The experimental results on 26 circuit matrices reveal that the developed algorithm can achieve speedup of 1.18-4.55\u00d7 (on geometric average), as compared with KLU, with 1-8 threads. The result analysis indicates that for different data dependence, different parallel strategies should be dynamically selected to obtain optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2164148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2164148","endPage":"706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6045691/06020766.pdf","startPage":"702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EScheduler-Based Data Dependence Analysis and Task Scheduling for Parallel Circuit Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020766/","displayDocTitle":"An EScheduler-Based Data Dependence Analysis and Task Scheduling for Parallel Circuit Simulation","volume":"58","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12300815","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020766/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EScheduler-Based Data Dependence Analysis and Task Scheduling for Parallel Circuit Simulation","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2164148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081375S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6045691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6045691","articleId":"6020766","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6020768,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqi Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6020768/6020768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shiqi Wang received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008.

At the frame level, an adaptive Lagrange multiplier selection method is proposed based on a novel reduced-reference statistical SSIM estimation algorithm and a rate model that combines the side information with the entropy of the transformed residuals. At the macroblock level, the Lagrange multiplier is further adjusted based on an information theoretical approach that takes into account both the motion information content and perceptual uncertainty of visual speed perception. Finally, the mode for H.264/AVC coding is selected by the SSIM index and the adjusted Lagrange multiplier. Extensive experiments show that the proposed scheme can achieve significantly better rate-SSIM performance and provide better visual quality than conventional RDO coding schemes.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6177735/06020768.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSIM-Motivated Rate-Distortion Optimization for Video Coding","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2168269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2168269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"SSIM-Motivated Rate-Distortion Optimization for Video Coding","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638843","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6020768/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSIM-Motivated Rate-Distortion Optimization for Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-wang-2168269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136217S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6177735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6177735","articleId":"6020768","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020769,"authors":[{"name":"Chuohao Yeo","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6177735/6020769/6020769-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuohao Yeo (S'05\u2013M'09) received the S.B. degree in electrical science and engineering and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California (UC) at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 2009.","From 2005 to 2009, he was a Graduate Student Researcher with the Berkeley Audio Visual Signal Processing and Communication Systems Laboratory, UC Berkeley.

Our analysis shows that only one additional transform, the odd type-3 discrete sine transform (ODST-3), is required for the optimal implementation of mode-dependent transforms. In addition, the four-point ODST-3 also has a structure that can be exploited to reduce the operation count of the transform operation.

The results presented show the first through-the-wall (TTW) detections of moving personnel using passive WiFi radar. The measured Doppler shifts agree with those predicted by bistatic theory. Further analysis of the data revealed that the system is limited by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and not the signal-to-noise ratio. We have also shown that a new interference suppression technique based on the CLEAN algorithm can improve the SIR by approximately 19 dB.

The abundance fraction prior is a mixture of Dirichlet densities, thus automatically enforcing the constraints on the abundance fractions imposed by the acquisition process, namely, nonnegativity and sum-to-one. A cyclic minimization algorithm is developed where the following are observed: 1) The number of Dirichlet modes is inferred based on the minimum description length principle; 2) a generalized expectation maximization algorithm is derived to infer the model parameters; and 3) a sequence of augmented Lagrangian-based optimizations is used to compute the signatures of the endmembers.

However, the Automated Cloud-Cover Assessment (CCA) (ACCA) algorithm used on Landsat 7 requires a thermal band and is thus not suited for OLI. There will be a thermal instrument on the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM)-the Thermal Infrared Sensor-which may not be available during all OLI collections. This illustrates a need for CCA for LDCM in the absence of thermal data. To research possibilities for full-resolution OLI cloud assessment, a global data set of 207 Landsat 7 scenes with manually generated cloud masks was created. It was used to evaluate the ACCA algorithm, showing that the algorithm correctly classified 79.9% of a standard test subset of 3.95 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup>\n pixels. The data set was also used to develop and validate two successor algorithms for use with OLI data-one derived from an off-the-shelf machine learning package and one based on ACCA but enhanced by a simple neural network. These comprehensive CCA algorithms were shown to correctly classify pixels as cloudy or clear 88.5% and 89.7% of the time, respectively.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6172975/06020782.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1154","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6172975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission Cloud-Cover Assessment Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Development of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission Cloud-Cover Assessment Algorithms","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638341","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission Cloud-Cover Assessment Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tgrs-scaramuzza-2164087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046886S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6172975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"54","articleId":"6020782","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6020783,"authors":[{"name":"Arie Sheinker","affiliation":["SOREQ Nuclear Research Center, Yavne, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6172975/6020783/6020783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arie Sheinker (M'06) was born in Czernowitz, Ukraine, in 1971.

This algorithm is an extension of the successful Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) segmentation and classification algorithm, which was designed for amplitude only SAR imagery, to polarimetric data. Polarimetric IRGS (PolarIRGS) extends IRGS by incorporating a polarimetric feature model based on the Wishart distribution and modifying key steps such as initialization, edge strength computation, and the region growing criterion. Like IRGS, PolarIRGS oversegments an image into regions and employs iterative region growing to reduce the size of the solution search space. The incorporation of an edge penalty in the spatial context model improves segmentation performance by preserving segment boundaries that traditional spatial models will smooth over. Evaluation of PolarIRGS with Flevoland fully polarimetric data shows that it improves upon two other recently published techniques in terms of classification accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6172975/06020785.pdf","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6172975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Polarimetric SAR Image Segmentation and Classification Using Region Growing With Edge Penalty","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Context modeling","Context","Image edge detection","Merging","Covariance matrix","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image segmentation","iterative methods","Markov processes","radar imaging","radar polarimetry","random processes","search problems","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised polarimetric SAR image segmentation","image classification","edge penalty","region-based unsupervised segmentation","classification algorithm","polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery","Markov random field edge strength model","iterative region growing with semantics segmentation","IRGS segmentation","amplitude only SAR imagery","polarimetric IRGS","PolarIRGS","polarimetric feature model","Wishart distribution","edge strength computation","region growing criterion","search space","spatial context model","segmentation performance","segment boundary","Flevoland fully polarimetric data","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex","image segmentation","Markov random field (MRF)","polarimetry","region adjacency graph (RAG)","region-based","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Wishart"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Polarimetric SAR Image Segmentation and Classification Using Region Growing With Edge Penalty","volume":"50","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6020785/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638344","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Polarimetric SAR Image Segmentation and Classification Using Region Growing With Edge Penalty","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yu-2164085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160464S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6172975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6172975","articleId":"6020785","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6020786,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Science, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Key Laboratory of Advanced Control for Light Industry Processes, Ministry of Education, Institute of Automation, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China","Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/6020786/6020786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Shi (SM'97) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1982, the M.E. degree in control theory from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, in 1985, the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia, in 1994, the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, in 1998, and the D.Sc. degree from the University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, U.K., in 2006.","He was a Lecturer with Heilongjiang University, Harbin, from 1985 to 1989 and the University of South Australia from 1997 to 1999 and a Senior Scientist with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Department of Defence, Australia, from 1999 to 2005.

However, SPN can be contaminated largely in the frequency domain by image content and nonunique artefacts of JPEG compression, on-sensor signal transfer, sensor design, color interpolation. The source camera identification (CI) performance based on SPN needs to be improved for small sizes of images and especially in resisting JPEG compression. Because the SPN is modelled as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in its extraction process from an image, it is reasonable to assume the camera reference SPN to be a white noise signal in order to remove the interference mentioned above. The noise residues (SPN) extracted from the original images are whitened first, then they are averaged to generate the camera reference SPN. Motivated by Goljan 's test statistic peak to correlation energy (PCE), we propose to use correlation to circular correlation norm (CCN) as the test statistic, which can lower the false positive rate to be a half of that with PCE. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed CI method can remove the interference and raise the CCN value of a positive sample and thus achieve greater CI performance, CCN values of the negative sample class with the proposed method follow the normal distribution \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n (0,1) and the false positive rate can be calculated. Compared with the existing state of the art on seven cameras, 1400 photos totally (200 for each camera), the experimental results show that the proposed CI method achieves the best receiver operating characteristic (ROC) performance among all CI methods in all cases and especially achieves much better resistance to JPEG compression than all of the existing state-of-the-art CI methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2168214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6166811/06020790.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2168214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6166811","startPage":"393","endPage":"402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Source Camera Identification Performance With a Camera Reference Phase Sensor Pattern Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Source Camera Identification Performance With a Camera Reference Phase Sensor Pattern Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578140","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6020790/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Source Camera Identification Performance With a Camera Reference Phase Sensor Pattern Noise","sourcePdf":"tifs-kang-2168214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061898S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6166811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6166811","articleId":"6020790","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020798,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["Image and Video Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6151934/6020798/6020798-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Young Choi received the B.S. degree from Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","In 2008, he was a visiting researcher at the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

The proposed color local texture features are able to exploit the discriminative information derived from spatiochromatic texture patterns of different spectral channels within a certain local face region. Furthermore, in order to maximize a complementary effect taken by using both color and texture information, the opponent color texture features that capture the texture patterns of spatial interactions between spectral channels are also incorporated into the generation of CLGW and CLBP. In addition, to perform the final classification, multiple color local texture features (each corresponding to the associated color band) are combined within a feature-level fusion framework. Extensive and comparative experiments have been conducted to evaluate our color local texture features for FR on five public face databases, i.e., CMU-PIE, Color FERET, XM2VTSDB, SCface, and FRGC 2.0. Experimental results show that FR approaches using color local texture features impressively yield better recognition rates than FR approaches using only color or texture information. Particularly, compared with grayscale texture features, the proposed color local texture features are able to provide excellent recognition rates for face images taken under severe variation in illumination, as well as for small- (low-) resolution face images. In addition, the feasibility of our color local texture features has been successfully demonstrated by making comparisons with other state-of-the-art color FR methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Local Texture Features for Color Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2168413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06020798.pdf","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2168413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Color Local Texture Features for Color Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6020798/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537608","pubMedId":"21926019","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Local Texture Features for Color Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-choi-2168413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095067S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6020798","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020799,"authors":[{"name":"Zachary T.

The method proposed here enables the detection of a much larger range of facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle actions [action units (AUs)] that compound expressions. AUs are agnostic, leaving the inference about conveyed intent to higher order decision making (e.g., emotion recognition). The proposed fully automatic method not only allows the recognition of 22 AUs but also explicitly models their temporal characteristics (i.e., sequences of temporal segments: neutral, onset, apex, and offset). To do so, it uses a facial point detector based on Gabor-feature-based boosted classifiers to automatically localize 20 facial fiducial points. These points are tracked through a sequence of images using a method called particle filtering with factorized likelihoods. To encode AUs and their temporal activation models based on the tracking data, it applies a combination of GentleBoost, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models. We attain an average AU recognition rate of 95.3% when tested on a benchmark set of deliberately displayed facial expressions and 72% when tested on spontaneous expressions.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6129833/06020812.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Automatic Recognition of the Temporal Phases of Facial Actions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fully Automatic Recognition of the Temporal Phases of Facial Actions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6020812/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471825","pubMedId":"21926026","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Automatic Recognition of the Temporal Phases of Facial Actions","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-valstar-2163710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133986S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6129833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"6129833","articleId":"6020812","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6020813,"authors":[{"name":"Hongli Dong","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/6169194/6020813/6020813-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongli Dong (M'11) received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2000 and the M.E. degree in control theory and engineering from Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China, in 2003.

The mixed time delays comprise both the multiple discrete time delays and the infinite distributed delays. A sequence of stochastic variables is introduced to govern the random occurrences of the discrete time delays, distributed time delays, and successive packet dropouts, where all the stochastic variables are mutually independent but obey the Bernoulli distribution. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy fault detection filter such that the overall fault detection dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square and, at the same time, the error between the residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Sufficient conditions are first established via intensive stochastic analysis for the existence of the desired fuzzy fault detection filters, and then, the corresponding solvability conditions for the desired filter gains are established. In addition, the optimal performance index for the addressed robust fuzzy fault detection problem is obtained by solving an auxiliary convex optimization problem. An illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed design method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169194","startPage":"365","endPage":"376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6169194/06020813.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Robust Fault Detection With Stochastic Mixed Time Delays and Successive Packet Dropouts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020813/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Robust Fault Detection With Stochastic Mixed Time Delays and Successive Packet Dropouts","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12592474","pubMedId":"21926025","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-Model-Based Robust Fault Detection With Stochastic Mixed Time Delays and Successive Packet Dropouts","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-wang-2163797-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14118S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6169194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"6169194","articleId":"6020813","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6020814,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Petre Stoica (SM'91\u2013F'94) is currently a Professor of systems modeling in the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden.

As a byproduct, LIMES also provides an estimate of the data covariance matrix that may be of interest in its own right. Spectral estimation from irregularly sampled data is a rather difficult problem and there are only a handful of methods in the literature that can be used for such a task. Of these already existing methods we consider the Daniell method (DAM) for comparison with LIMES. Computationally, LIMES is more complex than DAM. On the other hand, DAM is much less accurate than LIMES in the irregularly sampled data case and for spectra with a relatively large bandwidth. In a nutshell, LIMES should be the method of choice in the unevenly sampled data applications that require high statistical performance and can tolerate an increased computational burden.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06020814.pdf","startPage":"5746","endPage":"5758","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Nonparametric Estimation of Smooth Spectra From Irregularly Sampled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Nonparametric Estimation of Smooth Spectra From Irregularly Sampled Data","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6020814/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358048","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Nonparametric Estimation of Smooth Spectra From Irregularly Sampled Data","sourcePdf":"tsp-babu-2168221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067799S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6020814","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6020816,"authors":[{"name":"Pu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/6020816/6020816-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pu Wang (S\u201905\u2013M\u201911) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.","He was an intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, during summer 2010.

By modeling the disturbance as a multi-channel auto-regressive (AR) process with a random cross-channel (spatial) covariance matrix, two knowledge-aided parametric adaptive detectors are developed within a Bayesian framework. The first knowledge-aided parametric detector is developed using an ad hoc two-step procedure for the estimation of the signal and disturbance parameters, which leads to a successive spatio-temporal whitening process. The second knowledge-aided parametric detector takes a joint approach for the estimation of the signal and disturbance parameters, which leads to a joint spatio-temporal whitening process. Both knowledge-aided parametric detectors are able to utilize prior knowledge about the spatial correlation through colored-loading that combines the sample covariance matrix with a prior covariance matrix. Computer simulation using various data sets, including the KASPPER dataset, show that the knowledge-aided parametric adaptive detectors yield improved detection performance over existing parametric solutions, especially in the case of limited data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Parametric Tests for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06020816.pdf","startPage":"5970","endPage":"5982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-Aided Parametric Tests for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6020816/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-Aided Parametric Tests for Multichannel Adaptive Signal Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2168220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100859S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6020816","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6020818,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitriy Shutin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Shutin","id":"37284490200"},{"name":"Thomas Buchgraber","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Buchgraber","id":"37712670100"},{"name":"Sanjeev R.

The sparse Bayesian modeling, exemplified by the relevance vector machine (RVM), allows a sparse regression or classification function to be constructed as a linear combination of a few basis functions. It is demonstrated that, by computing the stationary points of the variational update expressions with noninformative (ARD) hyperpriors, a fast version of variational SBL can be constructed. Analysis of the computed stationary points indicates that SBL with Gaussian sparsity priors and noninformative hyperpriors corresponds to removing components with signal-to-noise ratio below a 0 dB threshold; this threshold can also be adjusted to significantly improve the convergence rate and sparsity of SBL. It is demonstrated that the pruning conditions derived for fast variational SBL coincide with those obtained for fast marginal likelihood maximization; moreover, the parameters that maximize the variational lower bound also maximize the marginal likelihood function. The effectiveness of fast variational SBL is demonstrated with synthetic as well as with real data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Bayesian methods","Covariance

Numerical simulation shows that, in dealing with noise-free measurements of sparse signals, the relaxed version is accurate, fast and competitive to the recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

A variety of applications, including navigation and intelligent transpiration systems, require position data with certain accuracy. However, the shortcomings of GNSS, such as limited accuracy and availability, have been a motivation for recently emerging Cooperative Positioning (CP) methods based on vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communications. The majority of earlier CP methods assume the availability of distances between the participating nodes as a main parameter, using common techniques of radio ranging such as the Received Signal Strength (RSS), Time of Arrival (TOA), and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). However, the feasibility of these radio-ranging methods in the harsh environment of vehicular networks is questionable. Avoiding the radio-ranging challenges, in this paper, a new CP method is presented to improve the GPS estimates using internode range-rates based on the Doppler shift of the carrier of Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) signals, which is the nominated medium for vehicular communication. Depending on the speed of the participating vehicles and traffic intensity, improvement of up to 48% over the GPS accuracy is achieved. Because the Doppler effect is used, relative mobility of the nodes, which is generally a challenge for radio-ranging techniques, is a requirement for the proposed method, making it a more suitable solution for vehicular applications. Addressing the viability of the proposed technique, Doppler-based range-rating is verified in practice using DSRC transceivers. One section of highway is surveyed and modeled for simulation. In addition, GPS estimates are provided by feeding GPS signals, generated by a GPS signal generator, to a real GPS receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06020821.pdf","startPage":"4462","endPage":"4470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2168249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2168249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DSRC Doppler-Based Cooperative Positioning Enhancement for Vehicular Networks With GPS Availability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Doppler shift","Receivers","Radio transmitters","Distance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","Global Positioning System","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSRC doppler-based cooperative positioning enhancement","vehicular networks","GPS availability","global navigation satellite systems","GNSS","global positioning system","vehicle-based logistic","intelligent transpiration systems","navigation systems","vehicle-infrastructure communications","vehicle-vehicle communications","time of arrival","received signal strength","time difference of arrival","TDOA","dedicated short-range communications","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative positioning (CP)","dedicated short-range communications (DSRC)","Doppler effect","vehicular network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"A DSRC Doppler-Based Cooperative Positioning Enhancement for Vehicular Networks With GPS Availability","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6020821/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408146","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSRC Doppler-Based Cooperative Positioning Enhancement for Vehicular Networks With GPS Availability","sourcePdf":"tvt-alam-2168249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06103S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6020821","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6020828,"authors":[{"name":"X.

One is the sensing or RF Spectrum scanning function and the second is communication or transceiver function. These two functions are performed by a single physical air interface i.e., antenna or antenna arrays and their allied RF circuitry, through interleaving or TDM. This sharing of a single resource between the two essential functions causes interruptions in communication reducing net throughput despite availability of the spectrum holes and bandwidth. The achieved throughput therefore remains much below the theoretically possible throughput. This paper aims at introducing a technique of parallel and independent execution of the two essential functions using two separate dedicated antennas or antenna arrays. The duty cycle of sensing function will be shorter by addition of intelligence or learning added to it thereby economizing on power and other resources. This technique is different from other proposed techniques, available in the literature, suggesting usage of multiple antennas to achieve spatial diversity, temporal diversity or resolution enhancements i.e., all the antennas or the array performing either sensing or communication through interleaving. Simulation of technique presented herein resulted in two fold gains firstly, increased throughput nearing theoretical possible and secondly continuum in operation or communication of CR peers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12243923","htmlLink":"/document/6020933/","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Function specific antennas in cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Function specific antennas in cognitive radios","confLoc":"Abbottabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"a36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108349S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011823","isNumber":"6020883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011823","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6020883","articleId":"6020933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6020934,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Real time transmission such as multimedia transmission plays an important role over cognitive radio networks. Normally a secondary user transmits its video over empty bands. When a primary user wants to switch on its band, the secondary user gets hanged and its transmission stops. To overcome such real time issues an efficient and flexible algorithm (EFMCRN) has been proposed in which image, audio and video signal can be prioritized with respect to processing time and bandwidth utilization. The priority system prioritizes image signal, followed by audio signal and then video signal.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCNIT.2011.6020934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020883","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer Networks and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011823/6020883/06020934.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient & flexible algorithm for multimedia transmission over cognitive radio network (EFMCRN) based on bandwidth utilization and processing time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6020934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6020934/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient & flexible algorithm for multimedia transmission over cognitive radio network (EFMCRN) based on bandwidth utilization and processing time","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12243924","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient & flexible algorithm for multimedia transmission over cognitive radio network (EFMCRN) based on bandwidth utilization and processing time","confLoc":"Abbottabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"a37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057409S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011823","isNumber":"6020883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011823","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6020883","articleId":"6020934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6020944,"authors":[{"name":"Muahmmad Imran","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad"],"firstName":"Muahmmad","lastName":"Imran","id":"37528391600"},{"name":"Zahid Manzoor","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad"],"firstName":"Zahid","lastName":"Manzoor","id":"37086345146"},{"name":"Sajid Ali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, szabist University, Islamabad"],"firstName":"Sajid","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086653622"},{"name":"Qamar Abbas","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Iqra University, Islamabad"],"firstName":"Qamar","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37540529600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-941-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-940-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-939-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2223-6317"},{"format":"CD","value":"2223-6317"}],"articleNumber":"6020944","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6020944","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a recognized algorithm for optimization problems, but suffers from premature convergence.

To overcome the drawback of requiring exact sparsity of the existing recovery algorithm, we introduce the Sparsity Adaptive Matching Pursuit (SAMP) method into reconstruction stage to search the support set of unknown signal vectors blindly.

The proposed structure can detect the signal degradation through TSVs due to resistive shorts in liner oxide and variations in resistance of TSV due to weak open and/or bonding resistance. For TSVs with moderate signal degradations, the proposed structure reconfigures itself as signal recovery circuit to maintain signal fidelity. This allows electrical repair of TSVs with moderate defects leading to better design yield and system functionality. This paper presents the design of the test and recovery structure and demonstrates their effectiveness through stand alone simulations as well as in a full-chip physical design of a 3-D IC.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2166961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6081119/06021335.pdf","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2166961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-Bond and Post-Bond Test and Signal Recovery Structure to Characterize and Repair TSV Defect Induced Signal Degradation in 3-D System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021335/","displayDocTitle":"Pre-Bond and Post-Bond Test and Signal Recovery Structure to Characterize and Repair TSV Defect Induced Signal Degradation in 3-D System","volume":"1","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360068","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021335/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-Bond and Post-Bond Test and Signal Recovery Structure to Characterize and Repair TSV Defect Induced Signal Degradation in 3-D System","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-cho-2166961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047685S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6081119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6081119","articleId":"6021335","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021341,"authors":[{"name":"Pieter J.

Static read margins were observed to overestimate failures by 10-100 X while static write margins failed to predict outliers in critical writeability. Critical writeability was demonstrated to exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to process variations, random telegraph noise (RTN), and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), compared to static write margins.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021345/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12315628","volume":"46","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Dynamic SRAM Stability in 45 nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Dynamic SRAM Stability in 45 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-toh-2164300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137378S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6056707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6056707","articleId":"6021345","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021346,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hsin Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","MediaTek, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6021346/6021346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Hsin Tseng received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan, in 2002.

In our previous work, we had proposed margin propagation (MP) as an efficient piecewise linear (PWL) approximation technique to a log-sum-exp function and had demonstrated its advantages for implementing probabilistic decoders. In this paper, we present a systematic and a generalized approach for synthesizing analog piecewise-linear (PWL) computing circuits using the MP principle. MP circuits use only addition, subtraction and threshold operations and hence can be implemented using universal conservation principles like the Kirchoff's current law. Thus, unlike the conventional translinear CMOS current-mode circuits, the operation of the MP circuits are functionally similar in weak, moderate, and strong inversion regimes of the MOS transistor making the design approach bias-scalable. This paper presents measured results from MP circuits prototyped in a 0.5 \u03bcm standard CMOS process verifying the bias-scalable property. As an example, we apply the synthesis approach towards designing linear classifiers and we verify its performance using measured results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6139305/06021350.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Bias-Scalable CMOS Analog Computational Circuits Using Margin Propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Current measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","MOSFETs","Decoding","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","MOSFET","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analog computational circuits","margin propagation","pattern recognizers","communication decoders","sensory processing algorithms","piecewise linear approximation technique","log-sum-exp function","probabilistic decoders","analog piecewise-linear computing circuits","Kirchoff's current law","CMOS current-mode circuits","MOS transistor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog computation","current-mode circuits","margin propagation (MP)","moderate-inversion circuits","piecewise-linear (PWL) circuit","translinear"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Bias-Scalable CMOS Analog Computational Circuits Using Margin Propagation","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6021350/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12489714","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Bias-Scalable CMOS Analog Computational Circuits Using Margin Propagation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chakrabartty-2163968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062913S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6139305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6139305","articleId":"6021350","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021351,"authors":[{"name":"Yeong-Luh Ueng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6139305/6021351/6021351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yeong-Luh Ueng received the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 2001.","From 2001 to 2005, he was with a private communication technology company, where he focused on the design and development of various wireless chips.

This paper presents an efficient layered decoder architecture for nonbinary quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes using the proposed barrel-shifter-based permutation network and minimum value filter which is used to determine the first few smallest values from a given set. Through the permutation network, the decoding operations related to the multiplications over finite fields can be efficiently handled in the check-node operations, which simplifies the permutations in the variable-node operations and, hence, enables the layered decoder to be realized efficiently. In order to increase the throughput, we utilize the proposed permutation network and the minimum value filter to devise a selective-input min-max decoder architecture. Using a 90-nm CMOS process, we implemented three nonbinary decoders to demonstrate the proposed techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","volume":"59","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12489715","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6021351/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Layered Decoding Architecture for Nonbinary QC-LDPC Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Layered Decoding Architecture for Nonbinary QC-LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ueng-2163889-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155481S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6139305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6139305","articleId":"6021351","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6021355,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6216496/6021355/6021355-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lili Cao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2011, all in computer science.","His research interests include wireless technologies and applications on mobile devices."]},"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Cao","id":"37407514300"},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6216496/6021355/6021355-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Haitao Zheng (M'99\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. degree (with highest honor) in electrical engineering from Xian Jiaotong University, Xian, China, in 1995, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1998 and 1999, respectively.","She joined the Wireless Research Lab, Bell-Labs, Lucent Technologies, Crawford Hill, NJ, as a Member of Technical Staff in 1999, and moved to Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, as a Project Lead and Researcher in 2004.

Conventional design of dynamic spectrum access focuses on maximizing spectrum utilization, but faces the problem of degraded reliability due to unregulated demands and access behaviors. Without providing proper reliability guarantee, dynamic spectrum access is unacceptable to many infrastructure networks and services. In this paper, we propose SPARTA, a new architecture for dynamic spectrum access that balances access reliability and spectrum utilization. SPARTA includes two complementary techniques: proactive admission control performed by a central entity to determine the set of wireless nodes to be supported with only statistical information of their spectrum demands, and online adaptation performed by admitted wireless nodes to adjust their instantaneous spectrum usage to time-varying demand. Using both theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that SPARTA fulfills the reliability requirements while dynamically multiplexing spectrum demands to improve utilization. Compared to conventional solutions, SPARTA improves spectrum utilization by 80%-200%. Finally, SPARTA also allows service providers to explore the tradeoff between utilization and reliability to make the best use of the spectrum. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to identify and address such a tradeoff.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12786479","htmlLink":"/document/6021355/","displayDocTitle":"Balancing Reliability and Utilization in Dynamic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing Reliability and Utilization in Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"tnet-zheng-2165966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128338S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6216496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6216496","articleId":"6021355","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6021358,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Sortomme","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6021358/6021358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eric Sortomme (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering (magna cum laude) from Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2011.","His employment experience includes internships with Wavetronix LLC and Puget Sound Energy.

This paper reviews research results related to the design of distributed automation systems with IEC 61499, the supporting tools and the aspects related to the execution of IEC 61499 on embedded devices. The promising application areas of IEC 61499 include flexible material handling systems, in particular airport baggage handling, flexible reconfigurable manufacturing automation, intelligent power distribution networks and SmartGrid, as well as the wide range of embedded networked systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEC 61499 as Enabler of Distributed and Intelligent Automation: State-of-the-Art Review","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2166785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6056501/06021366.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2166785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"IEC 61499 as Enabler of Distributed and Intelligent Automation: State-of-the-Art Review","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6021366/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12332418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEC 61499 as Enabler of Distributed and Intelligent Automation: State-of-the-Art Review","sourcePdf":"tii-vyatkin-2166785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131995S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6056501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"6056501","articleId":"6021366","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6021371,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Wai Hung","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6151934/6021371/6021371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kwok-Wai Hung (S'09) received the B.Eng.

To address the mismatch issue of \u201cgeometric duality\u201d during parameter estimation, the residuals (prediction errors) are weighted according to the geometric similarity between the pixel of interest and the residuals. The robustness of data estimation can be improved by modeling the weights of residuals with the well-known bilateral filter. Experimental results show that there is a 0.25-dB increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for a sample set of natural images after the suggested improvements are incorporated into the original SAI. The proposed algorithm produces the highest quality in terms of PSNR and subjective quality among sophisticated algorithms in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021371/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537615","pubMedId":"21937348","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Soft-Decision Interpolation Using Weighted Least Squares","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Soft-Decision Interpolation Using Weighted Least Squares","sourcePdf":"tip-siu-2168416-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062628S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6021371","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6021372,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuzhuang Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6129825/6021372/6021372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiuzhuang Zhou (M'11) received the B.Sc. degree from Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China, in 1996 and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the College of Information Engineering, Capital Normal University, Beijing.

While various particle filters and conventional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been proposed for visual tracking, these methods often suffer from the well-known local-trap problem or from poor convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based tracking scheme for the abrupt motion problem in the Bayesian filtering framework. To effectively handle the local-trap problem, we first introduce the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) sampling method into the Bayesian filter tracking framework, in which the filtering distribution is adaptively estimated as the sampling proceeds, and thus, a good approximation to the target distribution is achieved. In addition, we propose a new MCMC sampler with intensive adaptation to further improve the sampling efficiency, which combines a density-grid-based predictive model with the SAMC sampling, to give a proposal adaptation scheme. The proposed method is effective and computationally efficient in addressing the abrupt motion problem. We compare our approach with several alternative tracking algorithms, and extensive experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method in dealing with various types of abrupt motions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021372/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472228","pubMedId":"21937350","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Abrupt Motion Tracking Via Intensively Adaptive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abrupt Motion Tracking Via Intensively Adaptive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Sampling","sourcePdf":"tip-zhou-2168414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086246S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"6021372","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6021374,"authors":[{"name":"Thien-Nghia Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6157683/6021374/6021374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thien-Nghia Nguyen was born in Vietnam in 1981.

Environment perception comprises measuring the surrounding field with onboard sensors such as cameras, radar, lidars, etc., and signal processing to extract relevant information for the planned safety or assistance function. Relevant information is primarily supplied using two well-known methods, namely, object based and grid based. In the introduction, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods and subsequently present an approach that combines the two methods to achieve better results. The first part outlines how measurements from stereo sensors can be mapped onto an occupancy grid using an appropriate inverse sensor model. We employ the Dempster-Shafer theory to describe the occupancy grid, which has certain advantages over Bayes' theorem. Furthermore, we generate clusters of grid cells that potentially belong to separate obstacles in the field. These clusters serve as input for an object-tracking framework implemented with an interacting multiple-model estimator.

Faults are injected into the model in sequential levels and the system performance is assessed after each fault. Fault coverage-the probability that the system survives given a fault has occurred-is studied. A complete Markov reliability model is developed to assess the mean time to failure of the system and other reliability factors.

However, when the LLC converter is applied to wide input voltage range applications, the widely used fundamental harmonic approximation is incapable of guiding the design due to its inaccuracy. Thus an accurate LLC converter model is desired. In this paper, a generalized mode analysis is presented that provides highly accurate prediction on resonant current and voltage behavior and dc gain characteristic. Also, because operation modes are affected by load, frequency, and gain conditions, the boundaries and distribution of modes are discussed and illustrated. Based on the mode analysis, an approximation method is developed to estimate the peak gain point, which is useful in LLC design. This approximation demonstrates high accuracy within the simulation results. An experimental prototype is built to verify the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06021378.pdf","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation Mode Analysis and Peak Gain Approximation of the LLC Resonant Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021378/","displayDocTitle":"Operation Mode Analysis and Peak Gain Approximation of the LLC Resonant Converter","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543555","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021378/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation Mode Analysis and Peak Gain Approximation of the LLC Resonant Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-fang-2168545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088781S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6021378","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021379,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwei He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6021379/6021379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinwei He (S\u201910) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Jiangsu, China, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree from the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.

The proposed GCC scheme has a single-loop control of inverter output (voltage or current) and two parallel virtual impedance terms using additional measurements. The virtual impedance can be the equivalent internal impedance or external impedance (or both), depending on their control term and feedback variable selection. The internal impedance term is mainly responsible for providing desired damping to the filter circuit, and the external virtual impedance term can effectively adjust the converter system closed-loop output impedance. As each term in the GCC scheme can be controlled independently, the proposed GCC scheme has great flexibility and can easily realize and explain the performances of the traditional single- and multiloop control schemes and their different variations. Moreover, the GCC scheme provides a distinct physical meaning of each control term, which makes the control parameter tuning more straightforward and robust. Additionally, as shown in this paper, the proposed GCC scheme can tackle some traditionally challenging control objectives by avoiding the harmonics filtering or derivative terms. Experimental results from laboratory VSC prototypes are obtained to validate the proposed GCC scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06021379.pdf","startPage":"1850","endPage":"1861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Closed-Loop Control Schemes with Embedded Virtual Impedances for Voltage Source Converters with LC or LCL Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Closed-Loop Control Schemes with Embedded Virtual Impedances for Voltage Source Converters with LC or LCL Filters","volume":"27","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021379/","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543556","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Closed-Loop Control Schemes with Embedded Virtual Impedances for Voltage Source Converters with LC or LCL Filters","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2168427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114882S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"279","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6021379","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6021383,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark","Oticon A/S, Smorum, Denmark"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Guo","id":"38237112500"},{"name":"Thomas Bo Elmedyb","affiliation":["Oticon A/S, Smorum, Denmark"],"firstName":"Thomas Bo","lastName":"Elmedyb","id":"38229023300"},{"name":"S\u00f8ren Holdt Jensen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"S\u00f8ren Holdt","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37283443300"},{"name":"Jesper Jensen","affiliation":["Oticon A/S, Smorum, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37271733000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6021383","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":764},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency control","Stability criteria","Echo cancellers","Adaptive algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","audio signal processing","echo suppression","least squares approximations","loudspeakers","microphones","recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic feedback analysis","echo cancellation analysis","multiple-microphone systems","power transfer function method","single-loudspeaker audio processing system","beamformer processes","cancellation system","normalized least mean square","recursive least squares algorithms","adaptive algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive echo cancellation","adaptive feedback cancellation","convergence rate","steady-state behavior"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Acoustic Feedback/Echo Cancellation in Multiple-Microphone and Single-Loudspeaker Systems Using a Power Transfer Function Method","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","endPage":"5788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06021383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168523","startPage":"5774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021383","abstract":"In this work, we analyze a general multiple-microphone and single-loudspeaker audio processing system, where a multichannel adaptive system is used to cancel the effect of acoustic feedback/echo, and a beamformer processes the feedback/echo canceled signals. We introduce and derive an accurate approximation of a frequency domain measure - the power transfer function - and show how it can be used to predict the convergence rate, system stability bound and the steady-state behavior of the entire cancellation system across frequency and time. We consider three example adaptive algorithms in the cancellation system: the least mean square, normalized least mean square, and the recursive least squares algorithms. Furthermore, we derive expressions to determine the step size parameter in the adaptive algorithms to achieve a desired system behavior, e.g., convergence rate at a specific frequency. Finally, we compare and discuss the performance of all three adaptive algorithms, and we verify the derived expressions through simulation experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12358055","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Acoustic Feedback/Echo Cancellation in Multiple-Microphone and Single-Loudspeaker Systems Using a Power Transfer Function Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Acoustic Feedback/Echo Cancellation in Multiple-Microphone and Single-Loudspeaker Systems Using a Power Transfer Function Method","sourcePdf":"tsp-guo-2168523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061403S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6021383","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6021384,"authors":[{"name":"Vasilios I.

FFT is a highly important kernel and the performance of its software implementations depends on the memory hierarchy's utilization. FFTW minimizes register spills and data cache accesses by finding a schedule that is independent of the number of the registers and of the number of levels and size of the cache, which is a serious drawback. In this paper, a new methodology is presented, achieving improved performance by focusing on memory hierarchy utilization. The proposed methodology has three major advantages. First, the combination of production and consumption of butterflies' results, data reuse, FFT parallelism, symmetries of twiddle factors and also additions by zeros and multiplications by zeros and ones when twiddle factors are zero or one, are fully and simultaneously exploited. Second, the optimal solution is found according to the number of the registers, the data cache sizes, the number of the levels of data cache hierarchy, the main memory page size, the associativity of the data caches and the data cache line sizes, which are also considered simultaneously and not separate. Third, compilation time and source code size are very small compared with FFTW. The proposed methodology achieves performance gain about 40% (speed-up of 1.7) for architectures with small data cache sizes where memory management has a larger effect on performance and 20% (speed-up of 1.25) on average for architectures with large data cache sizes (Pentium) in comparison with FFTW.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06021384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","startPage":"6217","endPage":"6226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Speeding Up Fast Fourier Transform Focusing on Memory Architecture Utilization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Speeding Up Fast Fourier Transform Focusing on Memory Architecture Utilization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358056","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021384/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Speeding Up Fast Fourier Transform Focusing on Memory Architecture Utilization","sourcePdf":"tsp-kelefouras-2168525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064404S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6021384","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021385,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Qian","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/6021385/6021385-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Qian received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, both in harmonic analysis, from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1981 and 1984, respectively.","From 1984 to 1986, he worked in the Institute of Systems Science, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

For signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n) measurements, considerably smaller than the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n log(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n is the signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS. Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-term approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently calculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian distributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a piecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model selection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms of the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing measurements. A maximization-maximization (Max-Max) algorithm that iteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model selection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real image sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results compared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06021388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","startPage":"5842","endPage":"5858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Compressed Sensing of Gaussian Mixture Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Compressed Sensing of Gaussian Mixture Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358059","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021388/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Compressed Sensing of Gaussian Mixture Models","sourcePdf":"tsp-yu-2168521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111411S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6021388","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021389,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We assume that each node in the network is equipped with a single omnidirectional antenna and, motivated by the large body of physical layer research indicating its potential utility, that multiple nodes are able to coordinate their transmissions at the physical layer in order to take advantage of spatial diversity. Such coordination, however, is intrinsically intertwined with routing decisions, thus motivating the work. We first formulate the energy cost of forming a cooperative link between two nodes based on a two-stage transmission strategy assuming that only statistical knowledge about channels is available. Utilizing the link cost formulation, we show that optimal static routes in a network can be computed by running Dijkstra's algorithm over an extended network graph created by cooperative links. However, due to the variability of wireless channels, we argue that a many-to-one cooperation model in static routing is suboptimal. Hence, we develop an opportunistic routing algorithm based on many-to-many cooperation, and show that optimal routes in a network can be computed by a stochastic version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. We use static and opportunistic optimal algorithms as baselines to develop heuristic link selection algorithms that are energy efficient while being computationally simpler than the optimal algorithms. We simulate our algorithms and show that while optimal cooperation and link selection can reduce energy consumption by almost an order of magnitude compared to non-cooperative approaches, our simple heuristics achieve similar energy savings while being computationally efficient as well.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","startPage":"3813","endPage":"3823","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06021428.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-Energy Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks with Channel Variations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Transmitters","Relays","Receivers","Fading channels","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","omnidirectional antennas","radio networks","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum energy cooperative routing","wireless networks","channel variations","finding minimum energy cooperative routes","single omnidirectional antenna","optimal static routes","Dijkstra algorithm","Bellman Ford algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication","minimum energy routing","variable wireless channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-Energy Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks with Channel Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6021428/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12391194","publicationDate":"November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-Energy Cooperative Routing in Wireless Networks with Channel Variations","sourcePdf":"3813-tw1111-dehghan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065993S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021429,"authors":[{"name":"Kannan Govindan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kannan","lastName":"Govindan","id":"37590421100"},{"name":"Kai Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37285934000"},{"name":"Prasant Mohapatra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prasant","lastName":"Mohapatra","id":"37283726400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6021429","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1239},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"Probability density of the received power is well analyzed for wireless networks with static nodes. However, most of the present days networks are mobile and not much exploration has been done on statistical analysis of the received power for mobile networks in particular, for the network with random moving patterns. In this paper, we derive probability density of the received power for mobile networks with random mobility models. We consider the power received at an access point from a particular mobile node. Two mobility models are considered: Random Direction (RD) model and Random way-point (RWP) model. Wireless channel is assumed to have a small scale fading of Rayleigh distribution and path loss exponent of 4. 3D, 2D and 1D deployment of nodes are considered. Our findings show that the probability density of the received power for RD mobility models for all the three deployment topologies are weighted confluent hypergeometric functions. In case of RWP mobility models, the received power probability density for all the three deployment topologies are linear combinations of confluent hypergeometric functions. The analytical results are validated through NS2 simulations and a reasonably good match is found between analytical and simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06021429.pdf","startPage":"3613","endPage":"3619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability Density of the Received Power in Mobile Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Three dimensional displays","Network topology","Fading channels","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","Rayleigh channels","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["received power probability density","mobile networks","wireless networks","static nodes","statistical analysis","random mobility models","access point","mobile node","random direction mobility model","random way-point mobility model","wireless channel","Rayleigh distribution","ID deployment","RD mobility models","RWP mobility models","confluent hypergeometric functions","NS2 simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probability density of received power","RWP mobility","RD mobility","centralised network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Probability Density of the Received Power in Mobile Networks","volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6021429/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391195","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability Density of the Received Power in Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"3613-tw1111-govindan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060995S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021431,"authors":[{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory& State Key Laboratory (ISN), Information Science Institute, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6021431/6021431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weijia Han (S'07) received the B.S. degree from Northwest University, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from Queen's University Belfast, UK, in 2006.

However, existing sensing strategies do not handle satisfactorily the randomness of both user locations and channel conditions in the network environment, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization. To cope with such randomness, this paper develops three dynamic sensing strategies that can adaptively schedule the sensing slots/cycles according to the online link conditions without assuming knowledge of the PU traffic model. The proposed strategies can improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization while being robust with respect to the uncertainty in the PU traffic pattern. To maximize spectrum utilization, the proposed strategies are formulated through closed-form expressions. Efficient methods are introduced to compute the optimal values of the parameters used in the strategies, such as sensing time and sensing threshold. Simulations verify that the proposed sensing strategies offer an evident improvement on the spectrum utilization of the CR network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12391196","htmlLink":"/document/6021431/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Sensing Strategies for Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Sensing Strategies for Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3644-tw1111-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103736S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021432,"authors":[{"name":"Man Hon Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6021432/6021432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Man Hon Cheung (S'06) received the B.Eng. and M.Phil. degrees in Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

While most of the previously proposed MAC protocols for CR networks are heuristic and are based on the simplistic protocol model, we design a distributed MAC protocol using the more accurate signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model. First, we assume that the secondary users are cooperative and formulate the problem of assigning transmission and listening probabilities for random access as a non-convex network utility maximization problem. We propose a three-phase algorithm that converges to a near-optimal solution after solving a number of convex optimization problems distributively. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm based on the SINR model achieves a higher aggregate throughput than other schemes which are based on the protocol model. Then, we consider the case that the secondary users are rational. We use coalitional game theory to study the incentive issues of user cooperation in a given channel for the SINR model. In particular, we use the solution concept of the core to analyze the stability of the grand coalition, and the solution concept of the Shapley value to fairly divide the payoff among the users. We show that the Shapley value lies in the core when all the users are one-hop neighbours of each other. We illustrate the Shapley value and the core with a numerical example.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.110154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06021432.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.110154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3887","endPage":"3897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR-Based Random Access for Cognitive Radio: Distributed Algorithm and Coalitional Game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"SINR-Based Random Access for Cognitive Radio: Distributed Algorithm and Coalitional Game","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021432/","volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6021432/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391197","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR-Based Random Access for Cognitive Radio: Distributed Algorithm and Coalitional Game","sourcePdf":"3887-tw1111-cheung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094805S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021433,"authors":[{"name":"Amiotosh Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6021433/6021433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amiotosh Ghosh is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Concordia University, Montreal.

To overcome the multipath fading in underground tunnels, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) and Cooperative Communication system can be utilized. Since the underground channel characteristics are significantly different from those in terrestrial environments, the channel capacity and the outage behavior of such systems need to be investigated based on underground tunnel channel models, which had not been addressed by the research community yet. In this paper, the capacity distribution and outage probability of MIMO and cooperative communication systems are investigated in underground tunnel environments. Explicit formulas of the capacity distribution and outage probability are developed as functions of environmental conditions and system configurations. Based on the capacity and outage analysis in underground tunnels, the optimal MIMO antenna geometry design scheme is proposed for MIMO systems; and the cooperative relay assignment protocol is developed for cooperative communication systems. Simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06021435.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.080611.102077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","startPage":"3793","endPage":"3803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Outage Analysis of MIMO and Cooperative Communication Systems in Underground Tunnels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Outage Analysis of MIMO and Cooperative Communication Systems in Underground Tunnels","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391200","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021435/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Outage Analysis of MIMO and Cooperative Communication Systems in Underground Tunnels","sourcePdf":"3793-tw1111-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068739S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021437,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin R.

Such systems often employ pilot symbols to estimate wireless channels, and null subcarriers on band edges to reduce adjacent channel interference. Recent work has focused on designing the pilot sequence to improve channel estimation performance. In this paper, we present a new pilot design for OFDM systems based on a arbitrary-order polynomial parameterization of the pilot subcarrier indices. We show our design achieves better performance than existing methods. Theoretical models and simulated performance demonstrate the increased accuracy of our design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/06021437.pdf","startPage":"3145","endPage":"3150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.090611.101922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.090611.101922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Pilot Design for Channel Estimation with Null Edge Subcarriers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Bit error rate","Convex functions","Polynomials","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","polynomials","radiocommunication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high-data rate transmission","null edge subcarrier","adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","OFDM system","arbitrary-order polynomial parameterization","subcarrier indices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","pilot design","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Pilot Design for Channel Estimation with Null Edge Subcarriers","volume":"10","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6021437/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359550","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Pilot Design for Channel Estimation with Null Edge Subcarriers","sourcePdf":"3145-tw1110-hamilton.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0582S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6021437","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6021438,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Derakhshani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6021438/6021438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahsa Derakhshani received her B.Sc. degree and M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

As the SUs simultaneously measure the spectral correlation functions at different cycle-frequencies (CF) and exchange their information regarding the measured results, a sufficient number of CFs are effectively examined with parallel searching, which makes the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing more reliable. This paper presents another look at performance evaluation of cyclostationary detectors in terms of deflection coefficients. Outage probability of deflection coefficient is defined as a measure to compare the performance of different cyclostationary detectors in a fading channel. Furthermore, performance of the proposed schemes in terms of false-alarm and detection probabilities is evaluated by analysis and simulation in AWGN and fading channels. Illustrative and analytical results show that the proposed schemes outperform both SC and multi-cycle (MC) cyclostationary detectors, especially in fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","volume":"10","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12391202","publicationDate":"November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021438/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Cooperative Cyclostationary Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios at Low SNR Regimes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Cooperative Cyclostationary Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios at Low SNR Regimes","sourcePdf":"3754-tw1111-derak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06844S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6021438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6021463,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Hijjeh","affiliation":["Palestinian Cellular Communication, Palestine"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Hijjeh","id":"37086657194"},{"name":"Ayman Al-Dasht","affiliation":["B.Sc.

A lot of patients in tuberculosis medical center cause the doctors and the technicians have heavy duty. Our research result can be used to reduce technician involvement in screening for tuberculosis and would be useful in laboratories. This research is early step to find appropriate method for identifying tuberculosis bacteria. The analysis of sputum smear requires highly trained to avoid high errors. It needs an appropriate pattern recognition and classification of tuberculosis bacteria. Before classification, geometric features of tuberculosis cell image are found from its binary image. The geometric features of tuberculosis cell image consist of circularity, compactness, eccentricity, and tortuosity. These geometric features would become inputs to the neural network trained with backpropagation method. The 100 samples would be divided into 75 training samples and 25 testing samples. After getting optimum weights and architectures of neural network with 20 neurons hidden layer, 0.05 learning rate, and 0.9 momentum, this network is used for classifying tuberculosis bacteria into two categories: tuberculosis bacteria or not. Results presented for several image taken from different binary cell image show that neural network classifies the presence of tuberculosis bacteria image accurately with mean square error 0.000368, error classification zero in training and testing processes for the data that is used in this research.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021502","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of tuberculosis bacteria using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of tuberculosis bacteria using neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12245988","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021502/","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of tuberculosis bacteria using neural network","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120488S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6021508,"authors":[{"name":"Ardimas Andi Purwita","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Ardimas Andi Purwita","id":"37088089094"},{"name":"Arnaud Setio","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Setio","id":"37085583620"},{"name":"Trio Adiono","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Trio","lastName":"Adiono","id":"37370695100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0752-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0753-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0751-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6822"}],"articleNumber":"6021508","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":407},"abstract":"Turbo code is a high performance channel coding which is able to closely reach the channel capacity of Shannon limit.

In deregulated systems, line congestion attract additional penalties which add on to the overall operational cost to be incurred by the Independent System Operators (ISO), apart from causing limit violations, and stability problems. Thus, limiting the congestion level of lines and restricting power flows within the safe limits is important from stability as well as economy point of view. The algorithm proposed in the present paper uses a Standard Sensitivity Index to identify the congested zone(s) in a large power network and then adopt corrective actions for limiting line congestion at the cost of a nominal rescheduling cost without any load curtailment and installation of FACTS devices. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce congestion even below the minimum level obtained from the conventional cost optimization results. It has been depicted that the methodology on application can provide better operating conditions in respect of improvement of bus voltage profile. The efficiency of the proposed methodology has been tested on a IEEE 30 bus benchmark system and the results look promising.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021544","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021544.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alleviation of line congestion using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021544/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Alleviation of line congestion using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021544/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12246027","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alleviation of line congestion using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.171417S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6021587,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The architecture employs eight 1-D DCT processors and four post-addition stages to calculate two-dimensional DCT coefficients. Each 1-D DCT processor is designed using Algebraic Integer Encoding architecture which requires no multiplier, therefore the entire proposed 2-D DCT design is multiplierless. Critical path is further shortened by employing five pipeline stages on each compression and decompression system. The proposed image compression system design has a latency of 5 clock cycles. A synthesis result targeting 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology has proven that the system is able to work in up to 210.684 MHz frequency. Throughput of the compression system can reach 42.02 million macroblocks per second, given that each macroblock consists of 8 \u00d7 8 pixels. The proposed design can be claimed to have reached satisfying throughput-area trade-off, given that it yields 6.8 times higher throughput to compensate for the 2.1 times larger area, compared to conventional row-column decomposition based 2-D DCT with 32 multipliers in the 1-D DCT. The aforementioned trade-off is better than several two-dimensional DCT designs that have been published.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI design of a high-throughput discrete cosine transform for image compression systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021587","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021587.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"VLSI design of a high-throughput discrete cosine transform for image compression systems","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021587/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12246066","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI design of a high-throughput discrete cosine transform for image compression systems","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087089S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6021605,"authors":[{"name":"Samsu Sempena","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Bandung/School of Electrical Information Engineering, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Samsu","lastName":"Sempena","id":"37086680022"},{"name":"Nur Ulfa Maulidevi","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Bandung/School of Electrical Information Engineering, Bandung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Nur Ulfa Maulidevi","id":"38235205400"},{"name":"Peb Ruswono Aryan","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Bandung/School of Electrical Information Engineering, Bandung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Peb Ruswono Aryan","id":"37086682393"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0752-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0753-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0751-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6822"}],"articleNumber":"6021605","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Quaternions","Joints","Cameras","Heuristic algorithms","Computer vision","Tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","content-based retrieval","feature extraction","human computer interaction","image motion analysis","time series","video retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human action recognition","dynamic time warping","computer vision","human computer interaction","content based video retrieval","athletic performance analysis","DTW","human joints","feature vector","3D real world coordinate system","time series","joint orientation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human action recognition","exemplar-based approach","Dynamic Time Warping","depth camera"]}],"abstract":"Human action recognition is gaining interest from many computer vision researchers because of its wide variety of potential applications.

For improving recognition rate, we perform body part tracking using depth camera to recover human joints body part information in 3D real world coordinate system. We build our feature vector from joint orientation along time series that invariant to human body size. Dynamic Time Warping is then applied to the resulted feature vector.

It was introduced in 3GPP release 6 and has been developed in recent release in term of enhanced MBMS (eMBMS). Current eMBMS can support two kinds of transmission, namely Single-cell transmission (in this mode the MBMS data only can be transmitted inside one single cell coverage) and Multi-cell transmission (in this mode the MBMS data are sent by different cells that are tightly synchronized), which also known as Single Frequency Network (SFN). In SFN all base stations transmit the same signal at the same time and over the same frequency channel to user equipment. In SFN, the transmissions received from multiple cells will, as seen from the UE, appear as a single transmission subject to severe multipath propagation. SFN can bring benefit whichs changes the interference or destructive signal to constructive signal and contain longer cyclic prefix than conventional transmission. Femtocells are low-power wireless access points that operate in licensed spectrum to connect standard mobile devices to a mobile operator's network using residential DSL or cable broadband connections. Current Macrocells could support indoor coverage but with some limitations caused by thick walls, high locations and other indoor obstacles. Those were a challenges need to be solved and Femtocells offers more efficient solutions to handle indoor coverage. When first introduced, Femtocells can solved the poor quality of indoor voice and data services. When those problems are solved, more services demanded to be supported by Femtocell, e.g. multimedia services.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021623","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) in LTE based Femtocell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021623/","displayDocTitle":"Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) in LTE based Femtocell","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12246098","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021623/","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) in LTE based Femtocell","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070151S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6021632,"authors":[{"name":"Sawan Sen","affiliation":["EE Department, Techno India, Salt Lake, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sawan","lastName":"Sen","id":"37864511400"},{"name":"Sandip Chanda","affiliation":["EE Department, Techno India, Salt Lake, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Chanda","id":"37860772000"},{"name":"S.

Each one has different style of writing. One simple way to differentiate is Kanji have more strokes than Kana. Meanwhile, it needs a lot of effort to remember characters of Katakana and Hiragana, thus it will be very difficult to distinguish handwritten Katakana and Hiragana, since there are a lot of similar characters. This is the reason why we need pattern recognition. Handwriting recognition has been the object of intensive research during the last decades, including Japanese characters recognition. In this research, we build an application to recognize Kana's character handwriting. Pattern recognition on Kana is started based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) consist of scan image, preprocessing, feature extraction and post-processing. Classification process will be done in post-processing using neural network back propagation. The processing of input images, involves training and testing image. Training image uses 3.956 characters done in three phases of training. Testing image uses 552 characters of some images inputted in training phase and image which has not been used before. The test result achieve maximum accuracy of recognition system at 91.88% from train image and 31.03% from test image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021648/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12246123","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021648/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Japanese character (Kana) pattern recognition application using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Japanese character (Kana) pattern recognition application using neural network","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059824S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6021675,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Behzad Fallahpour","affiliation":["Young Researcher Club of Lahijan Islamic Azad University"],"lastName":"Mojtaba Behzad Fallahpour","id":"37062310300"},{"name":"Kamran Delfan Hemmati","affiliation":["Sadjad Institute of Higher Education, Mashhad, Iran"],"lastName":"Kamran Delfan Hemmati","id":"37086741859"},{"name":"Ali Pourmohammad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Pourmohammad","id":"37541418400"},{"name":"Abbas Golmakani","affiliation":["Sadjad Institute of Higher Education, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Golmakani","id":"37705131100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0752-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0753-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0751-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6822"}],"articleNumber":"6021675","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021675","abstract":"In this paper an accurate method is presented for determining of the device sizes in a RF circuit based on genetic algorithm (GA).

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules.

A new severity function model that utilises the voltage collapse prediction index is also considered in this assessment method. The performance of the generalised regression neural network is evaluated using mean absolute and mean square errors.

Several methods have been proposed to combine the forecasting results into single forecast, namely the simple averaging, weighted average on validation performance, or non-parametric combination schemas. Recent literature uses dimensional reduction method for individual prediction and employs ordinary least squares for forecast combination. Other literature combines prediction results from neural networks using dimensional reduction techniques. Thus, those previous combination schemas can be categorized into linear combination methods. This paper aims to explore the use of non-linear combination method to perform the ensemble of individual predictors. We believe that the non-linear combination method may capture the non linear relationship among predictors, thus, may enhance the result of final prediction. The Neural Network (NN), which is widely used in literature for time series tasks, is used to perform such combination. The dataset used in the experiment is the time series data designated for NN5 Competition. The experimental result shows that forecast combination using NN performs better than the best individual predictors, provided that the predictors selected for combination have fairly good performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021770/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12246238","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021770/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combination of time series forecasts using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination of time series forecasts using neural network","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096891S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021774,"authors":[{"name":"Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra","id":"37073430600"},{"name":"Rella Mareta","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rella","lastName":"Mareta","id":"38484297600"},{"name":"Nurfitri Anbarsanti","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nurfitri","lastName":"Anbarsanti","id":"37085431377"},{"name":"Trio Adiono","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Trio","lastName":"Adiono","id":"37370695100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0752-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0753-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0751-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6822"}],"articleNumber":"6021774","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Image coding","Equations","Quantization","Complexity theory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mCBE algorithm","multiplication from common binary expression algorithm","DCT-IDCT image compression architecture","discrete cosine transforms","multiplication decomposition","shifter-adder component","quantization number","JPEG recommendation number","FathQuantz number","1D-DCT design","frequency 709.22 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DCT/IDCT architecture","multiplierless","low complexity","mCBE Algorithm","FathQuantz Numbers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021774","endPage":"6","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficient mCBE algorithm and quantization numbers for multiplierless and low complexity DCT/IDCT Image Compression Architecture","abstract":"This paper presents a multiplierless and low complexity of DCT/IDCT Image Compression Architecture by using two approaches.

We named it as multiplication from Common Binary Expression (mCBE) Algorithm. Second, we propose alternative quantization numbers which can be simply implemented as shifter in digital hardware. These numbers can also retain good quality of compressed image compared to JPEG recommendation numbers. We named them as FathQuantz Numbers. Those improvements lead our proposed architecture becomes multiplierless and low complexity. The result states that our proposed 8-points 1D-DCT design has only 6 stages and 8-points 1D-IDCT design has only 7 stages. Here, we define 1 stage is equal to shifter or 2-inputs adder delay. So, by pipelining method, we can achieve high speed architecture with latency as trade off consideration.

One way to support it is by classifying and filtering ethernet packets within network devices. Packet classification is a fundamental task for network devices such as routers, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. In this paper we present architecture of fast and reconfigurable Packet Classification Engine (PCE). This engine is used in FPGA-based firewall. Our PCE inspects multi-dimensional field of packet header sequentially based on tree-based algorithm. This algorithm simplifies overall system to a lower scale and leads to a more secure system. The PCE works with an adaptation of single cycle processor architecture in the system. Ethernet packet is examined with PCE based on Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port, Destination Port, and Protocol fields of the packet header. These are basic fields to know whether it is a dangerous or normal packet before inspecting the content. Using implementation of tree-based algorithm in the architecture, firewall rules are rebuilt into 24-bit sub-rules which are read as processor instruction in the inspection process. The inspection process is comparing one sub-rule with input field of header every clock cycle. The proposed PCE shows 91 MHz clock frequency in Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 with 13 clocks throughput average from input to output generation. The use of tree-based algorithm simplifies the multidimensional packet inspection and gives us reconfigurable as well as scalable system. The architecture is fast, reliable, and adaptable and also can maximize the advantages of the algorithm very well. Although the PCE has high frequency and little amount of clock, filtering speed of a firewall also depends on the other components, such as packet FIFO buffer. Fast and reliable FIFO buffer is needed to support the PCE. This PCE also is not completed with rule update mechanism yet. This proposed PCE is tested as a component of FPGA-based firewall to filter Ethernet packet with FPGA DE2 Board using NIOS II platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and reconfigurable packet classification engine in FPGA-based firewall","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021782","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast and reconfigurable packet classification engine in FPGA-based firewall","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021782/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12246250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and reconfigurable packet classification engine in FPGA-based firewall","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057013S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6021783,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper, we present the utilization of compressive sampling to encode video signal efficiently and compare the results with existing video coding standard, i.e. MPEG-4. A frame is first divided into blocks of identical size, and then a sparsity transform is employed to represent the block in a sparser domain. After that, the coefficients will undergo projection transform in order to reduce the data size according to a preset measurement rate. For a more prominent compression ratio, we can apply lower measurement rate. However, this rate also has to comply with the sparsity level of the signal. At the decoder side, a reconstruction algorithm will be conducted by means of basis pursuit or L1 minimization to guarantee acceptable accuracy. A greater compression factor can be achieved by integrating the motion compensation and estimation techniques with compressive sensing. Inter-frame coding will decrease the number of significant coefficients, hence enhancing the sparse property. For slow motion video, we need fewer reference frames. The group-of-picture size can be made adaptive, i.e. depending on current error level reported by a feedback link from decoder. Principally, the main difference between compressive video sensing and existing video coding is the use of projection matrix to sample the coefficients randomly. After sparsification and projection, the signal may experience subsequent processes, such as quantization, run-length coding, as well as entropy coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011492/6021499/06021803.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study on video coding techniques with compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","PSNR","Compressed sensing","Encoding","Discrete cosine transforms","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image sampling","matrix algebra","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion video coding technique","sampling rate","Nyquist rate","compressive sampling utilization","MPEG-4","video signal encoding standard","sparsity transform","sparser domain","projection transform","measurement rate","reconstruction algorithm","L1 minimization","motion compression factor","interframe coding","sparse property","group-of-picture size","error level","feedback link","compressive video sensing","projection matrix","run-length coding","entropy coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","video coding","basis pursuit","compressed sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study on video coding techniques with compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12246268","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study on video coding techniques with compressive sensing","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044857S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011492","isNumber":"6021499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011492","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6021499","articleId":"6021803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6021834,"authors":[{"name":"Andriyan Bayu Suksmono","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Andriyan Bayu","lastName":"Suksmono","id":"37273736600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0752-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0753-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0751-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6822"}],"articleNumber":"6021834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","TV","Time frequency analysis","Optimization","Brownian motion","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brownian motion","data compression","discrete Fourier transforms","interpolation","matrix algebra","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","stock markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional Brownian motion signal reconstruction","sparse samples","compressive sampling","interpolation method","1/f property","power law decay","Hurst parameter","DFT","discrete Fourier transform","sparsity basis","random matrix","US-DJIA","Dow Jones industrial average stock index monthly values time series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sampling","fractional Brownian motion","interpolation","financial time-series","fractal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021834","abstract":"This paper proposes a new fBm (fractional Brownian motion) interpolation/reconstruction method from partially known samples based on CS (Compressive Sampling).

Hurst parameter H that occurs in the power law determines the sparsity level, therefore the CS reconstruction quality of an fBm signal for a given number of known subsamples will depend on H. However, the proposed method does not require the information of H to reconstruct the fBm signal from its partial samples. The method employs DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) as the sparsity basis and a random matrix derived from known samples positions as the projection basis. Simulated fBm signals with various values of H are used to show the relationship between the Hurst parameter and the reconstruction quality.

These metrics aim to emulate the integral mechanisms of the human visual system (HVS) to correlate well with visual perception of quality. One integral property of the HVS is, however, often neglected: visual attention (VA) [1]. The essential mechanisms associated with VA consist mainly of higher cognitive processing, deployed to reduce the complexity of scene analysis. For this purpose, a subset of the visual information is selected by shifting the focus of attention across the visual scene to the most relevant objects. By neglecting VA, perceptual quality models inherently assume that all objects draw the attention of the viewer to the same degree.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2011.942473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6021440/06021861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2011.942473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021440","startPage":"50","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Attention in Quality Assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visual Attention in Quality Assessment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328575","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6021861/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Attention in Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"28msp06-engelke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088393S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6021440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6021440","articleId":"6021861","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6021868,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad M.

The prime focus is bridging theory and practice, that is, to pinpoint the potential of sub-Nyquist strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. In this spirit, we integrate contemporary theoretical viewpoints, which study signal modeling in a union of subspaces, together with a taste of practical aspects, more specifically how the avant-garde modalities boil down to concrete signal processing systems.

It has been reported by many research groups and is becoming a viable alternative for 3D television. With the development of 3D integral imaging, image compression becomes mandatory for the storage and transmission of 3D integral images. In this paper, the use of the lifting scheme in the application of a 3D Wavelet Transform for the compression of 3D Integral Images is proposed. The method requires the extraction of different viewpoint images from an integral image. The 3D wavelet decomposition is computed by applying three separate 1D transforms along the coordinate axes of the given sequence of Viewpoint Images. The spatial wavelet decompositions on a single viewpoint and on the inter-viewpoint images are performed using the biorthogonal Cohen-Debauchies-Feauveau 9/7 and 5/3 filter banks, respectively. All the resulting wavelet coefficients from application of the 3D wavelet decomposition are arithmetic encoded. Simulations are performed on a set of different grey level 3D Integral Images using a uniform scalar quantizer with deadzone. The results for the average of the four intensity distributions are presented and compared with previous use of 2D DWT and 3D-DCT based schemes. It was found that the algorithm achieves better rate-distortion performance and reconstructs the images with much better image quality at very low bit rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/6021884/06021885.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"592","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2011.2159359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2011.2159359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression of 3D Integral Images Using 3D Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Image coding","Discrete wavelet transforms","Microoptics","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integral image compression","3D wavelet transform","3D television","3D integral image transmission","1D transforms","spatial wavelet decompositions","interviewpoint images","biorthogonal Cohen-Debauchies-Feauveau filter banks","grey level 3D integral images","uniform scalar quantizer","uniform scalar deadzone","2D DWT","3D-DCT based schemes","rate-distortion performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image compression","3D imaging","3D TV","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compression of 3D Integral Images Using 3D Wavelet Transform","volume":"7","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6021885/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12242149","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of 3D Integral Images Using 3D Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"jdt-aggoun-2159359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064312S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"6021884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6021884","articleId":"6021885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6021886,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Alzoubi","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Binghamton University State University of New York, Vestal, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9425/6021884/6021886/6021886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khalid Alzoubi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Jordan, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in industrial and systems engineering with a specialization in electronics manufacturing from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 2010.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the Center of Autonomous Solar Power (CASP), State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY.

To produce flexible devices, flexible substrates should replace conventional glass substrates. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is the preferred transparent conducting layer used in the display technology. Although ITO has excellent sheet resistance and very good optical properties, ITO can crack at very low tensile strains which might cause failure in the conductive layer because of the unusual structure of a very thin film of brittle ceramic material applied to a polymer substrate. Therefore, the mechanics of ITO on flexible substrates has been thoroughly considered in the design and manufacturing of flexible devices. In a typical roll-to-roll manufacturing process, many challenges exist during the travel of the coated web over the rollers which produce bending stresses that might cause failure even if the stresses are below the yield strength of the material. Therefore, the high cycle bending fatigue of ITO thin films on flexible substrates is of a significant importance. In this work, high cycle bending fatigue experiments were conducted on ITO coated PET substrate. The effect of bending diameter, bending frequency, and sample width on the change in electrical resistance was investigated. High magnification images were obtained to observe crack initiation and propagating in the ITO layer. The goal of this work is to establish a baseline for a comprehensive reliability study of ITO thin films on flexible substrate. It was found that bending diameters as well as the number of bending cycles have a great influence on the electrical conductivity of the ITO layer.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021884","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/6021884/06021886.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2011.2151830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2011.2151830","startPage":"593","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bending Fatigue Study of Sputtered ITO on Flexible Substrate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021886/","displayDocTitle":"Bending Fatigue Study of Sputtered ITO on Flexible Substrate","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6021886/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12242150","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bending Fatigue Study of Sputtered ITO on Flexible Substrate","sourcePdf":"jdt-alzoubi-2151830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06645S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"6021884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6021884","articleId":"6021886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6021901,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan-gen Wang","affiliation":["SHANDONG University, Mechanical engineering, JiNan, CHINA"],"firstName":"Zhan-gen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088153191"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6021901","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021901","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021901","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06021901.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"139","endPage":"142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Hybrid grey theories and BP algorithm neural network forecast model in logistics park","abstract":"Retracted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: This document was removed from IEEE Xplore in accordance with IEEE policy.

However, its further development is restricted by its characteristic of \u201cblack box\u201d because it can't explain how learning from input data was done and how performance can be consistently ensured. In order to open the \u201cblack box\u201d, a novel approach of regression rules extraction from ANN based on Least Squares is proposed in this paper, it can uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of ANN. Its main concepts are that the nonlinear activation function of each hidden unit is approximated locally by a three-piece linear function based on Least Squares and then the regression rules are generated by decision tree approach. The piecewise linear regression rules can not only ensure the accuracy but also enhance the explanation. Experiments on two public datasets show that the proposed approach generates rules are more accurate than the existing approaches based on decision trees or linear regression.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021906","startPage":"203","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06021906.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression rules extraction from artificial neural network based on least squares","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021906/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Regression rules extraction from artificial neural network based on least squares","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6021906/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12262244","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression rules extraction from artificial neural network based on least squares","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070147S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6021899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6021899","articleId":"6021906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6021912,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ji","id":"37089118935"},{"name":"Yawen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yawen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086671954"},{"name":"Xiaowei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086672874"},{"name":"Jiangbin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, HuaZhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jiangbin","lastName":"Wu","id":"38195256100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6021912","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021912","abstract":"The handwritten recognition is an important but difficult problem and the back propagation neural network (BP neural network) is the common solution. However, considering the shortcoming that BP neural network can easily be trapped in the local optimal solutions and have slow convergence, this paper proposes a new method to improve the performance with the combination of BP neural network and the quantum immune algorithm (QIA). This method which we called AQICA-BP can accelerate the convergent rate and escape from the local optimal in time. Thus we apply the AQICA-BP to the handwritten recognition problems and the results prove its feasibility. Moreover, we compare it with both single BP and QIA-BP, it shows that the new model is desirable.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021912","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06021912.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6021912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative combination of quantum immune algorithm and back propagation neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Quantum computing","Optimization","Handwriting recognition","Immune system","Quantum mechanics","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","handwriting recognition","neural nets","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum immune algorithm","backpropagation neural network","handwriting recognition","BP neural network","AQICA-BP method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["handwritten recognition","alternating optimization","back propagation neural network","quantum immune algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6021912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Alternative combination of quantum immune algorithm and back propagation neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6021912/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262250","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative combination of quantum immune algorithm and back propagation neural network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062813S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6021899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6021899","articleId":"6021912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6021917,"authors":[{"name":"Daiyuan Zhang","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, CN"],"firstName":"Daiyuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37597921100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6021917","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Interpolation","Polynomials","Training","Neurons","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pad\u00e9 weight function","neural networks training","network topology","learning speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","algorithm","Weight function","Pad\u00e9 Approximants"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6021917","abstract":"A new algorithm using Pad\u00e9 weight function for training neural networks is proposed in this paper with simple network topology constituted by two layers: input layer and output layer.

Recent progress in silicon photonics research has enabled the demonstration of all the necessary optical building blocks for creating extremely high-bandwidth density and energy-efficient links for on-chip and off-chip communications. From the feasibility and architecture perspective however, photonics represents a dramatic paradigm shift from traditional electronic network designs due to fundamental differences in how electronics and photonics function and behave. As a result of these differences, new modeling and analysis methods must be employed in order to properly realize a functional photonic chip-scale interconnect design. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing and modeling fundamental photonic building blocks which can subsequently be combined to form full photonic network architectures. We also describe a set of tools which can be utilized to assess the physical-layer and system-level performance properties of a photonic network. The models and tools are integrated in a novel open-source design and simulation environment. We present a case study of two different photonic networks-on-chip to demonstrate how our improved understanding and modeling of the physical-layer details of photonic communications can be used to better understand the system-level performance impact.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6022003/06022004.pdf","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2157157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2157157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-Layer Modeling and System-Level Design of Chip-Scale Photonic Interconnection Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Optical waveguides","Solid modeling","Optical losses","Multiprocessor interconnection","Computational modeling","Optical crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","integrated optoelectronics","network-on-chip","optical design techniques","optical interconnections","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical-layer modeling","system-level design","electronic chip-scale photonic interconnection networks","silicon photonics","high-bandwidth density","energy-efficient links","off-chip communications","photonic network architectures","open-source design","photonic networks-on-chip","photonic communications","IEEE","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communications","optical crosstalk","optical losses","photonic interconnection networks","simulation software","system analysis and design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Physical-Layer Modeling and System-Level Design of Chip-Scale Photonic Interconnection Networks","volume":"30","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6022004/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12230362","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical-Layer Modeling and System-Level Design of Chip-Scale Photonic Interconnection Networks","sourcePdf":"tcad-chan-2157157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115684S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6022003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6022003","articleId":"6022004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6022005,"authors":[{"name":"Tongquan Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tongquan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37410847100"},{"name":"Xiaodao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403979900"},{"name":"Shiyan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shiyan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290175500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"6022005","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":844},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Schedules","Program processors","Circuit faults","Processor scheduling","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","fault tolerance","integer programming","linear programming","power aware computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability-driven energy-efficient task scheduling scheme","multiprocessor real-time embedded systems","energy consumption","stochastic fault occurrences","integer linear program","fault adaptation variable","dynamic power","leakage power","independent task scheduling","precedence constraint task","-driven parallel scheduling scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficient","multiprocessor system","real-time systems","reliability","task scheduling"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a reliability-driven task scheduling scheme for multiprocessor real-time embedded systems that optimizes system energy consumption under stochastic fault occurrences.

However, a priority service for the guaranteed latency causes the SDRAM utilization and latency of an overall system to be degraded critically. In addition, the data size of SDRAM requested by various cores is not matched with an SDRAM access granularity such that the SDRAM utilization and latency are further deteriorated. In this paper, we propose an application-aware networks-on-chip (NoCs) design for an efficient SDRAM access, which can consider memory latency demands and memory access granularities in various applications. In order to provide short latency for priority memory requests with few penalties, memory request packets are scheduled by our guaranteed SDRAM service router that includes a hybrid flow controller of priority-first and priority-equal algorithms. In addition, our SDRAM access granularity matching NoC design further improves the memory performance by splitting a memory request packet to several short memory request packets and then controlling the short memory request packets with a partially open-page mode and an auto-precharge operation in a memory subsystem. Experimental results show that our cost-effective application-aware NoC design significantly improves, on average, memory latency for latency-sensitive cores up to 32.8%, overall memory latency up to 7.8%, and memory utilization up to 3.4%, compared to the state-of-the-art SDRAM-aware NoC design .","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"30","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12242057","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022008/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application-Aware NoC Design for Efficient SDRAM Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Aware NoC Design for Efficient SDRAM Access","sourcePdf":"tcad-jang-2160176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100051S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6022003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6022003","articleId":"6022008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6022011,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6022003/6022011/6022011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Liu was born in Beijing, China, on September 23, 1984.

They either have good efficiency but highly depend on the accuracy of the equivalent circuit models, which may fail the synthesis when the frequency is high, or they fully depend on electromagnetic (EM) simulations, with a high solution quality but are too time consuming. To address the problem of combining high solution quality and good efficiency, a new method, called memetic machine learning-based differential evolution (MMLDE), is presented. The key idea of MMLDE is the proposed online surrogate model-based memetic evolutionary optimization mechanism, whose training data are generated adaptively in the optimization process. In particular, by using the differential evolution algorithm as the optimization kernel and EM simulation as the performance evaluation method, high-quality solutions can be obtained. By using Gaussian process and artificial neural network in the proposed search mechanism, surrogate models are constructed online to predict the performances, saving a lot of expensive EM simulations. Compared with available methods with the best solution quality, MMLDE can obtain comparable results, and has approximately a tenfold improvement in computational efficiency, which makes the computational time for optimized component synthesis acceptable. Moreover, unlike many available methods, MMLDE does not need any equivalent circuit models or any coarse-mesh EM models. Experiments of 60 GHz syntheses and comparisons with the state-of-art methods provide evidence of the important advantages of MMLDE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","volume":"30","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12230365","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6022011/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Integrated Passive Components for High-Frequency RF ICs Based on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Integrated Passive Components for High-Frequency RF ICs Based on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning Techniques","sourcePdf":"tcad-liu-2162067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080463S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6022003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6022003","articleId":"6022011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6022024,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Tao","affiliation":["Department Of Biomedical Engineering, Nanjing University Of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Tao","id":"37590295200"},{"name":"Zhi-Yu Qian","affiliation":["Department Of Biomedical Engineering, Nanjing University Of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Yu","lastName":"Qian","id":"37290652100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022024","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"abstract":"Medical image fusion has very important value of application for medical image analysis and diagnosis. In this paper, the traditional method of wavelet fusion is improved and a new algorithm of medical image fusion is presented. When choosing high frequency coefficients, the regional edge intensities of each sub-image are calculated to realize adaptive fusion. The low frequency coefficient choosing is based on edges of images, so that the fused image can preserve all useful information and appears clearly. We apply the traditional and improved fusion algorithms based on wavelet transform to fuse images and also evaluate the fusion results. Experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively retain detail information of original images and enhance their edge and texture features. This new algorithm is better than traditional fusion algorithm based on wavelet transform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06022024.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved medical image fusion algorithm based on wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Medical diagnostic imaging","Image edge detection","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image fusion","image texture","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image fusion algorithm","wavelet transform","medical image analysis","medical image diagnosis","wavelet fusion method","adaptive fusion","image edge","texture features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["medical image fusion","wavelet transform","fusion algorithm","quality evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An improved medical image fusion algorithm based on wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6022024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262269","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved medical image fusion algorithm based on wavelet transform","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056075S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6021899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6021899","articleId":"6022024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6022047,"authors":[{"name":"Bingyuan Lu","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bingyuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37851516700"},{"name":"Bayi Cheng","affiliation":["School of Management, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bayi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38006129100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022047","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022047","abstract":"For the fuzzy time phenomenon caused by factors such as traffic and roads in distribution process, based on trapezoidal fuzzy number, this article gives one kind of vehicle scheduling problem model with fuzzy time window.

In the GSPSO, the PSO model is used to find a good local search space, which the global optimization point is contained with high probability, and the GSO model is used to search in the local search space, and the rangers are used to revise the local search space at the same time. A mutual rescue method is also proposed for switching the two models. Moreover, a mechanism of weeding out the weak members is also established to increase the diversity of particles. Four benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the novel algorithm.

In weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms, subtractive clustering is used to find center prototypes and then weighted mean methods are used to create new centers. Three weighted mean methods are tried to create more effective centers. Comparative experiments were executed between subtractive clustering and three weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms on five benchmark datasets. Next, the performance of RBF neural networks set with the proposed algorithms was studied. The experimental results suggest that all three weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms can find more accurate centers and can be successfully applied to design RBF neural networks. The RBF neural networks determined by weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms have rather simpler network architecture but with slightly lower classification accuracy than ones determined by subtractive clustering algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022115","startPage":"517","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06022115.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing RBF neural networks with weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022115/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Designing RBF neural networks with weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6022115/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12262354","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing RBF neural networks with weighted mean subtractive clustering algorithms","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080352S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6021899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6021899","articleId":"6022115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6022118,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenzhen Yuan","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Zhenzhen","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086793919"},{"name":"Shuang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Quality Technology, Supervision Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089083070"},{"name":"Linyan Xue","affiliation":["Department of Quality Technology, Supervision Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Linyan","lastName":"Xue","id":"37532942000"},{"name":"Xiu'e Yuan","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Xiu'e","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086791624"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022118","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022118","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022118","startPage":"526","endPage":"529","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6021899","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6021899/06022118.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Short-term load forecasting based on chaos theory and RBF neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022118/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Short-term load forecasting based on chaos theory and RBF neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"12262357","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: This document was removed from IEEE Xplore in accordance with IEEE policy.

An improved PSO algorithm based on the attractive and repulsive PSO (ARPSO) is proposed to train FNN in this paper. In addition to the phases of repulsion and attraction, the third phase named as mixed phase is introduced in the improved PSO, in which the particles are attracting and compelling simultaneously to prevent premature convergence. Moreover, an improved mutation operation is taken to help particles jump out of local minima when the current global best position has not been changed for some predetermined iterations in the improved PSO. Since the improved PSO could improve the diversity of the swarm to avoid premature convergence, it has better convergence performance than traditional PSOs. Finally, the experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on function approximation and iris classification problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022153/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12268378","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6022153/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved ARPSO for feedforward neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved ARPSO for feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055778S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6022138","articleId":"6022153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6022154,"authors":[{"name":"Yisheng An","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Chang'an University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yisheng","lastName":"An","id":"37266256300"},{"name":"Qingsong Song","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Chang'an University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qingsong","lastName":"Song","id":"37404646800"},{"name":"Xiangmo Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering Chang'an University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiangmo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37406840200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022154","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022154","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Reservoirs","Prediction algorithms","Neurons","Training","Recurrent neural networks","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","time series","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term traffic flow forecasting","state neural networks","ESN","recurrent neural networks","RNN","simpler training method","time series signals","traffic flaw data records","feed forward neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["echo state neural networks","traffic flow","prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022154","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022138/06022154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"844","endPage":"847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term traffic flow forecasting via echo state neural networks","abstract":"An algorithm for short term traffic flaw prediction based on echo state neural networks (ESN) is proposed in this paper.

The adaptive allocation algorithm can be adopted to raise the frequency spectrum efficiency and satisfy the users' quality of service (QoS). An adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on the IEEE802.16 OFDM system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, each sub-carrier chooses one user who has the biggest intermediate value. Then the bit load algorithm of the single user can be introduced to determine the number of bit and power of each sub-carrier. Finally the resources adjustment can be adopted according to the service priority. The simulation results demonstrate that the transmission rate is higher than comparison algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022157","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022138/06022157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022138","startPage":"1043","endPage":"1047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on IEEE802.16 OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on IEEE802.16 OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268382","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on IEEE802.16 OFDM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055521S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6022138","articleId":"6022157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6022159,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-guang Li","affiliation":["School of Informatics, GDUFS, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xin-guang","lastName":"Li","id":"37677759700"},{"name":"Min-feng Yao","affiliation":["School of Informatics, GDUFS, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Min-feng","lastName":"Yao","id":"38243301500"},{"name":"Wen-tao Huang","affiliation":["School of Automation, GDUT, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-tao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086646376"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022159","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech recognition","Neural networks","Classification algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Mathematical model","Support vector machine classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","neural network ensembles","BP neural network","k-means clustering algorithm","nearest clustering center","ensemble learning","local convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["k-means clustering","neural network ensembles","speech recognition Introduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022159","abstract":"Aiming at the disadvantages of the single BP neural network in speech recognition, a method of speech recognition based on k-means clustering and neural network ensembles is presented in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a new vision-based system for near-range pedestrian collision detection. The low-level system uses a bio-inspired visual neural network, which emulates the visual system of the locust, to detect visual cues relevant to objects in front of a moving car. At a higher level, the system employs a neural-network classifier to identify dangerous pedestrian positions, triggering an alarm signal. The system was tuned via simulation and tested using recorded video sequences of real vehicle impacts. The experiment results demonstrate that the system is able to discriminate between pedestrians in dangerous and safe positions, triggering alarms accordingly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near range pedestrian collision detection using bio-inspired visual neural networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022169","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022138/06022169.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Near range pedestrian collision detection using bio-inspired visual neural networks","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6022169/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268393","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near range pedestrian collision detection using bio-inspired visual neural networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082673S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6022138","articleId":"6022169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6022173,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Guo","affiliation":["College of Forestry, He'nan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, P.

This paper proposes a self-organizing fuzzy neural network controller (SOFNNC) with group-based genetic algorithm (GGA) to drive the internal climate of the greenhouse. SOFFNNC is a hybrid control strategy which combines fuzzy control and neural network organically. It generates or prunes neurons automatically by the structure learning algorithm, which can adaptively strike a balance between the rule number and the desired performance. In other to avoid the shortage of the original learning algorithm to SOFNNC, we come up with an improved structure learning method and a new parameter learning method with GGA. Based on a greenhouse model established by an Elman neural network (ENN), we test the performance of SOFNNC. Simulation and comparison results prove that SOFNNC can achieve outstanding control effect with high efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022188","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022138/06022188.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"648","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a self-organizing fuzzy neural network controller with group-based genetic algorithm to greenhouse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of a self-organizing fuzzy neural network controller with group-based genetic algorithm to greenhouse","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12268412","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022188/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a self-organizing fuzzy neural network controller with group-based genetic algorithm to greenhouse","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094283S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6022138","articleId":"6022188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6022217,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Hang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, CHINA"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Hang","id":"37428365100"},{"name":"Guofei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, CHINA"],"firstName":"Guofei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38251765200"},{"name":"Yinan Mo","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, CHINA"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Mo","id":"38555789600"},{"name":"Xiaohui Hu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University City College, CHINA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37656923600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022217","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022217","abstract":"In this paper, a new Hamming neural network integrated circuit using neuron-MOS transistor is presented.

In many industries including manufacturing, logistics, computer etc., researchers use evolutionary algorithms to solve sophisticated optimization problems which have stationary or shifty optimal values. These problems could hardly be solved with precise mathematical methods, called non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of those algorithm and attracts extra attention. In this paper, we put forward a new model to explore the step length of search process of PSO, via statistics methods. Typical two-dimensional and multi-dimensional benchmark functions are used to generate empirical data for further analysis. L\u00e9vy flight search patterns finally proved to play an important role in the searching process. Then the relationship between the values of scaling parameters in power law distributions and the efficiency of PSO is discussed. More interesting results are given in discussion.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022225","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1189","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural

Therefore, developing an intelligent DC Servomotor position control scheme and, in particular, a DC Servomotor Neural Model based on a well-defined mathematical model that can be used for off-line simulation are very important tools for this type of system's drives. Multiple non-linear parameters and dynamic factors, such as Dead Zone, Saturation, Coulomb Friction, Backlash and load changes, are of most concern when controlling servomotors' angular position. Due to these nonlinearities and dynamic factors, conventional control schemes such as PID control may not be the best solution for some applications because they result in low system efficiency. To reduce the effect of these nonlinearities and dynamic factors and to improve the system's efficiency, an intelligent Neural Network (NN) Controller is proposed. In this paper we are reporting the use of a combination of a DC Servomotor Neural Model and a Neural Network controller. The proposed NN combination is able to deal with the non-linear parameters and dynamic factors found in the original system, and is able to improve the overall system efficiency.

The static task scheduling problem is NP-complete in its general form. The complexity of the problem increase when task scheduling is to be done in a heterogeneous environment, where the processors in the network may not be identical and take different amounts of time to execute the same task. This paper presents an activity-based genetic task scheduling algorithm for the tasks run on the network of heterogeneous systems and represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). First, a list scheduling algorithm is incorporated in the generation of the initial population of a GA to represent feasible operation sequences and diminish coding space when compared to permutation representation. Second, the algorithm assigns an activity to each task which is assigned on the processor, and then the quality of the solution will be improved by adding the activity and the random probability in the crossover and mutation operator. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated by comparing with the existing effectively scheduling algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022138","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022138/06022236.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022236","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An activity-based genetic algorithm approach to multiprocessor scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022236/","displayDocTitle":"An activity-based genetic algorithm approach to multiprocessor scheduling","htmlLink":"/document/6022236/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"12268458","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An activity-based genetic algorithm approach to multiprocessor scheduling","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049712S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6022138","articleId":"6022236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6022237,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Teng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Teng","id":"37528705000"},{"name":"Aizeng Cao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Jinan Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Aizeng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37531843400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022237","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Logistics","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Logic gates","Quantum computing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","genetic algorithms","logistics","quantum computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","piecewise logistic chaotic map","local minimum","premature constringency","chaos optimization method","fuzzy adaptive mode","global searching","local searching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","chaos optimization","Piecewise Logistic map","fuzzy adaptive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022237","abstract":"Aiming at the trouble of easy getting into local minimum and premature constringency existed in quantum genetic algorithm, this paper presents a new algorithm through analyzing the characteristic of Piecewise Logistic map.

This filter is derived from the input-balanced realization (IBR) that yields an excellent performance against finite precision errors. With such a realization, the stability of the adaptive filter can be ensured easily. As well known, the traditional gradient based adaptive algorithms cannot jump out of local minima of a cost function. To overcome this problem, the PSO, one of the intelligent optimization techniques, is employed. As the filter is implemented in a state space realization, we formulate a new cost function to include the PSO in the adaptive filter. This process is universal on any state-space realization based filters. Numerical examples show that the proposed adaptive filter yields a satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022267","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1826","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022259/06022267.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An input-balanced realization based adaptive IIR filter using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Real time systems","Stability analysis","Chaos","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering theory","IIR filters","particle swarm optimisation","stability","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input-balanced realization","adaptive IIR filter","particle swarm optimization","finite precision error","adaptive filter stability","PSO","intelligent optimization technique","state space realization","cost function","infinite impulse response filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An input-balanced realization based adaptive IIR filter using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6022267/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262375","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An input-balanced realization based adaptive IIR filter using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118873S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","xplore-issue":"6022259","articleId":"6022267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6022268,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Hydrosciences, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086736906"},{"name":"Jian-feng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Hydrosciences, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37879059400"},{"name":"Xiao-bin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Hydrosciences, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-bin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37878822000"},{"name":"Ji-chun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Hydrosciences, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ji-chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37066366000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022268","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022268","abstract":"The two primary goals of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for solving multi-objective optimization problems are to search as much non-dominated solutions as possible towards the true Pareto front and to maintain diversity of Pareto optimal solutions along tradeoff curves.

Computational results indicate that the proposed NPTSGA is an efficient and effective method for solving multi-objective problems, while keeping the balance between the intensification of non-domination to the true Pareto-optimal solutions (TPS) and the diversification of the near Pareto-optimal solutions (NPS) along the tradeoff curves.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022268","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1236","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022259/06022268.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for finding pareto optimal set in multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Search problems","Evolutionary computation","Pareto optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","Pareto tabu search","genetic algorithm","Pareto-optimal solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","niched Pareto tabu search","genetic algorithm","Pareto optimality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for finding pareto optimal set in multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6022268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262376","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for finding pareto optimal set in multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066509S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6022259","articleId":"6022268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6022282,"authors":[{"name":"Huijie Yu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huijie","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086667800"},{"name":"Lian Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Management, Shanghai Finance University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086664409"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022282","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Fuzzy control","Joints","Fuzzy neural networks","Control systems","Artificial neural networks","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","manipulator dynamics","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot arms trail controller","dynamic model","fuzzy neural network controller","system simulation analysis","fuzzy controller","fuzzy neural network control methods","trail track","fuzzy control method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robot arm","track","fuzzy","nerual network","intelligent control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022282","abstract":"From the dynamic model of robot arm, a new fuzzy neural network controller is proposed to control the robot arm's trail in this paper.

Genetic Linear Projections (GLP) is one of the latest linear feature extraction approaches. The major drawback of applying GLP to sparse linear feature extraction is that it may encounter a small sample size problem. In this work, GLP is reviewed in a practical, problem-oriented context, and then goes to examine potential application in sparse linear feature extraction to abate the required sample support by combining the feature grouping techniques with the evolutionary optimizer based linear feature extraction approach. Simulation results manifest that the satisfying performance of sparse linear feature extraction can be obtained by using an alternative approach to try to describe the sparse structure in the scenario where the sample size is small.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Optimization","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Training","Finite element methods","Sparse

effective emergency evacuation plans. And due to the large scale and numbers of evacuees in real evacuation, real tests are impractical. Therefore, the simulation of evacuation becomes a wonderful choice in program planning. Particle Swarm is as one of the multi-agent based simulation method that can simulate complex behaviors of individuals. NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) is a kind of optimization method for multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (named as PNMO, Particle swarm & NSGA-II based Multi-objective Optimization) which simulates evacuation process as well as optimizing the generated evacuation plans. The experiment shows that this method possesses superior performance in evacuation planning.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022332","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1269","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022259","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022259/06022332.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm and NSGA-II based evacuation simulation and multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022332/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm and NSGA-II based evacuation simulation and multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6022332/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12262419","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm and NSGA-II based evacuation simulation and multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053424S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6022259","articleId":"6022332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6022333,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxiao Niu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qingxiao","lastName":"Niu","id":"37086644017"},{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085775767"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086646163"},{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536547000"},{"name":"Guangping Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guangping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37397238200"},{"name":"Yanbing Xue","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and System, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yanbing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37596845800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022333","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"abstract":"A new shape contour description method based on eight-direction chain code and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed. Firstly, chain code tracks shape boundary sequentially, according to the relationship between contour and chain-code projection-transform value. A constructed chain-code function of contour is transformed using FFT. After optimization, then a new Fourier Constant Factor Descriptor is proposed which is called FCFD. The descriptor is independent of initial point and has rotation, shift and scale (RSS) invariant properties. The results of experiments show that our shape contour description method based on FFT reduces computation and improves the efficiency of data processing effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022259/06022333.pdf","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1812","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A shape contour description method based on chain code and Fast Fourier Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Shape","Frequency domain analysis","Mathematical model","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape contour description method","fast Fourier transform","eight-direction chain code","chain-code projection-transform value","Fourier constant factor descriptor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chain code","contour","FFT","RSS","FCFD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A shape contour description method based on chain code and Fast Fourier Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6022333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262420","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A shape contour description method based on chain code and Fast Fourier Transform","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093224S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6022259","articleId":"6022333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6022340,"authors":[{"name":"Lanxiang Zhong","affiliation":["School of Information and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Lanxiang","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37558098300"},{"name":"Zhiyong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086772827"},{"name":"Wanxu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wanxu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086776423"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022340","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","Acoustics","Ultrasonic imaging","Planar arrays","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial beamforming","amplitude weighting method","radiation phase shifting","planar array","radiation pattern","radiation energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beam forming","phased array","amplitude weighting"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm of spatial beamforming in far-field using amplitude weighting method","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022259","endPage":"1816","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022259/06022340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022340","startPage":"1813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022340","abstract":"Using amplitude weighting instead of phase shifting of radiation emitted by planar array, an algorithm for forming a specific radiation pattern in far-field was proposed, and the formula of calculating amplitude value was derived.

The directional information is introduced in local search process of the self-learning operator. And the search direction is guided by the pseudo-gradient of the function. By competition, cooperation and learning among the individuals, best solution is updated continuously. And a deletion operator is proposed in order to increase the population diversity, which avoid premature convergence and improve the algorithm convergence speed. Theoretical analysis has proved that DSLGA has the characteristic of global convergence. In experiment, DSLGA was tested by 5 unconstrained high-dimensional functions, and the results were compared with MAGA. Finally, the DSLGA was applied to optimal parameters estimation for Muskingum model, and compared with GAGA and MAGA. The experiment and application results show that DSLGA performs much better than the above algorithms both in quality of solutions and in computational complexity. So the effectiveness of algorithm is obvious.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022399","startPage":"1964","endPage":"1968","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural

reduce the cost of measurement and control, as well as improve productive efficiency. Different from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in non-industrial areas, IWSNs has high requirements for reliability, especially for large-scale industry application. As the network architecture has great influences on the performance of IWSNs, this paper discusses the node placement problem in IWSNs. Considering the reliability requirements, the setup cost and energy balance in IWSNs, the node placement model of IWSNs is built and an adaptive mutation probability binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (AMPBPSO) is proposed to solve this model. Experimental results show that AMPBPSO is effective for the optimal node placement in IWSNs with various kinds of field scales and different node densities and outperforms discrete binary Particle Swarm Optimization (DBPSO) and standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) in terms of network reliability, load uniformity, total cost and convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262524","htmlLink":"/document/6022417/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal node placement in industrial Wireless Sensor Networks using adaptive mutation probability binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal node placement in industrial Wireless Sensor Networks using adaptive mutation probability binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058777S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6022384","articleId":"6022417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6022424,"authors":[{"name":"Gaojin Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computing and Digital Engineering"],"firstName":"Gaojin","lastName":"Wen","id":"37605070300"},{"name":"Shengzhong Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computing and Digital Engineering"],"firstName":"Shengzhong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37552789200"},{"name":"Yanyi Wan","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computing and Digital Engineering"],"firstName":"Yanyi","lastName":"Wan","id":"37086746369"},{"name":"Pingchuang Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computing and Digital Engineering"],"firstName":"Pingchuang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38239783900"},{"name":"Senlin Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Computing and Digital Engineering"],"firstName":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086744126"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9953-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9950-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9952-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-9555"}],"articleNumber":"6022424","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022424","abstract":"As cloud computing is expected to expand rapidly in the coming years, the large-scale computing and data centers are becoming more and more widespread in the world.

Application Scheduling can alleviate this problem by reducing the number of running nodes and effectively maximizing total system efficiency. This paper focuses on scheduling applications in large-scale data centers using genetic algorithm. Specifically, we present the design and implementation of the cost function, the modification of the genetic operators and the choice of the data transition weight. The algorithm is studied via simulation and implementation in a large-scale data center. Test results and performance discussion justify the feasibility of the scheduling algorithm.

algorithm based radix-4 FFT processor is presented which is primarily intended to be used in power harmonic signal processing. The processor is implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that is characteristics of high efficiency, low cost, convenient implementation and short development cycle, and its performance is found to be satisfactory. The choice of the CORDIC algorithm for realizing the basic butterfly operation for the FFT which eliminates the need for storing twiddle factors and angles saves a lot of hardware compared to its counterparts employing other techniques. A dual-port memory structure and the corresponding addressing scheme are used to realize the in-place data access. The address generation unit required for fetching data from and writing results into the dual-port memory in proper sequence, is also incorporated within the chip which houses the controller as well.

This is the enabling component for many important applications, such as security monitor, vehicle detection and human activity analysis. Out of many common motion detection algorithms, mixture Gaussian background modeling can perform more accurate results and requires relatively less computation when processing static background. However, as the resolution of the frames increases and real-time processing requirement is proposed, sequential processor can't finish the computation in time. In this paper, a full pipelined and parallel Gaussian background modeling and the whole motion detection system are proposed on Altera Stratix IV FPGA. Due to the parallel architecture, the system can process real world 1024*1280 video at more than 30 frames per second, which is the real-time requirement, and the system can achieve the same accuracy as the software version on experimental datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022578","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012803/6022384/06022578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6022384","startPage":"2078","endPage":"2081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based mixture Gaussian background modeling and motion detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based mixture Gaussian background modeling and motion detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022578/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12262586","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022578/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based mixture Gaussian background modeling and motion detection","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050419S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012803","isNumber":"6022384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012803","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6022384","articleId":"6022578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6022735,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Hijjeh","affiliation":["Palestine Cellular Communication Ltd., Ramallah, Palestine"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Hijjeh","id":"37086657194"},{"name":"Anwar Abu Afeefeh","affiliation":["Palestine Polytechnic University, Hebron, Palestine"],"firstName":"Anwar Abu","lastName":"Afeefeh","id":"37086783466"},{"name":"Linda Manasrah","affiliation":["Palestine Polytechnic University, Hebron, Palestine"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Manasrah","id":"37086783402"},{"name":"Wala A.

The proposed model and its analysis are validated by means of finite-element analysis (FEA) and experimental results. Furthermore, as a viable solution for high-power (multikilowatt) applications, losses in the WPT system are investigated in the following section. Because of the high operating frequency (in megahertz), skin and proximity effects were shown to be dominant. A new spatial layout of a coil is proposed that significantly reduces losses caused by skin and proximity effects. With the new spatial layout, i.e., the surface spiral layout, the efficiency and size of WPT system can be improved significantly in high-power applications.

To improve system stability and prevent power couplings, the virtual impedances can be placed between interfacing converter outputs and the main grid. However, optimal design of the impedance value, robust implementation of the virtual impedance, and proper utilization of the virtual impedance for DG performance enhancement are key for the virtual impedance concept. In this paper, flexible small-signal models of microgrids in different operation modes are developed first. Based on the developed microgrid models, the desired DG impedance range is determined considering the stability, transient response, and power flow performance of DG units. A robust virtual impedance implementation method is also presented, which can alleviate voltage distortion problems caused by harmonic loads compared to the effects of physical impedances. Furthermore, an adaptive impedance concept is proposed to further improve power control performances during the transient and grid faults. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the impedance design approach, the virtual impedance implementation method, and the proposed adaptive transient impedance control strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2168592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6082064/06022775.pdf","startPage":"2525","endPage":"2538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2168592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Implementation of Virtual Impedance for Power Electronics Interfaced Distributed Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Design, and Implementation of Virtual Impedance for Power Electronics Interfaced Distributed Generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022775/","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12359947","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6022775/","volume":"47","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Design, and Implementation of Virtual Impedance for Power Electronics Interfaced Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"tia-li-2168592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085628S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6082064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"429","xplore-issue":"6082064","articleId":"6022775","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6022781,"authors":[{"name":"Osman S.

Depending on the converter structure, the converter thermal performance determines the converter power density and reliability. To estimate the converter thermal performance, the converter structure-based power loss and thermal models are developed in this study for the medium-voltage (MV) three-level active neutral-point-clamped voltage source converter (3L-ANPC-VSC) utilizing 4500 V-1800 A press-pack insulated-gate bipolar transistor-diode pairs and interfacing a 6 MW wind turbine to a MV grid. The switching power loss models are built using the experimental switching power loss data acquired via the double-pulse tests conducted on a full-scale 3L-ANPC-VSC prototype. The converter static thermal model is developed based on the double-sided water-cooled press-pack switches. Via a single-phase test setup with two full-scale 3L-ANPC-VSC legs, the developed power loss and thermal models are validated experimentally. Employing the validated models, the 3L-ANPC-VSC's thermal performance is demonstrated on simulation for a 6 MW wind turbine grid interface. Hence, these converter structure-based models developed and validated in this study are proven to be suitable for the converter power density and reliability studies based on converter thermal performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2168557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2168557","startPage":"2505","endPage":"2515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6082064/06022781.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Converter Structure-Based Power Loss and Static Thermal Modeling of The Press-Pack IGBT Three-Level ANPC VSC Applied to Multi-MW Wind Turbines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Converter Structure-Based Power Loss and Static Thermal Modeling of The Press-Pack IGBT Three-Level ANPC VSC Applied to Multi-MW Wind Turbines","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","volume":"47","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6022781/","accessionNumber":"12359952","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022781/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Converter Structure-Based Power Loss and Static Thermal Modeling of The Press-Pack IGBT Three-Level ANPC VSC Applied to Multi-MW Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tia-senturk-2168557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150764S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6082064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6082064","articleId":"6022781","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6022785,"authors":[{"name":"Bader N.

The MMF space harmonic amplitude and frequency depend on the particular combination of numbers of slots and poles. Such harmonics induce losses in the rotor since they are not synchronous with the rotor speed. This paper compares several kinds of machines with the same stator lamination but with different numbers of phases; three-, five-, and seven-phase PM machines are considered. Several winding configurations are compared, changing the number of poles but maintaining the same number of slots. Although in each case there is a reduction in terms of harmonic content, it is shown that rotor loss reduction is lower than expected. Some considerations about the harmonic impact are given. Although no experimental results are given, this paper refers to previous works in which rotor losses have been investigated and measured experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2168794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6146784/06022788.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2168794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slot Harmonic Impact on Rotor Losses in Fractional-Slot Permanent-Magnet Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022788/","displayDocTitle":"Slot Harmonic Impact on Rotor Losses in Fractional-Slot Permanent-Magnet Machines","volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12801674","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6022788/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slot Harmonic Impact on Rotor Losses in Fractional-Slot Permanent-Magnet Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-fornasiero-2168794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066458S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6146784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6146784","articleId":"6022788","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6022789,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchao Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Power Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6220909/6022789/6022789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuchao Shi received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008.","Since September 2008, he has been a doctor candidate of electrical engineering in Tsinghua University.

In this paper, the identification on permanent magnet flux of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) under position sensorless control is investigated. A rotor-flux-oriented vector control with model reference adaptive system (MRAS)-based rotor position/speed estimation is employed as the basic control strategy for IPMSM drive. An identification scheme based on extended Kalman filter for the permanent magnet flux of IPMSM is proposed. By using this scheme, the identification problems due to low-order state equations of IPMSM can be avoided. Based on these works, the online permanent magnet flux identification of IPMSM with rotor position/speed senseless control is realized. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control methods, which shows that the estimation error of rotor position based on the identified permanent magnet flux is limited within a very low level.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6220909/06022789.pdf","startPage":"4169","endPage":"4178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2168792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2168792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6220909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Identification of Permanent Magnet Flux Based on Extended Kalman Filter for IPMSM Drive With Position Sensorless Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Permanent magnets","Rotors","Kalman filters","Equations","Stators","Permanent magnet motors","Sensors","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","machine vector control","magnetic flux","model reference adaptive control systems","nonlinear filters","parameter estimation","permanent magnet motors","position control","sensorless machine control","synchronous motor drives","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online identification","extended Kalman filter","IPMSM drive","position sensorless control","rotor position-speed control","AC motor drives","motor parameters","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","rotor-flux-oriented vector control","model reference adaptive system","MRAS","rotor position-speed estimation","low-order state equations","online permanent magnet flux identification","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extended Kalman filter (EKF)","flux identification","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM)","sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online Identification of Permanent Magnet Flux Based on Extended Kalman Filter for IPMSM Drive With Position Sensorless Control","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6022789/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"12804819","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Identification of Permanent Magnet Flux Based on Extended Kalman Filter for IPMSM Drive With Position Sensorless Control","sourcePdf":"tie-shi-2168792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071694S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6220909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6220909","articleId":"6022789","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6022791,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6151927/6022791/6022791-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Hu received the B.S. degree in information and computation science and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Both the sectorlike nonlinearities and the norm-bounded uncertainties enter into the system in random ways, and such randomly occurring uncertainties and randomly occurring nonlinearities obey certain mutually uncorrelated Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences. The mixed time delays consist of both the discrete and the distributed delays. The time-varying delays are allowed in state. By employing the idea of delay fractioning and constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the stability of the system dynamics in the specified sliding surface by solving a certain semidefinite programming problem. A full-state feedback SMC law is designed to guarantee the reaching condition.

In UW-OFDM the cyclic prefixes (CPs) are replaced by deterministic sequences, the so-called unique words (UWs). The UWs are generated by appropriately loading a set of redundant subcarriers. By that a systematic complex number Reed-Solomon (RS) code construction is introduced in a quite natural way, because an RS code may be defined as the set of vectors, for which a block of successive zeros occurs in the other domain w.r.t. a discrete Fourier transform. (For a fixed block different to zero, i.e., a UW, a coset code of an RS code is generated.) A remaining problem in the original systematic coded UW-OFDM concept is the fact that the redundant subcarrier symbols disproportionately contribute to the mean OFDM symbol energy. In this paper we introduce the concept of non-systematic coded UW-OFDM, where the redundancy is no longer allocated to dedicated subcarriers, but distributed over all subcarriers. We derive optimum complex valued code generator matrices matched to the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) and to the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) data estimator, respectively. With the help of simulations we highlight the advantageous spectral properties and the superior bit error ratio (BER) performance of non-systematic coded UW-OFDM compared to systematic coded UW-OFDM and to CP-OFDM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN ) as well as in frequency selective environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Systematic Complex Number RS Coded OFDM by Unique Word Prefix","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2168522","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06022809.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2168522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Non-Systematic Complex Number RS Coded OFDM by Unique Word Prefix","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6022809/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425219","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Systematic Complex Number RS Coded OFDM by Unique Word Prefix","sourcePdf":"tsp-hofbauer-2168522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6022809","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6022812,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6129945/6022812/6022812-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Wang received the B.S. degree from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011.","He is currently an Engineer with the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center (CNCERT/CC), Beijing, China.

The seamless information spread is used to guarantee that messages are correctly received by each vehicle, regardless of whether it pulls into broadcast zones or not. We first derive the maximum throughput of the V2I downlink system for both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels with Doppler effects. A measurement-based algorithm to estimate the throughput is also proposed. We then discuss the maximum achievable amount of information that can be relayed forward along a vehicular stream. A network coding technique will then be proposed to cancel the interference caused by relay signals to vehicles that are receiving messages from the corresponding information center. These theoretical results will give more insight into the vehicular communication system design.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2167249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","startPage":"62","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06022812.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Joint V2I and V2V Scheduling for Cooperative VANETs With Network Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022812/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Joint V2I and V2V Scheduling for Cooperative VANETs With Network Coding","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471773","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Joint V2I and V2V Scheduling for Cooperative VANETs With Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2167249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084806S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6022812","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6022813,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.

Our optimization strategy is to minimize error vector magnitude (EVM) with constraints of PAPR and free carrier power overhead. Then, a nonconvex quadratic program is obtained, which is computationally difficult. By utilizing the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, the optimization model is relaxed to a semidefinite program, which can be efficiently solved using polynomial time. On top of this, we use the rank minimization technique to improve the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized OFDM signals have quasi-constant PAPR values and are not sensitive to the nonlinear effects of the power amplifier in comparison with other approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06022813.pdf","startPage":"4662","endPage":"4667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2168614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2168614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimized EVM via Semidefinite Relaxation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Optimization","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","OFDM signals","minimized EVM","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","error vector magnitude","semidefinite relaxation technique","polynomial time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error vector magnitude (EVM)","free carrier power overhead (FCPO)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","semidefinite relaxation (SDR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimized EVM via Semidefinite Relaxation","volume":"60","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6022813/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408150","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals With Minimized EVM via Semidefinite Relaxation","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2168614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097272S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6022813","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6022814,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6095462/6022814/6022814-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinyu Zhang received the B.Eng. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2007.

One critical problem in OFDMA is to assign multiple frequency bands (called subcarriers) to different users. Taking advantage of the frequency and multiuser diversities in OFDMA systems, dynamic subcarrier assignment mechanisms have been shown to achieve much higher downlink capacity than static assignment. A rich literature exists, which proposes medium-access-control- and physical-layer (MAC/PHY) schemes, aiming at exploiting the diversity gain with low implementation complexity. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer approach that explores the joint advantage of network coding and dynamic subcarrier assignment. With network coding, it becomes possible to assign the same subcarriers to different downlinks without causing interference. Consequently, our coding-aware assignment scheme improves the bandwidth efficiency and increases the downlink throughput by a substantial margin. In designing the scheme, we identify a tradeoff between diversity gain and the network coding advantage, which is critical to network performance in terms of throughput and fairness. To explore the tradeoff, we formulate the coding-aware assignment scheme as a mixed integer program and design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that can be used in practical systems. We prove the asymptotic performance bound of the algorithm and demonstrate that it closely approximates the optimum under realistic experimental settings.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2168835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06022814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2168835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","startPage":"4609","endPage":"4619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Coding-Aware Dynamic Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network-Coding-Aware Dynamic Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6022814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408151","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6022814/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Coding-Aware Dynamic Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2168835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058799S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6095462","articleId":"6022814","onlineDate":"19 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6022815,"authors":[{"name":"Hsi-Han Chiang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsi-Han","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37852528400"},{"name":"Fu-Chien Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fu-Chien","lastName":"Huang","id":"37855055300"},{"name":"Chao-Shiun Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Shiun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280032100"},{"name":"Chorng-Kuang Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chorng-Kuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280016800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"6022815","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2333},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","Gain","Broadband communication","CMOS technology","Noise","Loading","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS circuit","V-band low-noise active balun","broadband phase-correction","phase deviation","parasitic imbalance","circuit mismatch","millimeter-wave band","current-reuse pre-amplifier","low-noise amplifier","core power consumption","size 90 nm","frequency 63 GHz","gain 17.6 dB","noise figure 8.6 dB","power 19 mW","voltage 1.4 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active balun","broadband correction","gain error","low-noise amplifier","millimeter-wave (MMW)","phase correction","phase error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6022815","abstract":"This paper presents a V-band low-noise active balun with broadband phase-correction technique (PCT).

Within the low noise current-reuse pre-amplifier, this active balun circuit can be employed as low-noise amplifier as well. The measured phase error keeps less than 10 degrees from 50 GHz to 67 GHz, which demonstrates the robust calibration of phase error at MMW frequency. The measured voltage gain and noise figure at 63 GHz are 17.6 dB and 8.6 dB, respectively.

In order to improve the security of UAV landing on the flight strip, a vision-based method was presented for attitude and position estimation of it, based a few feature points distributed on the ground arbitrarily. Calculating the attitude and position relative to runway is the core. Firstly, the coordinates in the camera frame of the feature points was acquired with the N-point algorithm; secondly, with the orthogonalization method, the rotation matrix and the translation vector between the camera frame and the runway frame were acquired. For the imaging process of feature points is influenced by noise, the least-median-squares (LMS) algorithm was employed to diminish the influence of noise and to improve the robustness. For improving the efficiency of LMS, the data segmentation technology was used. The simulation indicated that the presented algorithms meet the precision demand of UAV landing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996364/6023117/06023131.pdf","startPage":"4446","endPage":"4450","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6023117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6023131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UAV attitude and position estimation for vision-based landing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Aircraft","Least squares approximation","Estimation","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft landing guidance","cameras","image segmentation","image sensors","least mean squares methods","pose estimation","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UAV attitude estimation","UAV position estimation","vision-based landing","unmanned aerial vehicle landing safety","flight strip","camera frame","N-point algorithm","orthogonalization method","rotation matrix","translation vector","imaging process","least- median-squares algorithm","data segmentation technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vision landing","N-point algorithm","orthogonalization","LMS","data segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6023131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"UAV attitude and position estimation for vision-based landing","isConference":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6023131/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269167","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UAV attitude and position estimation for vision-based landing","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"E1197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045864S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996364","isNumber":"6023117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996364","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6023117","articleId":"6023131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6023178,"authors":[{"name":"Peipei Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peipei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086662804"},{"name":"Zhou Changjun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Changjun","id":"37648971800"},{"name":"Xiong Chen","affiliation":["Pudong Branch China Mobile Group Shanghai Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086661286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-088-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-087-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-086-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6023178","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech recognition","Emotion recognition","Feature extraction","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Support vector machines","Cepstrum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","human computer interaction","speech recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic speech emotion recognition","support vector machine","SVM","human computer interaction","HCI","speaker utterances","emotional states","disgust state","boredom state","sadness state","neutral state","happiness state","Berlin emotional database","linear prediction cepstrum coefficients","Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients","energy features","pitch features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Emotion","Automatic Emotion Recognition","SVM","Energy","Pitch","LPCC","MFCC","LPCMCC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6023178","abstract":"Automatic Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a current research topic in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) with wide range of applications.

This paper proposes a robust and sensorless solution for detecting serpentine belt slip. The speed of the claw-pole alternator is directly extracted from the rectifier ripple frequency from the alternator output voltage. The estimated alternator speed is then continuously compared with the engine speed to detect possible belt slip. The proposed method is implemented in a real-time fashion on an EPGS test bench. The experimental results show that the method is able to estimate the alternator speed accurately even during fast mechanical transients. The belt-slip fault can thus be reliably detected within a wide speed range. Although originally developed for automotive alternators, the sensorless speed estimation method can be also applied to other AC generators with a DC-link rectifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024315/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024315/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12318535","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Interpolated FFT for real-time detection of belt slip in automotive electric power generation and storage system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolated FFT for real-time detection of belt slip in automotive electric power generation and storage system","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"10619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053925S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016185","isNumber":"6024314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016185","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6024314","articleId":"6024315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6024341,"authors":[{"name":"Wei He","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Wei He","id":"37087334732"},{"name":"Nicholas Williard","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Williard","id":"37712290600"},{"name":"Michael Osterman","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Osterman","id":"37275173300"},{"name":"Michael Pecht","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pecht","id":"37274594800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9827-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9828-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9826-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6024341","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Data models","Degradation","Training data","Predictive models","Mathematical model","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","inference mechanisms","lithium compounds","Monte Carlo methods","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remaining useful performance analysis","lithium-ion batteries","Dempster-Shafer theory","Bayesian Monte Carlo"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prognostics","lithium-ion batteries","Dempster-Shafer theory","Bayes updating","Monte Carlo","remaining useful performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024341","abstract":"A method for remaining useful performance (RUP) analysis for lithium-ion batteries is presented using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) and Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC).

The NAS is a highly complex dynamic system that is sensitive to aeronautical decision-making and risk management skills. In order to ensure a healthy system with safe flights a systematic approach to anomaly detection is very important when evaluating a given set of circumstances and for determination of the best possible course of action. Given the fact that the NAS is a vast and loosely integrated network of systems, it requires improved safety assurance capabilities to maintain an extremely low accident rate under increasingly dense operating conditions. Data mining based tools and techniques are required to support and aid operators' (such as pilots, management, or policy makers) overall decision-making capacity. Within the NAS, the ability to analyze fleetwide aircraft data autonomously is still considered a significantly challenging task. For our purposes a fleet is defined as a group of aircraft sharing generally compatible parameter lists. Here, in this effort, we aim at developing a system level analysis scheme. In this paper we address the capability for detection of fleetwide anomalies as they occur, which itself is an important initiative toward the safety of the real-world flight operations. The flight data recorders archive millions of data points with valuable information on flights everyday. The operational parameters consist of both continuous and discrete (binary & categorical) data from several critical sub systems and numerous complex procedures. In this paper, we discuss a system level anomaly detection approach based on the theory of kernel learning to detect potential safety anomalies in a very large data base of commercial aircraft. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach uncovers some operationally significant events due to environmental, mechanical, and human factors issues in high dimensional, multivariate Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data. We present the results of our detection algorithms on real FOQA data from a regional carrier.","doi":"10.1109/ICPHM.2011.6024356","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Prognostics and Health Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016185/6024314/06024356.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPHM.2011.6024356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fleet level anomaly detection of aviation safety data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024356/","displayDocTitle":"Fleet level anomaly detection of aviation safety data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12318576","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024356/","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fleet level anomaly detection of aviation safety data","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"10696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051713S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016185","isNumber":"6024314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016185","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6024314","articleId":"6024356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024358,"authors":[{"name":"Richard J.

To this end, computational intelligence approaches, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, and hybrid fuzzy neural networks, are increasingly being employed in the recent years. However, most of the existing approaches are based on batched learning procedure, in which all machining data are assumed to be available and can be accessed repeatedly. Such approach is impractical in the face of large data stream, and is not suitable for dynamic, time-varying tasks. In this light, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy neural network called the Bayesian Adaptive Resonance Theory (BART)-Based Fuzzy Inference System, which features a fully online learning scheme employing the BART algorithm and decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) procedure for the construction and parameter optimization of its rule base, respectively. Together, the BART and DEKF mechanisms endow the proposed system with computational efficiency and strong statistical foundation, which are desirable in modeling and prognosis tasks. To further simplify its structure, the system also incorporates a pruning procedure to remove inconsequential rules. Experimental studies on tool wear prognosis and chaotic time series prediction tasks have verified the efficacy of the proposed system as an online modeling tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024358/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12318578","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024358/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bayesian ART-based fuzzy inference system: A new approach to prognosis of machining processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian ART-based fuzzy inference system: A new approach to prognosis of machining processes","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"10700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124837S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016185","isNumber":"6024314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016185","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6024314","articleId":"6024358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6024416,"authors":[{"name":"Alphan Sahin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Alphan","lastName":"Sahin","id":"37705633700"},{"name":"Huseyin Arslan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6024416","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1492},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a new windowing method for efficient spectral shaping in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems. Unlike the conventional windowing techniques where the same windowing is used for all the subcarriers within an OFDM symbol, in the proposed approach, windowing is heavily applied to the subcarriers located at the edges of the band; shorter windowing sizes are used for the inner subcarriers compared to edge subcarriers. Instead of introducing additional windowing interval, in the proposed approach, the windowing time is stolen from the cyclic extension size. Therefore, with the proposed approach, sidelobe suppression is achieved while maintaining the spectral efficiency. The proposed technique brings about a new degree of freedom in achieving spectrally efficient sidelobe suppression and introducing controllable inter-carrier-interference (ICI) and inter-symbol-interference (ISI). This degree of freedom can be exploited with subcarrier based adaptive approaches like adaptive modulation, power control, and scheduling to improve the capacity and performance of OFDM based wireless communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6083590/06024416.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.090611.111530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.090611.111530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Windowing for OFDM Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Wireless communication","Delay","Adaptive systems","Throughput","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","power control","radiocommunication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge windowing","OFDM based system","spectral shaping","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","windowing interval","cyclic extension size","sidelobe suppression","spectral efficiency maintenance","controllable intercarrier-interference","intersymbol-interference","degree of freedom","subcarrier based adaptive approach","adaptive modulation","power control","scheduling","wireless communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","windowing","spectrum efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Edge Windowing for OFDM Based Systems","volume":"15","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6024416/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12376510","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Windowing for OFDM Based Systems","sourcePdf":"1208-cl1111-sahin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134646S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6083590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6083590","articleId":"6024416","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024417,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Duyck","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Duyck","id":"37392247900"},{"name":"Joseph J.

The results show that for a given target bit error rate, Alamouti code is preferable for a low data rate, and spatial multiplexing is preferable for a high data rate. For layered sources such as scalable video, the more important component typically has lower data rate than does the less important component. Based on these, we construct a superposition MIMO scheme where two different MIMO techniques are hierarchically combined such that important data is Alamouti coded, less important data is spatially multiplexed, and then two unequally important data symbols are superposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superposition MIMO Coding for the Broadcast of Layered Sources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.090911.100112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06024421.pdf","startPage":"3240","endPage":"3248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.090911.100112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"Superposition MIMO Coding for the Broadcast of Layered Sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6024421/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superposition MIMO Coding for the Broadcast of Layered Sources","sourcePdf":"3240-tc1112-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068477S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6024421","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6024422,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Alvarado","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden","Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6062271/6024422/6024422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Alvarado (S'06) was born in 1982 in Quenon, on the island of Chilo\u00e9 Chile.

In this paper, we give a formal explanation for these results and show that BICM-T is, in fact, the combination of a TCM transmitter and a BICM receiver. To predict the performance of BICM-T, a new type of distance spectrum for convolutional codes is introduced, analytical bounds based on this spectrum are developed, and asymptotic approximations are presented. It is shown that the free Hamming distance of the code is not the relevant optimization criterion for BICM-T. Asymptotically optimal convolutional codes for different constraint lengths are tabulated and BICM-T is shown to offer asymptotic gains of about 2 dB over traditional BICM designs based on random interleavers. The asymptotic gains over uncoded transmission are found to be the same as those obtained by Ungerboeck's one-dimensional trellis-coded modulation (1D-TCM), and therefore, in nonfading channels, BICM-T is shown to be as good as 1D-TCM.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091411.100505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/06024422.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091411.100505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On BICM Receivers for TCM Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"On BICM Receivers for TCM Transmission","volume":"59","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317761","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024422/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024422/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On BICM Receivers for TCM Transmission","sourcePdf":"2692-tc1110-alvarado.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075384S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"6024422","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6024424,"authors":[{"name":"ChiSung Bae","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"ChiSung","lastName":"Bae","id":"37086048478"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6024424","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","OFDM","Rayleigh channels","Mathematical model","Approximation algorithms","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective Nakagami-m fading","OFDM system analysis","OFDM subcarrier","fading figure matching","frequency domain channel","Nakagami-q model","Nakagami-n model","Cramer-von-Mises criterion","frequency-selective channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Nakagami-m","Channel modeling"]}],"abstract":"Abstract-We propose an approximation method for the channel impulse response of a specific OFDM subcarrier over frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading.

Among various applications, we focus on channels with known intersymbol interference, on frequency-division-multiplexed systems where adjacent signals are allowed to overlap in frequency to increase the spectral efficiency, and on code division multiple access systems. When compared with the existing interference-cancellation algorithms, the proposed schemes result very appealing in terms of tradeoff between performance and computational complexity.

The lower FG impurity concentration leads to a wider threshold-voltage distribution, which is explained by the time-dependent tunnel-oxide electric-field enhancement effect induced by the reduction of the depletion region in the FG as the programming time is lengthened. Initially, the FG is deeply depleted at the interface of the tunnel oxide. However, as the programming time is prolonged, electrons by Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling in the FG generate electron-hole pairs, and generated holes are gathered at the interface of the tunnel oxide, which reduces the depletion region, and enhance the oxide electric filed. The enhancement effect of the electric field for the tunnel oxide is coupled to the FN tunneling statistics and enlarges the distribution of the programmed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Vt</i>\n.

The modulator is sampled at 500 MHz, and features an oversampling ratio of only 10. Therefore, DAC linearization by dynamic element matching is ineffective, and the DAC nonlinearities are not corrected within the \u0394\u03a3 modulator loop but in the subsequent digital circuit. The unit element mismatches are digitally estimated based on a correlation, and correction factors are thus derived. Moreover, in order to achieve a low-power operation, all amplifiers are compensated for finite gain-bandwidth related non-idealities. In the presented work, this compensation includes the fast proportional loop, which is used to compensate for excess loop delay.

Both the full-order FE observer (FFEO) and the reduced-order FE observer (RFEO) are presented. The objective of this paper is to establish a novel framework of the FE observer with less conservatism. First, under the multiconstrained design, an FFEO is proposed to achieve FE for discrete-time T-S fuzzy models. Then, using a specific coordinate transformation, an RFEO is constructed, which results in a new fault estimator to realize FE using current output information. Furthermore, by the piecewise Lyapunov function approach, less conservative results on both FFEO and RFEO are derived by introducing slack variables. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the advantages of the theoretic results that are obtained in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Estimation Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems Based on Piecewise Lyapunov Functions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2168961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6144188/06024458.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2168961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6144188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Fault Estimation Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems Based on Piecewise Lyapunov Functions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6024458/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509224","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Estimation Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi\u2013Sugeno Fuzzy Systems Based on Piecewise Lyapunov Functions","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jiang-2168961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112448S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6144188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"6144188","articleId":"6024458","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6024470,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten Potratz","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Allgemeine Elektrotechnik (IAE), Universit\u00e4t Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Carsten Potratz photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Potratz","id":"37589858600"},{"name":"Hans-Walter Glock","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik und Elektrotechnik (IEF), Institut f\u00fcr Allgemeine Elektrotechnik (IAE), Universit\u00e4t Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Hans-Walter Glock photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Hans-Walter","lastName":"Glock","id":"37344061500"},{"name":"Ursula van Rienen","affiliation":["Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik und Elektrotechnik (IEF), Institut f\u00fcr Allgemeine Elektrotechnik (IAE), Universit\u00e4t Rostock, Rostock, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Ursula van Rienen photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ursula","lastName":"van Rienen","id":"37297138600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"6024470","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":705},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate the discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method (DG-FEM) used for the computation of electromagnetic fields in the interior of 3-D structures with open waveguide ports. This method is particularly applied to derive frequency-dependent scattering parameters. The method allows explicit formulations in time domain on unstructured meshes with high polynomial approximation order. Furthermore, it is well suited to be used in massively parallel organized computing environments. One necessary prerequisite for scattering parameter computations is the appropriate modeling of multimode broadband waveguide boundary conditions. Here we present a method of general applicability and its realization in the framework of DG-FEM. The entire procedure was implemented on low-cost graphic processing units. Two test examples are given, one of them of direct practical relevance in the field of particle accelerator design. The results are in excellent agreement with those of a commercially available frequency-domain finite-element method code.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6077122/06024470.pdf","startPage":"2788","endPage":"2797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2166163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2166163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Field and Scattering Parameter Computation in Waveguide Structures by GPU-Accelerated Discontinuous-Galerkin Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic waveguides","Time domain analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Boundary conditions","Scattering parameters","Finite element methods","Graphics processing unit","Moment methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","finite element analysis","Galerkin method","waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain field","frequency-dependent scattering parameter","waveguide structure","GPU-accelerated discontinuous-Galerkin method","discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method","DG-FEM","electromagnetic field","multimode broadband waveguide boundary condition","low-cost graphic processing unit","particle accelerator","frequency-domain finite-element method code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discontinuous Galerkin","discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method (DG-FEM)","graphic processing unit (GPU)","$S$-parameter","time domain","waveguide boundary condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Field and Scattering Parameter Computation in Waveguide Structures by GPU-Accelerated Discontinuous-Galerkin Method","volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6024470/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12357240","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Field and Scattering Parameter Computation in Waveguide Structures by GPU-Accelerated Discontinuous-Galerkin Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-potratz-2166163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064454S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6077122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6077122","articleId":"6024470","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6024471,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Merler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6130620/6024471/6024471-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Merler (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunications engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, New York, in 2008.

The semantic model vectors are extracted using a set of discriminative semantic classifiers, each being an ensemble of SVM models trained from thousands of labeled web images, for a total of 280 generic concepts. Our study reveals that the proposed semantic model vectors representation outperforms-and is complementary to-other low-level visual descriptors for video event modeling. We hence present an end-to-end video event detection system, which combines semantic model vectors with other static or dynamic visual descriptors, extracted at the frame, segment, or full clip level. We perform a comprehensive empirical study on the 2010 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection task (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/med10.cfm), which validates the semantic model vectors representation not only as the best individual descriptor, outperforming state-of-the-art global and local static features as well as spatio-temporal HOG and HOF descriptors, but also as the most compact. We also study early and late feature fusion across the various approaches, leading to a 15% performance boost and an overall system performance of 0.46 mean average precision. In order to promote further research in this direction, we made our semantic model vectors for the TRECVID MED 2010 set publicly available for the community to use (http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~mmerler/SMV.html).","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2168948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6130620/06024471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2168948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130620","startPage":"88","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Model Vectors for Complex Video Event Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Model Vectors for Complex Video Event Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471935","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6024471/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Model Vectors for Complex Video Event Recognition","sourcePdf":"tmm-merler-2168948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11338S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6130620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6130620","articleId":"6024471","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6024472,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of MillimeterWaves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/6024472/6024472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quan Xue (M'02\u2013SM'04\u2013F'11) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 1988, 1990, and 1993, respectively.","In 1993, he joined the UESTC, as a Lecturer.

The stub-loaded resonator not only has an extra degree of freedom to realize the anticipant coupling scheme, but it also can compact the circuit size and enlarge the frequency separation of the first differential- and common-mode resonant frequencies. The design procedure of the balun filter with three 50- \u03a9 ports is introduced based on a symmetric four-port balanced-to-balanced bandpass filter. Two demonstrated balun diplexers, unbalanced-to-balanced and balanced-to-unbalanced diplexers, with Rx and Tx frequencies at 1.84 and 2.45 GHz are designed, fabricated, and measured. The implemented balun diplexers present an excellent in-band balanced performance with common-mode rejection ratio better than 38 dB over the passbands.

This is designed to meet carrier needs for high-speed data and media transport as well as high-capacity voice support. The LTE PHY is a highly efficient means of conveying both data and control information between an enhanced base station and mobile user equipment. The LTE PHY employs some advanced technologies that are new to cellular applications. These include Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) data transmission. Multiple user environment in wireless communication has increased the demand for efficiency and robustness especially in low signal to noise ratio. In MIMO there is an increase in SNR of 3db on average for a two channel MRC receiver. In MIMO-OFDM ICI (inter-carrier interference) degrades the system performance. To overcome this ICI the carrier frequency synchronization algorithm for MIMO-OFDM system is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024525","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024525.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved performance by ICI Cancellation in MIMO-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024525/","displayDocTitle":"Improved performance by ICI Cancellation in MIMO-OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318742","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024525/","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved performance by ICI Cancellation in MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056475S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024528,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The subcarrier assignment is called as worst subcarrier avoiding (WSA) algorithm which is capable of avoiding allocating users the subcarriers with low channel qualities due to severe fading. WSA is low-complexity algorithm. The power-assignment is based on channel-inversion. Studies show that the attainable error performance of the FDMA systems used the WSA algorithm is the identical, irrespective of the multiplexing scheme used.

Even persons those having perfect nasal and oral cavity cannot produce sounds if they are deaf, since they cannot hear anything. If deafness is found earlier, then using speech therapist they can be made to reproduce sounds at the maximum. Depending on the degree of hearing they are deaf, profoundly deaf and hard of hearing. At the same time if deafness is found by later stage, they cannot produce sounds properly and no one can understand their speech. For analysis we have considered the deaf students whose speeches are intelligible to some extent. The characteristics of deaf speech such as pitch, formants are different from that of normal speech and due to high variability in deaf speech signal characteristics, performance of the recognition system may also degrade compared to normal speech. The uttered deaf speech is recognized using HMM with MFCC features and recognition accuracy is compared for each isolated digit. If it is extended for continuous speech then communication between deaf and normal is satisfied. Deaf speech is taken from 10 children in the age group of 5-10 years from Maharishi vidya mandir centre for deaf.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024569","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024569.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transcribing deaf and hard of hearing speech using Hidden markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024569/","displayDocTitle":"Transcribing deaf and hard of hearing speech using Hidden markov model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318786","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024569/","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transcribing deaf and hard of hearing speech using Hidden markov model","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069384S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6024574,"authors":[{"name":"P.

But, PID controllers do not work properly if plant dynamics are changing fast or when the plant is highly nonlinear. However, many of the industries still rely on it. Hence, in most of the plants an auxiliary controller coexists to help the primary PID controller to work better by compensating for uncertainties present during control operation. Neural network has proven to be a good candidate as this auxiliary nonlinear controller. Neural network can effectively compensate for unknown uncertainties and also act as an intelligent control. The success of the neural network as an auxiliary controller has been reported in practical applications such as motion control system, signal processing and controlling robot manipulators. Nowadays, parallel programmable logic devices, such as the field programmable gate array (FPGA), have become powerful hardware options, offering low cost, high execution speed, reconfigurability and parallelism. This work intends to exploit the current available resources in commercial FPGAs to implement servo control for hard disk drive system. Simulation and experimental results included in this paper show the viability of exploiting the parallelism and modularity of a Virtex 6 FPGA to implement a high sampling rate neural network-RBF based controller. This control system platform will allow fast prototyping of new control concepts and evaluation of non-linear control.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024574","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024574.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"357","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of neural network based controller using Verilog","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of neural network based controller using Verilog","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12318792","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6024574/","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of neural network based controller using Verilog","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055462S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6024577,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The key aim is to reduce the impulse noise effectively by less number of computations, less memory, less power consumption and yet achieving good visual quality of the images compared to the existing techniques. In this paper, a new intelligent low cost hardware module suitable for reduction of impulse noise is proposed. The technique which we follow here is Improved Simple Edge Preserved Denoising (ISEPD) technique with variable threshold. Simulation results show that the PSNR has improved compared to other previous techniques.

CORDIC play a major role in the calculation of the hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. CORDIC algorithm is used to evolution of wide Varity of elementary functions. The designing of CORDIC in terms of precision, number of comparisons and speed simultaneously has become a challenging problem. But its implementation in hardware requires a large increase in the cycle time. The PAR has the advantage that all the angle constants are found in parallel, in a single step, by testing only the initial rotation angle, without having to perform successive CORDIC iterations. The parallel angle recoding technique can reduce the cycle time, latency and number of comparisons in the CORDIC algorithm. This paper presents a improved PAR of CORDIC with reduced latency from 10 cycles to 7 cycles and error of the CORDIC is reduced 15% without any significant penalty on the power and area.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024602","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024602.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low latency & high precision CORDIC architecture using improved parallel angle recoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low latency & high precision CORDIC architecture using improved parallel angle recoding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12318818","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024602/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024602/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low latency & high precision CORDIC architecture using improved parallel angle recoding","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06439S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6024604,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The current dominate layered networking architecture, in which each layer is designed and operated independently, results in inefficient and inflexible resource use in wireless networks due to the nature of the wireless medium, such as time-varying channel fading. Thus, we need an integrated adaptive design across different layers. In this paper, we focus on resource allocation and scheduling in wireless multiuser OFDM networks based on joint physical and medium access control (MAC) layer optimization. An adaptive cross-layer design for the downlink multiuser OFDM systems, to maximize the weighted sum capacity of all users, where each user has multiple heterogeneous traffic queues simultaneously is proposed. A packet dependent (PD) scheduling scheme is employed at the MAC layer, which determines the packet transmission order by assigning different weights to different packets, and is shown by simulations more efficient than the previous methods where all packets in a queue have the same weight. The weight design in PD scheduling considers the delay, size and quality of service (QoS) priority level of packets. Each user weight employed in resource allocation at the physical (PHY) layer is obtained by summing up the weights of selected packets for the user. We also deeply investigate the various resource scheduling schemes for comparisons.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User based resource scheduling for heterogeneous traffic in the downlink of OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024616","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024616.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"User based resource scheduling for heterogeneous traffic in the downlink of OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024616/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318832","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User based resource scheduling for heterogeneous traffic in the downlink of OFDM systems","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097096S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024619,"authors":[{"name":"Anza Rani James","affiliation":["Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Trivandrum"],"firstName":"Anza Rani","lastName":"James","id":"37086766493"},{"name":"Revathy S Benjamin","affiliation":["Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Trivandrum"],"firstName":"Revathy S","lastName":"Benjamin","id":"37086769031"},{"name":"Shilpa John","affiliation":["Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Trivandrum"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"John","id":"37086770296"},{"name":"Treesa Mary Joseph","affiliation":["Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Trivandrum"],"firstName":"Treesa Mary","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37086771698"},{"name":"Vineetha Mathai","affiliation":["Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Trivandrum"],"firstName":"Vineetha","lastName":"Mathai","id":"37085499067"},{"name":"Sakuntala S.

The principal design problem encountered in wireless communications is how to overcome the distortion of received signals by a time-varying and frequency-selective propagation path due to the phenomenon called fading. Also, a well known problem of OFDM that is the casual occurrence of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the time domain signal reduces the efficiency of transmit high power amplifier and limits the use of OFDM in low cost applications. In this paper, we propose a closed loop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmit preprocessing system, where the channel coding method referred as pilot symbol assisted rateless coding (PSAR) is used mitigate the effects of fading and wavelet based OFDM (WOFDM) is used to reduce PAPR. In the proposed scheme wavelet is used in the place of FFT. Our rateless coding approach for mitigation of fading and reduction of peak-to average power ratio combines the error correction capability of the channel encoder and achieves peak-to-average power ratio reduction in the OFDM system. The performance of proposed system is measured with the help of three parameters, bit error rate (BER), latency and complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for PAPR The proposed system achieves about 3 dB improvement in PAPR over the traditional OFDM. The need for CP is eliminated in the system design due to the good orthogonality and time frequency localization proprieties of the wavelet. Compared with conventional FFT based OFDM, the proposed PSAR codes with WOFDM is beneficial in terms of significantly reducing PAPR and the fading effects.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024637","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","startPage":"679","endPage":"684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new MIMO-OFDM transmit preprocessing using pilot symbol assisted rateless codes to mitigate fading and wavelet based OFDM for PAPR reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new MIMO-OFDM transmit preprocessing using pilot symbol assisted rateless codes to mitigate fading and wavelet based OFDM for PAPR reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024637/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318850","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6024637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new MIMO-OFDM transmit preprocessing using pilot symbol assisted rateless codes to mitigate fading and wavelet based OFDM for PAPR reduction","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056024S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6024666,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Therefore, to provide the information about an object clinically in terms of its size and shape, image segmentation and classification are important tools in medical image processing. Ultrasound is a versatile imaging technique that can reveal the internal structure of organs, often with astounding clarity. Ultrasound is unique in its ability to image patient anatomy and physiology in real time, providing an important, rapid and non-invasive means of evaluation. Ultrasound continues to make significant contributions to patient care by reassuring patients and enhancing their quality of life by helping physicians understand their anatomy in ways not possible with other techniques. US imaging is thus one of the most commonly used auxiliary tools in clinical diagnosis. In this paper, an automatic system is developed that classifies the thyroid images and segments the thyroid gland using machine learning algorithms. The classifiers such as SVM, ELM are used. The features such as mean, variance, Coefficient of Local Variation Feature, Histogram Feature, NMSID Feature, and Homogeneity are extracted and these features are used to train the classifiers such as ELM and SVM. The results are compared with the ground truth images obtained from the radiologist and the performance measure such as accuracy is evaluated. It is observed that the segmentation using ELM is better than SVM classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024666","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016617/6024502/06024666.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thyroid classification and segmentation in ultrasound images using machine learning algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thyroid classification and segmentation in ultrasound images using machine learning algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 July 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024666/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318879","conferenceDate":"21-22 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thyroid classification and segmentation in ultrasound images using machine learning algorithms","confLoc":"Thuckalay, India","sourcePdf":"431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061615S","chronDate":"21-22 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016617","isNumber":"6024502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016617","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6024502","articleId":"6024666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6024677,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Yazdi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and IT Engineering Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Yazdi","id":"37086725883"},{"name":"Vahid Azizi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and IT Engineering Qazvin Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Azizi","id":"38581204600"},{"name":"Abolfazl T.

In the method, virtual reconstruction of crack plays an important role in providing intuitive foundations for bridge maintenance. Original crack data implies crucial information, while previous reconstruction is considered simply. In this paper, we redesign the method basing on B-spline curve optimized by using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Three steps are adopted to optimize the parameter vector and the number of control points of B-spline: (1) Build initial population model according to General Parameter Model (GPM); (2) Construct \u00b7 tness function on the basis of sum square error; (3) Discuss the probability of crossover and mutation of GA. Compared with the methods of direct point connections and least-squares fit of B-spline without optimizing, results show that the novel method can achieve satisfactory fitting curves of crack. It is helpful to analysis the state stress of concrete structure, and to predict the cracking direction. It is also proved to be feasible and to have underlying using value for bridge remote monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/ICAL.2011.6024734","startPage":"314","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics (ICAL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAL.2011.6024734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024673","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics (ICAL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6018839/6024673/06024734.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual reconstruction of crack with genetic algorithm and B-spline curve in bridge remote monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024734/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Virtual reconstruction of crack with genetic algorithm and B-spline curve in bridge remote monitoring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024734/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12271062","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual reconstruction of crack with genetic algorithm and B-spline curve in bridge remote monitoring","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"0061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048323S","chronDate":"15-16 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6018839","isNumber":"6024673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6018839","xplore-issue":"6024673","articleId":"6024734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6024769,"authors":[{"name":"Guo Jing","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086730976"},{"name":"Song Wenlong","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Wenlong","id":"37086730489"},{"name":"Jia Heming","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Heming","id":"37889239700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0302-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0301-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0300-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-816X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8151"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-8151"}],"articleNumber":"6024769","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024769","abstract":"In order to realize the contour extraction and edge detection of the images of the roots of slope protection plant, a hybrid algorithm which combined with genetic algorithm and back-propagation algorithm is presented to train a feed-forward artificial neural network (BPN).

basic image processing tasks suffer from processing overhead to operate over the whole image. In real time applications the processing time is considered as a big obstacle for its implementations. A High Performance Computing (HPC) platform is necessary in order to solve this problem. The usage of hardware accelerator make the processing time low. In recent developments, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is being used in many applications. Along with the hardware accelerator a proper choice of the computing algorithm makes it an added advantage for fast processing of images. The Cellular Neural Network (CNN) is a large-scale nonlinear analog circuit able to process signals in real time [1]. In this paper, we develop a new design in evaluation of image processing algorithms on the massively parallel GPUs with CNN implementation using Open Computing Language (OpenCL) programming model. This implementation uses the Discrete Time CNN (DT-CNN) model which is derived from originally proposed CNN model. The inherent massive parallelism of CNN along with GPUs makes it an advantage for high performance computing platform [2]. The advantage of OpenCL makes the design to be portable on all the available graphics processing devices and multi core processors. Performance evaluation is done in terms of execution time with both device (i.e. GPU) and host (i.e. CPU).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318920","htmlLink":"/document/6024781/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CNN based high performance computing for real time image processing on GPU","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CNN based high performance computing for real time image processing on GPU","confLoc":"Klagenfurt am W&#xF6;rthersee, Austria","sourcePdf":"b07PS13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068134S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6017506","isNumber":"6024774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6017506","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6024774","articleId":"6024781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6024782,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Schwarzlm\u00fcller","affiliation":["9020 Klagenfurt, Universit\u00e4tsstrasse, Austria"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Schwarzlm\u00fcller","id":"37086666720"},{"name":"Fadi Al Machot","affiliation":["9020 Klagenfurt, Universit\u00e4tsstrasse, Austria"],"firstName":"Fadi Al","lastName":"Machot","id":"37085842761"},{"name":"Alireza Fasih","affiliation":["9020 Klagenfurt, Universit\u00e4tsstrasse, Austria"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Fasih","id":"37662267300"},{"name":"Kyandoghere Kyamakya","affiliation":["9020 Klagenfurt, Universit\u00e4tsstrasse, Austria"],"firstName":"Kyandoghere","lastName":"Kyamakya","id":"37273084000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0759-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0761-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8297"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8335"}],"articleNumber":"6024782","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive contrast enhancement involving CNN-based processing for foggy weather conditions & non-uniform lighting conditions","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Joint INDS'11 & ISTET'11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6017506/6024774/06024782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Joint INDS'11 & ISTET'11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDS.2011.6024782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024774","doi":"10.1109/INDS.2011.6024782","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Meteorology","Gray-scale","Histograms","Image restoration","Equations","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","geophysics computing","image processing","meteorology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive contrast enhancement","CNN-based processing","foggy weather conditions","nonuniform lighting conditions","adaptive image processing","advanced driver assistance systems","bad weather conditions","poor vision","image contrast","airlight","scattering light","fog particles","real-time image processing","Tenengrad measure","cellular neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular Neural Network","CLAHE","weather degraded image restoration","real-time image processing","adaptive contrast enhancement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024782","abstract":"Adaptive image processing in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is a crucial issue because bad weather conditions lead to poor vision. In a foggy weather, image contrast and visibility are low due to the presence of airlight that is generated by scattering light, which in turn is caused by fog particles. Since vision based ADAS are affected by inadequate contrast, a real-time capable solution is required. To improve such degraded images, a method is required which processes each image region separately. Hence, real-time processing is required, the method is realized with the CNN paradigm which claims the characteristic of real-time image processing. To compare the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art methods the Tenengrad measure is applied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318921","htmlLink":"/document/6024782/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive contrast enhancement involving CNN-based processing for foggy weather conditions & non-uniform lighting conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive contrast enhancement involving CNN-based processing for foggy weather conditions & non-uniform lighting conditions","confLoc":"Klagenfurt am W&#xF6;rthersee, Austria","sourcePdf":"b08PS14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073931S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6017506","isNumber":"6024774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6017506","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6024774","articleId":"6024782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6024783,"authors":[{"name":"Fadi Al Machot","affiliation":["Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Fadi Al","lastName":"Machot","id":"37085842761"},{"name":"Ahmad Haj Mosa","affiliation":["Carinthia University of Applied Sciences"],"firstName":"Ahmad Haj","lastName":"Mosa","id":"37085847185"},{"name":"Kosai Dabbour","affiliation":["Carinthia University of Applied Sciences"],"firstName":"Kosai","lastName":"Dabbour","id":"37086680832"},{"name":"Alireza Fasih","affiliation":["Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Fasih","id":"37662267300"},{"name":"Christopher Schwarzlm\u00fcller","affiliation":["Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Schwarzlm\u00fcller","id":"37086666720"},{"name":"Mouhanndad Ali","affiliation":["Carinthia University of Applied Sciences"],"firstName":"Mouhanndad","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086679386"},{"name":"Kyandoghere Kyamakya","affiliation":["Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, Austria"],"firstName":"Kyandoghere","lastName":"Kyamakya","id":"37273084000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0762-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0759-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0761-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-8297"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-8335"}],"articleNumber":"6024783","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Vehicles","Speech","Speech recognition","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","audio streaming","Bayes methods","driver information systems","emotion recognition","feature extraction","road accidents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time emotion detection system","audio streams","Bayesian quadratic discriminate classifier","ADAS","advanced driver assistance systems","real-time emotion recognition concept","voice streams","traffic accidents","emotion feature extraction"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a real-time emotion recognition concept of voice streams.

Despite this fact, quite an amount of energy is wasted in todays UEs analog and digital frontends. Those are engineered for extracting the wanted signal from a spectral environment defined in the corresponding communication standards with their extremely tough requirements. In a real receiving process those requirements can typically be considered as dramatically less critical. Knowledge about the actual environmental spectral conditions allows to reconfigure both frontends to the actual needs and to save energy. In the recent past several approaches solving this issue for Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems have been discussed. The most sophisticated of those is a generic spectrum sensing technique, which we call LTE Cognitive Radio. One problem, which has to be treated in this system, is the assignment of each output in a dyadic filter bank architecture to each individual part of the observed spectrum. This paper focuses on an algorithm being able to map filter outputs to the correct part of the desired spectrum estimate.","doi":"10.1109/INDS.2011.6024807","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Joint INDS'11 & ISTET'11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6017506/6024774/06024807.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDS.2011.6024807","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Joint INDS'11 & ISTET'11","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output-to-spectrum assignment algorithm for a LTE Cognitive Radio filter bank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Output-to-spectrum assignment algorithm for a LTE Cognitive Radio filter bank","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024807/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12318946","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output-to-spectrum assignment algorithm for a LTE Cognitive Radio filter bank","confLoc":"Klagenfurt am W&#xF6;rthersee, Austria","sourcePdf":"b33SP32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044853S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6017506","isNumber":"6024774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6017506","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6024774","articleId":"6024807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024816,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Mostafa","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Mostafa","id":"37085335186"},{"name":"Werner G.

Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is often used as the method of choice for tackling this difficult problem, though MCS may also suffer from issues regarding high dimensionality leading to an increased need for computational resources. In order to address this issue an algorithmic method known as state space pruning has been developed in two flavors: Analytical and Metaheuristic based. The state space pruning methodology reduces the size of a given state space by removing states where there is no loss-of-load. This allows the MCS algorithm to sample a state space with a higher density of failure states which, in turn, leads to faster convergence. This study applies the CLONALG algorithm to the metaheuristic based version of state space pruning, compares and contrasts the results with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) implementations, and discusses its strengths and weaknesses as applied to test systems both with and without the consideration of transmission line outages.

Where the voltages are distorted, there is some conflict between power factor improvement, current harmonics mitigation, and cost issues, calling for some compromise. Min-Max constraint handling technique is used to obtain feasible solutions being in comply with IEEE-519 standards. The result is a set (not a single point) of optimal and feasible results called Pareto Front. Designer can make decision to pick out one of the results which look more suitable considering some other requirements. Using constrained multi objective optimization provides a more comprehensive design scenario giving us much more broaden view to the compensation strategy at lower computation burden. The results are also compared to those obtained from SPEA multi objective optimization approach as a well-known Multi objective optimization approach. A set of different objective functions such as current THD, power factor, distortion factor (DF), K factor, and the filter kVA are considered for optimization. The extensive simulation results of the optimization for several objective functions and constraints exhibits the suitability of the presented method.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2011.6024890","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016186/6024838/06024890.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2011.6024890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE-519 based optimal UPQC design under distorted voltages using Pareto based Min-Max constrained multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Reactive power","Active filters","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","harmonic distortion","IEEE standards","minimax techniques","Pareto optimisation","power factor","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE-519 based optimal UPQC design","distorted voltages","Pareto based min max constrained multiobjective optimization","active filtering","current harmonics mitigation","power factor improvement","compensation strategy","SPEA","current THD","distortion factor","DF","K factor","unified power quality conditioner"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Power Filters","Pareto Optimality","Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization","Distorted voltages","Harmonics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"IEEE-519 based optimal UPQC design under distorted voltages using Pareto based Min-Max constrained multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12318635","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE-519 based optimal UPQC design under distorted voltages using Pareto based Min-Max constrained multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"2079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08547S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016186","isNumber":"6024838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016186","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6024838","articleId":"6024890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024898,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen M.

Unfortunately, an AFM-based nanomanipulation system often meets the problem of low reliability and low efficiency, mainly due to the difficulty of positioning the AFM tip near the sample. In this study, a positioning control strategy is designed to accurately drive the probe to implement nanomanipulation tasks. Specifically, for an AFM piezo-scanner, a novel control strategy consisting of the following three algorithms are proposed to alleviate positioning error caused by such factors as piezo-hysteresis, cross-coupling and other uncertainties: (a) an image-based hysteresis compensation algorithm, which first obtains the voltage-displacement relationship of the hysteresis for the AFM piezo-scanner by analyzing some collected images for a calibration grating, and then utilizes this relationship to compute suitable control inputs to compensate for the positioning error caused by hysteresis nonlinearity; (b) a landmark-based positioning algorithm addressing cross-coupling effect, which first indents the sample to make regular landmarks by a series of control voltages, based on which a polynomial curve fitting method is then utilized to calculate proper inputs so that cross-coupling effect can be compensated efficiently; (c) a local scannning-based compensator, which addresses the positioning error caused by thermal drift or other uncertainties within the nanomanipulation system successfully. Some experiment results are included to show that precise nanopositioning performance can be achieved by using the presented approach.","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016074/6024900/06024937.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positioning control strategy design for AFM based nanomanipulation systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6024937/","displayDocTitle":"Positioning control strategy design for AFM based nanomanipulation systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269322","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6024937/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positioning control strategy design for AFM based nanomanipulation systems","confLoc":"Zhengzhou, China","sourcePdf":"FriM0202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070301S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016074","isNumber":"6024900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016074","xplore-issue":"6024900","articleId":"6024937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Pacilantic International Ltd","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6024952,"authors":[{"name":"I-Hsum Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Lee-Ming Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Hsum","lastName":"Li","id":"37562847700"},{"name":"Lian-Wang Lee","affiliation":["Department of Graduate School of Engineering Technology, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lian-Wang","lastName":"Lee","id":"37893152000"},{"name":"Wei-Yen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics Technology, National Taiwan Normal University"],"firstName":"Wei-Yen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085442223"},{"name":"Kai-Wei Hsu","affiliation":["Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Wei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086684026"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9555293-7-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1698-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-9555293-7-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0682"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0690"}],"articleNumber":"6024952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6024952","abstract":"An observer-based adaptive controller based on a type-2 fuzzy neural network (type-2 FNN) is developed for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonaffine nonlinear system.

The gains settings of the PI controller are tuned using the eigenvalues assignment technique. A closed formula was derived to allocate the electro-mechanical mode eigenvalues to a prescribed value. Tuning of SVC damping controllers traditionally assumes that the system loads are voltage dependent with fixed parameters. However, the load model parameters are generally uncertain. This uncertainty behavior of load model parameters can de-tune the gains of the PI controller; consequently, SVC damping controller tuned with fixed gain-settings can be adequate for some load models but contrarily can reduce system damping and contribute to system instability with loads having other models. The effect of typical load model parameters on the tuning gains of SVC PI damping controller is investigated and it is found that load models have a considerable influence on the PI controller tuning gains. The time domain simulations performed on the system show that the SVC damping controller tuned at fixed load models reduce the system damping under other load parameters and could lead to system instability.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2011.6025096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2011.6025096","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016186/6024838/06025096.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tuning of SVC proportional-integral damping controller to enhance power systems dynamic stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Tuning of SVC proportional-integral damping controller to enhance power systems dynamic stability","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025096/","accessionNumber":"12318649","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025096/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tuning of SVC proportional-integral damping controller to enhance power systems dynamic stability","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"2097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051427S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016186","isNumber":"6024838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016186","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6024838","articleId":"6025096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6025103,"authors":[{"name":"Ziang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Ziang Zhang","id":"37898828200"},{"name":"Xichun Ying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Xichun Ying","id":"38541275000"},{"name":"Mo-Yuen Chow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Mo-Yuen Chow","id":"37085363359"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0419-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0417-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0418-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6025103","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1624},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Topology","Heuristic algorithms","Convergence","Generators","Integrated circuits","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","multi-agent systems","power engineering computing","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic dispatch problem decentralization","two-level incremental cost consensus algorithm","smart grid environment","distributed control algorithm","electrical power allocation","generation unit","ICC algorithm","system power mismatch information acquisition","average consensus algorithm","multiagent system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed control","consensus","economic dispatch","multi-agent system","smart grid"]}],"abstract":"In a smart grid, effective distributed control algorithms could be embedded in distributed controllers to properly allocate electrical power among connected buses autonomously.

VSIs at voltage collapse points are difficult to predict when reactive power generation limits are taken into account in system modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes the determination of the Minimum Singular Value (MSV) and the Tangent Vector Norm (TVN) indices at the voltage collapse by means of Neural Networks (NN), being the latter a novel VSI based on the norm of the tangent vectors used in voltage collapse assessment. In order to determine voltage collapse points for different patterns of load and generation increase, an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) approach for solving the maximum loading problem was used. With these points, the MSV and TVN were calculated and used for training and testing the NNs. A small, but realistic, 6-bus system was used for carrying out this study. Results have shown that NNs can be readily applied to representing some VSIs at the voltage collapse. This approach overcomes some difficulties encountered in problems that account for system security through these VSIs.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2011.6025165","pdfPath":"/iel5/6016186/6024838/06025165.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","publicationTitle":"2011 North American Power Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2011.6025165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6024838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network representation of Voltage Stability Indices at the voltage collapse","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network representation of Voltage Stability Indices at the voltage collapse","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12318684","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025165/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network representation of Voltage Stability Indices at the voltage collapse","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"2140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115652S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016186","isNumber":"6024838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016186","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6024838","articleId":"6025165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6025172,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Kumar Chanda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Naveen Kumar Chanda received his BE degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Osmania University, India, in 2009.

However, the occurrence of faults in the shipboard power systems interrupts the power service continuity and leads to the severe damage on the electrical equipments. Faults need to be quickly detected and isolated in order to restore the power supply and prevent the massive cascading outage effect on the electrical equipments. Proper protective actions are needed to be implemented to ensure smooth and continuous operation of electric ship. This paper proposes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based method for the fault classification and location in the MVDC shipboard power systems using the transient information in the fault voltage and current waveforms. The proposed approach is applied to the cable of an equivalent MVDC system which is simulated using PSCAD. It is found to be efficient in detecting the type and location of the DC cable faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025172/","accessionNumber":"12318691","displayDocTitle":"ANN-based fault classification and location in MVDC shipboard power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN-based fault classification and location in MVDC shipboard power systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"2148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054131S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6016186","isNumber":"6024838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6016186","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6024838","articleId":"6025172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6025208,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Laugier","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Saint Ismier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5117645/6025204/6025208/6025208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Laugier is Research Director at INRIA and Scientific Leader of the e-Motion Team.

The key objective is to assess risks of collision for the ego-vehicle. We describe our concept and methods, which we have integrated and tested on our experimental platform on a Lexus car and a driving simulator. The on-board sensors deliver visual, telemetric and inertial data for environment monitoring. The sensor fusion uses our Bayesian Occupancy Filter for a spatio-temporal grid representation of the traffic scene. The underlying probabilistic approach is capable of dealing with uncertainties when modeling the environment as well as detecting and tracking dynamic objects. The collision risks are estimated as stochastic variables and are predicted for a short period ahead with the use of Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian processes. The software implementation takes advantage of our methods, which allow for parallel computation. Our tests have proven the relevance and feasibility of our approach for improving the safety of car driving.","doi":"10.1109/MITS.2011.942779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5117645/6025204/06025208.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MITS.2011.942779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of Dynamic Scenes and Collision Risks Assessment to Improve Driving Safety","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2011","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Analysis of Dynamic Scenes and Collision Risks Assessment to Improve Driving Safety","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025208/","publicationDate":"winter 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12318298","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025208/","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Analysis of Dynamic Scenes and Collision Risks Assessment to Improve Driving Safety","sourcePdf":"03mits04-laugier.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088008S","chronDate":"winter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5117645","isNumber":"6025204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5117645","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6025204","articleId":"6025208","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6025217,"authors":[{"name":"Somnath Paul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6069922/6025217/6025217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Somnath Paul (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2005.

However, their intrinsic flexibility comes at the cost of significantly worse performance and power dissipation than their custom counterparts. Existing design solutions such as voltage scaling and multi-threshold assignment typically trade off energy for performance or vise versa. In this paper, we show that an integrated circuit-architecture-software co-design approach can be extremely effective to simultaneously improve the power and performance of a reconfigurable hardware framework, leading to large improvement in energy-delay product (EDP). First, we select a spatio-temporal reconfigurable computing architecture based on 2-threshold assignment-D memory-array. Applications are mapped to memory as multiple-input multiple-output lookup tables (LUTs) and are evaluated in temporal manner inside a computing element. Multiple such computing elements communicate spatially through programmable interconnects. Next, we exploit the read-dominant memory access pattern in reconfigurable hardware to design an asymmetric memory cell, which provides higher read performance and lower read power leading to improvement in the overall EDP during operation. We note that the proposed memory cell is also asymmetric in terms of its content, providing better read power for one of the logic states (logic \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d). Based on this observation, next we propose a content-aware application mapping approach, which tries to maximize the logic \u201c0\u201d or logic \u201c1\u201d content in the lookup tables. A design flow is presented to incorporate the proposed architecture, asymmetric memory cell design and content-aware mapping. We show that for both nanoscale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) [static random access memory (SRAM)] as well as emerging non-CMOS [spin torque transfer random access memory (STTRAM)] memory technologies, such a co-design solution can achieve significant improvement in system EDP over a conventional FPGA framework.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2165232","startPage":"369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6069922/06025217.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2165232","endPage":"380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Computing Using a Circuit-Architecture-Software Co-Design Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Computing Using a Circuit-Architecture-Software Co-Design Approach","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6025217/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12331857","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Computing Using a Circuit-Architecture-Software Co-Design Approach","sourcePdf":"jetcas-paul-2165232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081704S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"6025217","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025219,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Sik Kim","affiliation":["DRAM Design Team, Samsung Electronics, Company, Ltd., Hwasung-city, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6109882/6025219/6025219-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jung-Sik Kim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996, 1998, and 2003, respectively.","His research was mainly focused on short channel effects in MOS transistors and noise in semiconductor devices.

With the increase in the significance of process variation, higher performance requirements reduce the allowable design margin in DRAM circuits. However, self-dynamic voltage scaling gives a greater timing margin in the circuitry by changing the internal supply voltage in response to the operating frequency and process skew. By changing the internal supply voltage, the life time of the chip increases by more than 23 times when the supply voltage is lowered by 300 mV. The proposed adaptive design techniques include an adaptive bandwidth delay-locked loop and an adaptive clock gating. The former improves the performance by obtaining a wider valid data window and the latter saves on dynamic power consumption in the clock distribution network. The SDVS method reduces the IDD3P by 9.3% and the adaptive clock gating saves 8.8% of the IDD3N when measured at 200 MHz, 25\u00b0C The studied consumer DDR2 SDRAM was fabricated using 44 nm standard DRAM process technology.

The advantage of the former is that it is simpler to implement for digital circuits as it needs the half-size inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform. As will be shown, there are synchronization errors, such as carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling frequency offset (SFO) that degrade the performance of passband transmission. On the other hand, baseband transmission is expected to be less complex in an analog circuit implementation and to be affected by only SFO, since it does not need up-down conversion. Both CFO and SFO are caused by the frequency errors of the reference clocks in the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios and capacities are considered in comparing the effects of synchronization errors in passband and baseband transmissions. The results indicate that the performance degradation of passband transmission is almost the same as that of baseband transmission in the presence of synchronization errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06025239.pdf","startPage":"2466","endPage":"2475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2164946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2164946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Passband and Baseband Transmission Schemes for Power-Line Communication OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Passband","Baseband","Channel capacity","Power line communications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","clocks","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM systems","power-line communication","passband transmission","baseband transmission","digital circuits","half-size inverse fast Fourier transform","synchronization errors","carrier frequency offset","sampling frequency offset","analog circuit","reference clocks","transmitter","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baseband transmission","carrier frequency offset","channel capacity","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","passband transmission","sampling frequency offset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Passband and Baseband Transmission Schemes for Power-Line Communication OFDM Systems","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6025239/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288247","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Passband and Baseband Transmission Schemes for Power-Line Communication OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-lee-2164946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066896S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6025239","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025242,"authors":[{"name":"Steven D.

Changes in the frequency response of a transformer can be potential indicators of winding deformation as well as other structural and electrical problems. A diagnostic tool which leverages this knowledge in order to detect such changes is frequency-response analysis (FRA). To date, FRA has been used to identify changes in a transformer's frequency response but with limited insight into the underlying cause of the change. However, there is now a growing research interest in specifically identifying the structural change in a transformer directly from its FRA signature. The aim of this paper is to support FRA interpretation through the development of wideband three-phase transformer models which are based on three types of FRA tests. The resulting models can be used as a flexible test bed for parameter sensitivity analysis, leading to greater insight into the effects that geometric change can have on transformer FRA. This paper will demonstrate the applicability of this modeling approach by simultaneously fitting each model to the corresponding FRA data sets without a priori knowledge of the transformer's internal dimensions, and then quantitatively assessing the accuracy of key model parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2164424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06025242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2164424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Power Transformers to Support the Interpretation of Frequency-Response Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Power Transformers to Support the Interpretation of Frequency-Response Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288248","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025242/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Power Transformers to Support the Interpretation of Frequency-Response Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-mitchell-2164424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083478S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6025242","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025245,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Saber Tehrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6069495/6025245/6025245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Saber Tehrani received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2001 and the M.Sc. degree in communication systems from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany, in 2008.

However, in the presence of noise this type of decoding can magnify errors, particularly when packet sizes are large. We show that ZigZag decoding can be seen as an instance of belief propagation in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limit. Building on this observation, we present a simple soft-decoding version, called SigSag, that improves performance. We show that for two users, collisions result in a cycle-free factor graph that can be optimally decoded via belief propagation. For collisions between more than two users, we show that if a simple bit-permutation is used then the graph is locally tree-like with high probability, and hence belief propagation is near-optimal. Further, we introduce the joint channel-collision decoding which decodes the collided packets while the packets are coded by an LDPC code. Through simulations we show that our scheme performs better than coordinated collision-free time division multiple access (TDMA) and the ZigZag decoder. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the joint channel-collision decoder in different scenarios and show that it performs better than TDMA and ZigZag decoder accompanied by sum-product decoding.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/06025245.pdf","startPage":"1512","endPage":"1523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SigSag: Iterative Detection Through Soft Message-Passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025245/","displayDocTitle":"SigSag: Iterative Detection Through Soft Message-Passing","volume":"5","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025245/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SigSag: Iterative Detection Through Soft Message-Passing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-sabertehrani-2169042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0656S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6025245","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025247,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Schniter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6069495/6025247/6025247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Philip Schniter received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, in 2000.","From 1993 to 1996, he was with Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR, as a Systems Engineer, and in 2000.

As a way to facilitate image categorization and retrieval, automatic image annotation has received much research attention. Considering that there are a great number of unlabeled images available, it is beneficial to develop an effective mechanism to leverage unlabeled images for large-scale image annotation. Meanwhile, a single image is usually associated with multiple labels, which are inherently correlated to each other. A straightforward method of image annotation is to decompose the problem into multiple independent single-label problems, but this ignores the underlying correlations among different labels. In this paper, we propose a new inductive algorithm for image annotation by integrating label correlation mining and visual similarity mining into a joint framework. We first construct a graph model according to image visual features. A multilabel classifier is then trained by simultaneously uncovering the shared structure common to different labels and the visual graph embedded label prediction matrix for image annotation. We show that the globally optimal solution of the proposed framework can be obtained by performing generalized eigen-decomposition. We apply the proposed framework to both web image annotation and personal album labeling using the NUS-WIDE, MSRA MM 2.0, and Kodak image data sets, and the AUC evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on large-scale image databases collected from the web and personal album show that the proposed algorithm is capable of utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data for image annotation and outperforms other algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2169269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06025297.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1351","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2169269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web and Personal Image Annotation by Mining Label Correlation With Relaxed Visual Graph Embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Web and Personal Image Annotation by Mining Label Correlation With Relaxed Visual Graph Embedding","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6025297/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537618","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","pubMedId":"21947528","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025297/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web and Personal Image Annotation by Mining Label Correlation With Relaxed Visual Graph Embedding","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2169269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6025297","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6025302,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Shao","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6130620/6025302/6025302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Shao received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively, all in electronic science and technology.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.

Distortions in depth map may induce geometry changes in the virtual views, and distortions in texture video may be propagated to the virtual views. Thus, effective compression of both texture videos and depth maps is important for 3-D video system. From the perspective of bit allocation, asymmetric coding of the texture videos and depth maps is an effective way to get the optimal solution of 3-D video compression and view rendering problems. In this paper, a novel asymmetric coding method of multi-view video plus depth (MVD) based 3-D video is proposed on purpose of providing high-quality view rendering. In the proposed method, two models are proposed to characterize view rendering distortion and binocular suppression in 3-D video. Then, an asymmetric coding method of MVD-based 3-D video is proposed by combining two models in encoding framework. Finally, a chrominance reconstruction algorithm is presented to achieve accurate reconstruction. Experimental results show that compared with other methods, the proposed method can obtain higher performance of view rendering under the total bitrate constraint. Moreover, the perceptual visual quality of 3-D video is almost unaffected with the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6130620/06025302.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2169045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2169045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Coding of Multi-View Video Plus Depth Based 3-D Video for View Rendering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Encoding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Bit rate","Visualization","Materials","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","rendering (computer graphics)","signal reconstruction","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric coding","depth-image-based rendering","virtual view","depth map distortion","geometry change","texture video","3D video system","bit allocation","3D video compression","multiview video plus depth based 3D video","view rendering distortion","binocular suppression","encoding framework","chrominance reconstruction algorithm","bitrate constraint","perceptual visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D video","asymmetric coding","bit allocation","chrominance reconstruction","view rendering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Coding of Multi-View Video Plus Depth Based 3-D Video for View Rendering","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6025302/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471938","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Coding of Multi-View Video Plus Depth Based 3-D Video for View Rendering","sourcePdf":"tmm-shao-2169045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09476S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6130620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6130620","articleId":"6025302","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025304,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Karimi Ghartemani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6025304/6025304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masoud Karimi Ghartemani (M'01--SM'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering in 1993 and 1995, respectively, from Isfahan University of Technology, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Toronto, Canada, in 2004.","He was a faculty member at Sharif University of Technology, Iran, from 2005 to 2008, and a postdoctoral and visiting researcher at Queens University, Canada, from 2008 to 2011.

Correlatively, it offers soft startup stage and avoids undesired frequency swings caused by phase jumps. The adaptive mechanism adjusts the gain of frequency estimation loop in order to mitigate large transients of frequency during sudden phase angle variations. This reduces the coupling of phase and frequency variables and allows tremendously faster and smoother estimation of both variables. The proposed adaptive mechanism can be applied to different PLL and adaptive notch-filter systems three of which including the enhanced PLL (EPLL), the synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL), and the second order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop (SOGI-FLL) are studied in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12543558","htmlLink":"/document/6025304/","displayDocTitle":"Problems of Startup and Phase Jumps in PLL Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problems of Startup and Phase Jumps in PLL Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-karimighartemani-2169089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050345S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6025304","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6025305,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Magne","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electronique et en Electrotechnique de Nancy (GREEN), INPL, University of Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6025305/6025305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pierre Magne (S\u201911) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL), Nancy, France, in 2009, and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Electricit\u00e9 et de M\u00e9canique (ENSEM), Nancy, France, in 2009.

In such applications, small and light systems are required and so optimization of passive elements, such as dc-bus capacitance and filtering inductance, is an important issue. It is known that the reduction of dc-bus capacitance may lead to instability of an MVdc network. So, if no stabilizer is used, the risk of instability must be considered, while designing the system passive elements. In this paper, we will first study the small signal stability of an MVdc network composed of three loads: an inverter supplying a permanent magnet synchronous motor, a dc/dc converter feeding a resistive load, and a supercapacitor controlled by a bidirectional dc/dc converter. Then, we will propose a large-signal-stabilizing system to ensure global stability by generating proper stabilizing power references for the whole system. The contribution of the loads to network stability is adjustable. The validity of the proposed method will be confirmed by experimentations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06025305.pdf","startPage":"1788","endPage":"1798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Active Global Stabilization of Multiloads DC-Power Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Power system stability","Asymptotic stability","Numerical stability","Control systems","Capacitors","Electrostatic discharge"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft power systems","invertors","permanent magnet motors","power system stability","supercapacitors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general active global stabilization","multiloads DC-power networks","more electric aircraft","MEA","dc-bus capacitance","filtering inductance","system passive elements","inverter","permanent magnet synchronous motor","supercapacitor","bidirectional dc/dc converter","large-signal-stabilizing system","network stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC drives","active stabilization","constant power load (CPL)","dc-power network","energy storage device (ESD)","fault-tolerant control","Lyapunov methods","more electric aircraft (MEA)","MVdc networks","nonlinear systems","power electronics systems","power system stability","stability","supercapacitor (SC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"General Active Global Stabilization of Multiloads DC-Power Networks","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6025305/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543559","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Active Global Stabilization of Multiloads DC-Power Networks","sourcePdf":"tpel-magne-2168426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077191S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6025305","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025310,"authors":[{"name":"Qinmin Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Department of Control Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qinmin Yang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri, Rolla, in 2007.","From 2007 to 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the University of Missouri.

The proposed controller design has two entities, an action network that is designed to produce optimal signal and a critic network that evaluates the performance of the action network. The critic estimates the cost-to-go function which is tuned online using recursive equations derived from heuristic dynamic programming. Here, neural networks (NNs) are used both for the action and critic whereas any OLAs, such as radial basis functions, splines, fuzzy logic, etc., can be utilized. For the output-feedback counterpart, an additional NN is designated as the observer to estimate the unavailable system states, and thus, separation principle is not required. The NN weight tuning laws for the controller schemes are also derived while ensuring uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system using Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the two controllers is tested in simulation on a pendulum balancing system and a two-link robotic arm system.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2166384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6169194/06025310.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2166384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems using Online Approximators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems using Online Approximators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025310/","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12592475","pubMedId":"21947529","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025310/","volume":"42","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems using Online Approximators","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-yang-2166384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118906S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6169194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6169194","articleId":"6025310","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6025311,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Amini","affiliation":["Advanced Communication Research Institute (ACRI), Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6025311/6025311-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Amini received the B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering (communications and signal processing) in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively, and the B.Sc. degree in petroleum engineering (reservoir) in 2005, all from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Tehran, Iran.","Since April 2011, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.

Unlike previous works on cooperative systems in which a number of subcarriers are solely occupied by pilots, partial data-dependent superimposed training (PDDST) is considered here, thus preserving the spectral efficiency. First, a closed-form channel estimator is developed based on the least squares (LS) method with Tikhonov regularization and a corresponding data detection algorithm is proposed using the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) criterion. In the derived channel estimator, the unknown data is treated as part of the noise and the resulting data detection may not meet the required performance. To address this issue, an iterative method based on the variational inference approach is derived to improve performance. Simulation results show that the data detection performance of the proposed iterative algorithm initialized by the LMMSE data detector is close to the ideal case with perfect channel state information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superimposed Training-Based Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems Under High Mobility","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06025313.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Superimposed Training-Based Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems Under High Mobility","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6025313/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425222","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superimposed Training-Based Channel Estimation and Data Detection for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Systems Under High Mobility","sourcePdf":"tsp-he-2169059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086629S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6025313","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025314,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Khoshnevis","affiliation":["Edward S.

A multiple-antenna base-station is assumed to serve multiple single-antenna users, who quantize and feed back their channel state information (CSI) through a shared rate-limited feedback channel. The optimization problem is cast in the form of minimizing the average transmission power at the base-station subject to users' target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) and outage probability constraints. The goal is to derive the feedback bit allocations among the users and the corresponding channel magnitude and direction quantization codebooks in a high-resolution quantization regime. Toward this end, this paper develops an optimization framework using approximate analytical closed-form solutions, the accuracy of which is then verified by numerical results. The results show that, for channels in the real space, the number of channel direction quantization bits should be (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-1) times the number of channel magnitude quantization bits, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n is the number of base-station antennas. Moreover, users with higher requested quality-of-service (QoS), i.e., lower target outage probabilities, and higher requested downlink rates, i.e., higher target SINR's, should use larger shares of the feedback rate. It is also shown that, for the target QoS parameters to be feasible, the total feedback bandwidth should scale logarithmically with the geometric mean of the target SINR values and the geometric mean of the inverse target outage probabilities. In particular, the minimum required feedback rate is shown to increase if the users' target parameters deviate from the corresponding geometric means. Finally, the paper shows that, as the total number of feedback bits \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n increases, the performance of the limited-feedback system approaches the perfect-CSI system as 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup>\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06025314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","startPage":"367","endPage":"382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Allocation Laws for Multiantenna Channel Feedback Quantization: Multiuser Case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit Allocation Laws for Multiantenna Channel Feedback Quantization: Multiuser Case","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425223","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Allocation Laws for Multiantenna Channel Feedback Quantization: Multiuser Case","sourcePdf":"tsp-khoshnevis-2169250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198588S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6025314","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6025315,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Gokceoglu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6104236/6025315/6025315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmet Gokceoglu (S'11) was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1986.

Among various linearization methods, the feedforward linearization technique is a fairly established principle offering a good tradeoff between linearity and power-efficiency even under wideband operation. Moreover, adaptive techniques for such linearizer have been proposed in literature to track parameter changes in the main PA and other circuitry. Among those, least mean squares (LMS) method for adapting signal cancellation loop (SCL) and error cancellation loop (ECL) coefficients is an attractive low-complexity alternative. In this paper, we carry out extensive closed-form performance analysis of the achievable intermodulation distortion (IMD) reduction of the overall LMS-adaptive feedforward linearizer, as a function of the used step-sizes and essential waveform statistics. Such analysis is currently missing from the state-of-the-art literature. Both memoryless nonlinearities and Wiener-Hammerstein type PA memory models are studied for which IMD suppression expressions are derived. Comprehensive computer simulations are also provided to illustrate the accuracy of the analysis when practical OFDM waveforms are used. Design examples are given as well where the analysis results are used to choose proper linearizer step-sizes to meet given transmitter spectral mask specifications.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169254","startPage":"82","endPage":"99","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06025315.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-State Performance Analysis and Step-Size Selection for LMS-Adaptive Wideband Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Steady-State Performance Analysis and Step-Size Selection for LMS-Adaptive Wideband Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025315/","accessionNumber":"12425224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025315/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-State Performance Analysis and Step-Size Selection for LMS-Adaptive Wideband Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","sourcePdf":"tsp-valkama-2169254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092608S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6025315","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6025317,"authors":[{"name":"Xiufeng Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6025317/6025317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiufeng Song (S'08) received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2008, both in electrical engineering.

As green radio (GR) becomes an inevitable trend, energy-efficient design is becoming more and more important. In this paper, the fundamental tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and SE in downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks is addressed. We first set up a general EE-SE tradeoff framework, where the overall EE, SE and per-user quality-of-service (QoS) are all considered, and prove that under this framework, EE is strictly quasiconcave in SE. We then discuss some basic properties, such as the impact of channel power gain and circuit power on the EE-SE relation. We also find a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound on the EE-SE curve for general scenarios, which reflect the actual EE-SE relation. We then focus on a special case that priority and fairness are considered and suggest an alternative upper bound, which is proved to be achievable for flat fading channels. We also develop a low-complexity but near-optimal resource allocation algorithm for practical application of the EE-SE tradeoff.

While contention-based MAC protocols such as CSMA experience significant performance degradation under high contention levels, slot-based MAC protocols such as TDMA perform in the opposite way. In this paper, we propose a hybrid MAC protocol to which we refer as Load-Adaptive MAC (LA-MAC) protocol for MANETs formed by a collection of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) equipped nodes. By adaptively switching its mode of operation between CSMA and TDMA, LA-MAC achieves a high channel utilization and a reasonable delay profile under both high and low contention levels identified by the measured collision rate of the MAC frames. As a cross-layer protocol, LA-MAC relies on the information received from the physical layer in order to distinguish between corrupted frames due to actual collisions as opposed to those corrupted by wireless link effects such as fading. We describe the design of LA-MAC protocol and report on its implementation in a MANET testbed formed by a collection of MIMO Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software Defined Radio (SDR) nodes. Through analytical and experimental studies, we compare the performance of LA-MAC with that of CSMA and TDMA under different traffic conditions. The results show the improvements achieved by LA-MAC in comparison with other alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06025329.pdf","startPage":"3924","endPage":"3933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.110297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.110297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Adaptive MAC: A Hybrid MAC Protocol for MIMO SDR MANETs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Mobile computing","Ad hoc networks","Synchronization","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","MIMO communication","mobile ad hoc networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio","cross layer protocol","collision rate","reasonable delay profile","high channel utilization","TDMA","CSMA","MIMO SDR MANET","hybrid MAC protocol","load adaptive MAC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDR","USRP","GNU radio","MANET","MIMO","CSMA","TDMA","hybrid MAC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Load Adaptive MAC: A Hybrid MAC Protocol for MIMO SDR MANETs","volume":"10","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6025329/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391204","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Adaptive MAC: A Hybrid MAC Protocol for MIMO SDR MANETs","sourcePdf":"3924-tw1111-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046977S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6025329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6025331,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6025331/6025331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from McMaster University in July 2011, all in electrical and computer engineering.

In this paper we study QoS provisioning in an ad hoc CRN with spectrum underlay. Both streaming traffic and non-real-time (nrt) data traffic are considered. The former requires a low session outage probability and the latter requires a minimum average throughput. A joint connection admission and packet scheduling scheme is proposed in this paper. The connection admission control scheme limits the amount of traffic admitted into the system so that all admitted connections can receive their required QoS through the proposed packet scheduling schemes. Two packet transmission scheduling schemes are designed, one is optimum and assumes that a central controller can collect the global channel and interference conditions within the CRN and between the primary network and the CRN, while the other one is a heuristic scheme based on the link and interference conditions measured by the nodes in the CRN. In addition to achieving the required QoS, the scheduling schemes utilize the available radio resources fairly and efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that when the traffic load at the primary network is relatively stationary, the proposed scheduling scheme can achieve very low and fair outage probability for all admitted streaming connections, and all admitted non-real-time data connections can receive the required throughput and fair delay performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12391206","htmlLink":"/document/6025331/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Connection Admission Control and Packet Scheduling in a Cognitive Radio Network with Spectrum Underlay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Connection Admission Control and Packet Scheduling in a Cognitive Radio Network with Spectrum Underlay","sourcePdf":"3852-tw1111-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08018S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6025331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6025332,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In contrast to previous proposals that used the channel correlation matrix (CCM) and its eigendecomposition, this paper shows that close linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE) performance can be achieved with the use of predefined bases derived from the knowledge of the maximum angular dispersion. A theoretical framework to synthesize a suitable set of bases is provided, from which discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSSs) are identified as one of the appropriate predefined bases for spatial channel representation. The robustness of the proposed estimator allows changes in the propagation scenario to be managed according to the demands of realistic communications systems. The performance analysis of the channel estimator is shown and corroborated with simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.101199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06025332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.101199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","startPage":"3711","endPage":"3719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Correlated MIMO Channels using Partial Channel State Information and DPSS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Correlated MIMO Channels using Partial Channel State Information and DPSS","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391207","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Correlated MIMO Channels using Partial Channel State Information and DPSS","sourcePdf":"3711-tw1111-gandara.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087672S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6025332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6025333,"authors":[{"name":"Pierluigi Salvo Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway","Department of Information Engineering, Second University of Naples, Aversa, Caserta, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Salvo Rossi","id":"37271856800"},{"name":"Ghassan M.

Each source and destination is equipped with one antenna and the communication is assisted by a multi-antenna relay operating in Amplify-and-Forward fashion. The communication occurs in two slots; in the first slot, the sources transmit simultaneously, and in the second slot, the relay retransmits the signals which were received by its antennas during the first slot, after linearly processing them via a Zeroforcing Beamforming (ZFBF) matrix. Two different designs for the ZFBF matrix are proposed. The first design allocates the relay power so that all data streams have the same useful power. The second design adjusts the relay weights for all S-D pairs in a way that maximizes the sumrate. It is shown analytically that, when the source or relay power is high, the proposed sumrate maximization method has the same ergodic sumrate as the cut-set bound with two identical slots and a ZF precoder in the broadcast hop or a ZF equalizer in the multiple access hop, or maintains a constant gap from the cut-set bound with a ZF precoder in the broadcast hop. Although initially perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed available at the relay, an upper bound of the ergodic sumrate loss caused by relay CSI errors is also derived.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.101523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06025358.pdf","startPage":"3732","endPage":"3742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.091411.101523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Sumrate of Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks with Multiple Source-Destination Pairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025358/","displayDocTitle":"On the Sumrate of Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks with Multiple Source-Destination Pairs","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391211","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025358/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sumrate of Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks with Multiple Source-Destination Pairs","sourcePdf":"3732-tw1111-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100537S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6025358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6025364,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Martin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Centre for Power Transformer Monitoring Diagnostics and Life Management (the transformerLIFE Centre) Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/57/6025359/6025364/6025364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Martin received the BEng degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Brighton, UK, in 2000 (with study abroad in Germany).

The concentration of water dissolved in the oil was initially around 15 ppm, increased to 25 ppm, and then decreased to 15 ppm over a period of two years. These levels are higher than the levels expected in mineral oil because of the higher hygroscopy of vegetable oil. Ethane was found in a nominally identical transformer that had not been used for two years. This observation supports the hypothesis proposed in previous work that ethane can be generated in FR3 fluid even under no-fault conditions. In the operating transformer the ethane concentration increased during the first month of energization and then decreased to a constant value. The DDF did not vary significantly between oil samples taken from the operating transformer.

The experimental results show that the immune genetic algorithm based on chaos theory can search the result of the optimization and evidently improve the convergent speed and astringency.","doi":"10.1109/MEC.2011.6025670","pdfPath":"/iel5/6020827/6025381/06025670.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1150","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEC.2011.6025670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved chaos immune genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An improved chaos immune genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12327439","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6025670/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved chaos immune genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Jilin, China","sourcePdf":"0114700069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056894S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6020827","isNumber":"6025381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6020827","xplore-issue":"6025381","articleId":"6025670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6025715,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Hongmin","affiliation":["Merchant Marine College, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Hongmin","id":"37403589900"},{"name":"Tu Shuping","affiliation":["Merchant Marine College, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tu","lastName":"Shuping","id":"37086660244"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-722-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-721-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6025715","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025715","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature control","Energy consumption","Atmospheric modeling","Artificial neural networks","Marine vehicles","Mathematical model","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","energy consumption","feedback","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy saving analysis","neural network control","ship air conditioning system","air conditioned cabins","thermal environment","predicted mean vote","energy consumption","temperature feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network control air-conditioning","PMV","ship cabin"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MEC.2011.6025715","pdfPath":"/iel5/6020827/6025381/06025715.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEC.2011.6025715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-saving analysis of neural network control based on PMV in a ship air conditioning system","abstract":"In this paper, the design of neural network approach is developed aiming at the control of the indoor thermal comfort in air-conditioned cabins.

The problem of our concern is: given a CR ad hoc network and a QoS group communication request, how to set up a communication connection so that the total bandwidth consumption of the communication is minimized while the QoS requirement is met. In this paper, we focus on the bandwidth requirement. We propose a core based bottom up (CBBU) method to solve the problem. In this method, we consider the communication routing together with slot assignment. In order to avoid getting a very long routing tree, all nodes in the network are layered first in the method. Extensive simulations show that our proposed method performs well in reducing the total bandwidth consumption of the communication.","doi":"10.1109/MEC.2011.6025870","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6020827/6025381/06025870.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEC.2011.6025870","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Mechatronic Science, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC)","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS routing algorithm for group communications in Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A QoS routing algorithm for group communications in Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025870/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12339783","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS routing algorithm for group communications in Cognitive Radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Jilin, China","sourcePdf":"0195300674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094193S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6020827","isNumber":"6025381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6020827","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6025381","articleId":"6025870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6025902,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabin You","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jiabin","lastName":"You","id":"37086669333"},{"name":"Shaochuan Wu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shaochuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086669222"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-722-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-721-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6025902","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6025902","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Polynomials","Decoding","Computer architecture","Codecs","Reed-Solomon codes","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","Reed-Muller codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codec","FPGA technique","image transmission system","pipelined decoder","RS 255 decoder","RS 223 decoder","Berlekamp-Massey linear feedback shift register algorithm","LFSR algorithm","Signal Tap II software","Cyclone II FPGA","bit rate 960 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RS codec","RS decoder","Simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a design and realization of RS(255, 223) codec targeted for an image transmission system.

scattered genetic algorithm with interior point method","abstract":"While using genetic algorithm to solve constrained optimization problems, some of its shortcomings appear such as difficulty in obtaining feasible individuals in many strong constraint conditions and poor local search ability. In this paper, an algorithmic thought of constraints scattering is presented to divide the complete constraints of a problem into several sub-populations for processing, which effectively improves the global search ability of the new algorithm. Experiments show that with this operation population can achieve better performance, which means containing more feasible solutions with larger feasible solution diversity, can be generated during the iteration of genetic algorithm. Then further combined with the interior point method, a new hybrid constraints scattered genetic algorithm with interior point method (CSGA-I) is proposed to ensure the local search ability while searching the whole feasible region. Experiments and comparisons over a set of standard test functions demonstrate that our approach has a better solution precision at less computation cost than most of the other algorithm reported in literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6025984/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12339897","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6025984/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid constraints scattered genetic algorithm with interior point method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid constraints scattered genetic algorithm with interior point method","confLoc":"Jilin, China","sourcePdf":"0243400957.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074819S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6020827","isNumber":"6025381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6020827","xplore-issue":"6025381","articleId":"6025984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6026007,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Xiang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Techology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37086647157"},{"name":"Desheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Power Engineering, Henan Polytechnic Universitye, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Desheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086644972"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-722-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-721-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6026007","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Training","Biological cells","Logic gates","Fault diagnosis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence","fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","machine bearings","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent fault diagnosis","BP neural network","convergence","real-number coded double chain quantum genetic algorithm","bearing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","Quantum genetic algorithm","Real-number coded double-chain quantum genetic algorithm","the Intelligent fault diagnosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026007","abstract":"Aiming at the defects of BP neural network, analyzed the disadvantages of the genetic algorithm and the common quantum genetic algorithm.

Since the complexity of the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas, various suboptimal detectors are proposed to exploit the tradeoff between complexity and performance. Among them, the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-soft cancellation (SC) detector has an excellent tradeoff. In this paper, by noting that the MMSE-SC detector is an approximate MAP detector, another approximate MAP detector that uses successive processing is proposed. The proposed successive detector can provide a better performance than the MMSE-SC detector, while its complexity is comparable with that of the MMSE-SC detector. An interesting feature of the proposed successive detector is that the tradeoff between complexity and performance can be exploited by a single parameter, which could be an important control parameter in practical implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/06026218.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate MAP Detection With Ordering and Successive Processing for Iterative Detection and Decoding in MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Receivers","Complexity theory","Iterative decoding","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate MAP detection","MIMO system","iterative detection and decoding","IDD","multiple-input multiple-output system","maximum a posteriori probability detector","MAP detector","transmitting antenna","suboptimal detector","minimum mean square error-soft cancellation detector","MMSE-soft SC detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative detection and decoding (IDD)","${\\rm M}$-algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","soft detection","successive detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Approximate MAP Detection With Ordering and Successive Processing for Iterative Detection and Decoding in MIMO Systems","volume":"5","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6026218/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360024","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate MAP Detection With Ordering and Successive Processing for Iterative Detection and Decoding in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-choi-2169391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114217S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6026218","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026222,"authors":[{"name":"Jucheng Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6079221/6026222/6026222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jucheng Yang received the B.S. degree from the South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Chonbuk National University, Jeonbuk, Korea, and the Post-Doctorate degree from the Advanced Graduate Education Center of Jeonbuk for Electronics and Information Technology-BK21, Jeonbuk.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Information Technology, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.

Fingerprint recognition is one of the popular and effective approaches for priori authorizing the users and protecting the information elements during the communications. However, traditional fingerprint recognition approaches have demerits of easy losing rich information and poor performances due to the complex inputs, such as image rotation, incomplete input image, poor quality image enrollment, and so on. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, a new fingerprint recognition scheme based on a set of assembled invariant moment (geometric moment and Zernike moment) features to ensure the secure communications is proposed. And the proposed scheme is also based on an effective preprocessing, the extraction of local and global features and a powerful classification tool, thus it is able to handle the various input conditions encountered in the cloud computing communication. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher matching accuracy comparing with traditional or individual feature based methods on public databases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376546","htmlLink":"/document/6026222/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fingerprint Recognition Scheme Based on Assembling Invariant Moments for Cloud Computing Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fingerprint Recognition Scheme Based on Assembling Invariant Moments for Cloud Computing Communications","sourcePdf":"jsyst-xiong-2165600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099523S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6079221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6079221","articleId":"6026222","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026223,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37535696600"},{"name":"Wenbin Dou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Dou","id":"37302164500"},{"name":"Lizhi You","affiliation":["Radar and Avionics Institute of AVIC, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Lizhi","lastName":"You","id":"37605449700"},{"name":"Xuequan Yan","affiliation":["Radar and Avionics Institute of AVIC, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Xuequan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37534597500"},{"name":"Rong Shen","affiliation":["Radar and Avionics Institute of AVIC, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37530869400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6026223","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1897},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Broadband antennas","Cavity resonators","Bandwidth","Couplings","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","impedance matching","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband proximity-coupled stacked microstrip antenna","cavity-backed configuration","stacked patches","coupled resonances","broadband impedance matching","antenna radiation patterns","3D interconnection structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broad bandwidth","cavity-backed microstrip antenna","proximity-coupling","stacked patches","three-dimensional interconnection"]}],"abstract":"A broadband cavity-backed proximity-coupled stacked microstrip antenna is presented.

During the read operation at high workload conditions (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n = 0.7 V), 8% improvement in read static noise margin (SNM) is achieved with only 7% access time penalty. During the read operation at low workload conditions, 54%-75% improvement in the read SNM enables low voltage operation under process variations.

Iso-leakage comparison of the proposed technique with the previously proposed IG FinFET 6T SRAM is also performed. An increase in the cell area by 35% is observed compared to the minimum-sized conventional FinFET SRAM.

We address the following problems inherent to supervised learning models: 1) the need of a large set of training images; 2) robustness to imaging conditions not present in the training data; and 3) complex search process. The innovations of our approach reside in a formulation that decouples the rigid and nonrigid detections, deep learning methods that model the appearance of the LV, and efficient derivative-based search algorithms. The functionality of our approach is evaluated using a data set of diseased cases containing 400 annotated images (from 12 sequences) and another data set of normal cases comprising 80 annotated images (from two sequences), where both sets present long axis views of the LV. Using several error measures to compute the degree of similarity between the manual and automatic segmentations, we show that our method not only has high sensitivity and specificity but also presents variations with respect to a gold standard (computed from the manual annotations of two experts) within interuser variability on a subset of the diseased cases. We also compare the segmentations produced by our approach and by two state-of-the-art LV segmentation models on the data set of normal cases, and the results show that our approach produces segmentations that are comparable to these two approaches using only 20 training images and increasing the training set to 400 images causes our approach to be generally more accurate. Finally, we show that efficient search methods reduce up to tenfold the complexity of the method while still producing competitive segmentations. In the future, we plan to include a dynamical model to improve the performance of the algorithm, to use semisupervised learning methods to reduce even more the dependence on rich and large training sets, and to design a shape model less dependent on the training set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537619","pubMedId":"21947526","htmlLink":"/document/6026237/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Segmentation of the Left Ventricle of the Heart From Ultrasound Data Using Deep Learning Architectures and Derivative-Based Search Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Segmentation of the Left Ventricle of the Heart From Ultrasound Data Using Deep Learning Architectures and Derivative-Based Search Methods","sourcePdf":"tip-carneiro-2169273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119726S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6026237","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6026238,"authors":[{"name":"Congyan Lang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6151934/6026238/6026238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Congyan Lang received the Ph.D. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University.

We shall mainly study the problem under unsupervised setting, i.e., saliency detection without learning from labeled images. A solution of multitask sparsity pursuit is proposed to integrate multiple types of features for detecting saliency collaboratively. Given an image described by multiple features, its saliency map is inferred by seeking the consistently sparse elements from the joint decompositions of multiple-feature matrices into pairs of low-rank and sparse matrices. The inference process is formulated as a constrained nuclear norm and as an \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2,1</sub>\n -norm minimization problem, which is convex and can be solved efficiently with an augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Compared with previous methods, which usually make use of multiple features by combining the saliency maps obtained from individual features, the proposed method seamlessly integrates multiple features to produce jointly the saliency map with a single inference step and thus produces more accurate and reliable results. In addition to the unsupervised setting, the proposed method can be also generalized to incorporate the top-down priors obtained from supervised environment. Extensive experiments well validate its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2169274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06026238.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2169274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency Detection by Multitask Sparsity Pursuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Saliency Detection by Multitask Sparsity Pursuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026238/","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6026238/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537620","pubMedId":"21947527","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency Detection by Multitask Sparsity Pursuit","sourcePdf":"tip-lang-2169274-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157996S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6026238","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6026239,"authors":[{"name":"Dunisha S.

They are about the even- and odd-mode impedances of the coupled transmission-line sections of the Marchand baluns and determined by coupling coefficients together with termination impedances. The particular property proposed in this paper is to choose the coupling coefficient arbitrarily, resulting in infinite sets of design formulas available. This is quite different from the conventional design approach in which only one coupling coefficient is possible. For the perfect isolation of the Marchand balun, an isolation circuit (IC) is needed, being composed of two 90\u00b0 transmission-line sections and resistance(s). Sufficient area to build such a long IC is, however, inherently not available. For this, ways to reduce the IC size are also suggested. To validate them, a microstrip Marchand balun terminated in 130 and 70 \u03a9 is designed at a design center frequency of 1.5 GHz and tested. The measured results are in good agreement with prediction, showing that power divisions are 3.57 and 3.262 dB, return losses at all ports are better than 21 dB, and the isolation is better than 20 dB around the design center frequency. The measured phase difference between two balanced signals is 180\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0 in about 50% bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2164618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6077122/06026240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2164618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077122","startPage":"2816","endPage":"2823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Design Formulas for Impedance-Transforming 3-dB Marchand Baluns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Design Formulas for Impedance-Transforming 3-dB Marchand Baluns","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12357242","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026240/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Design Formulas for Impedance-Transforming 3-dB Marchand Baluns","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ahn-2164618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108751S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6077122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6077122","articleId":"6026240","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026243,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Nose-Filho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Kenji Nose-Filho (M'11) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universidade Estadual Paulista J\u00falio de Mesquita Filho, Campus of Ilha Solteira-SP, Ilha Solteira, Brazil, in 2011, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.","He has experience in load forecasting and artificial neural networks."]},"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Nose-Filho","id":"38276194200"},{"name":"Anna Diva Plasencia Lotufo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Anna Diva Plasencia Lotufo (M'91) is an Assistant Professor at Universidade Estadual Paulista J\u00falio de Mesquita Filho, Campus of Ilha Solteira-SP, Ilha Solteira, Brazil.","She has experience in transient stability analysis, load forecasting, and artificial neural networks."]},"firstName":"Anna Diva Plasencia","lastName":"Lotufo","id":"37272438800"},{"name":"Carlos Roberto Minussi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Ilha Solteira, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Carlos Roberto Minussi is a Full Professor at Universidade Estadual Paulista J\u00falio de Mesquita Filho, Campus of Ilha Solteira-SP, Ilha Solteira, Brazil.","He has experience in transient stability analysis, load forecasting, dynamic and preventive control, contingency analysis, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic."]},"firstName":"Carlos Roberto","lastName":"Minussi","id":"37272446500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"6026243","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Substations","Forecasting","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term multinodal load forecasting","modified general regression neural network","electrical network system","bus load forecasting","short-time processing","artificial neural networks","New Zealand distribution subsystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bus load forecasting","data preprocessing","general regression neural network (GRNN)","short-term load forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026243","abstract":"Multinodal load forecasting deals with the loads of several interest nodes in an electrical network system, which is also known as bus load forecasting. To perform this demand, a technique that is precise, reliable, and has short-time processing is necessary. This paper uses two methodologies for short-term multinodal load forecasting. The first individually forecasts the local loads and the second forecasts the global load and individually forecasts the load participation factors to estimate the local loads. For the forecasts, a modified general regression neural network and a procedure to automatically reduce the number of inputs of the artificial neural networks are proposed. To design the forecasters, the previous study of the local loads was not necessary, thus reducing the complexity of the multinodal load forecasting. Tests were carried out by using a New Zealand distribution subsystem and the results obtained were found to be compatible with those available in the specialized literature.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2166566","startPage":"2862","endPage":"2869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2166566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06026243.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Multinodal Load Forecasting Using a Modified General Regression Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026243/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Multinodal Load Forecasting Using a Modified General Regression Neural Network","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6026243/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12288251","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Multinodal Load Forecasting Using a Modified General Regression Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-lotufo-2166566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077943S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6026243","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6026244,"authors":[{"name":"Zhipeng Liu","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37711257500"},{"name":"Fushuan Wen","affiliation":["Gardens Point, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Fushuan","lastName":"Wen","id":"37272253300"},{"name":"Gerard Ledwich","affiliation":["Gardens Point, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Ledwich","id":"37275948700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"6026244","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":277,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4535},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed power generation","Monte Carlo methods","Uncertainty","Electric vehicles","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","power distribution planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal siting","optimal sizing","distributed generators","plug-in electric vehicle","stochastic charging schedule","stochastic discharging schedule","wind generation unit","stochastic wind speed","solar generating source","stochastic illumination intensity","volatile fuel prices","uncertain load growth","distribution system planning","chance constrained programming framework","mathematical model","investment cost minimization","operating cost minimization","maintenance cost minimization","network loss cost minimization","capacity adequacy cost minimization","optimization variables","Monte Carlo simulation-embedded genetic-algorithm-based approach","IEEE 37-node test feeder","voltage profile","power-supply reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chance-constrained programming","distributed generator","distribution system","genetic algorithm","Monte Carlo simulation","plug-in electric vehicle","siting and sizing"]}],"abstract":"Some uncertainties, such as the uncertain output power of a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) due to its stochastic charging and discharging schedule, that of a wind generation unit due to the stochastic wind speed, and that of a solar generating source due to the stochastic illumination intensity, volatile fuel prices, and future uncertain load growth could lead to some risks in determining the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generators (DGs) in distribution system planning. Given this background, under the chance constrained programming (CCP) framework, a new method is presented to handle these uncertainties in the optimal siting and sizing of DGs. First, a mathematical model of CCP is developed with the minimization of the DGs' investment cost, operating cost, maintenance cost, network loss cost, as well as the capacity adequacy cost as the objective, security limitations as constraints, and the siting and sizing of DGs as optimization variables. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation-embedded genetic-algorithm-based approach is employed to solve the developed CCP model. Finally, the IEEE 37-node test feeder is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed model and method, and the test results have demonstrated that the voltage profile and power-supply reliability for customers can be significantly improved and the network loss substantially reduced.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06026244.pdf","startPage":"2541","endPage":"2551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Siting and Sizing of Distributed Generators in Distribution Systems Considering Uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026244/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Siting and Sizing of Distributed Generators in Distribution Systems Considering Uncertainties","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288252","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Siting and Sizing of Distributed Generators in Distribution Systems Considering Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-wen-2165972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059772S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"277","articleId":"6026244","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6026246,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore J.

The architecture of completely automated multiresolution edge snapper (CAMES) consists of the following two stages: 1) automated CA recognition based on a combination of scale-space and statistical classification in a multiresolution framework and 2) automated segmentation of lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitia (MA) interfaces for the far (distal) wall and IMT measurement. Our database of 365 B-mode longitudinal carotid images is taken from four different institutions covering different ethnic backgrounds. The ground-truth (GT) database was the average manual segmentation from three clinical experts. The mean distance \u00b1 standard deviation of CAMES with respect to GT profiles for LI and MA interfaces were 0.081 \u00b1 0.099 and 0.082 \u00b1 0.197 mm, respectively. The IMT measurement error between CAMES and GT was 0.078 \u00b1 0.112 mm. CAMES was benchmarked against a previously developed automated technique based on an integrated approach using feature-based extraction and classifier (CALEX). Although CAMES underestimated the IMT value, it had shown a strong improvement in segmentation errors against CALEX for LI and MA interfaces by 8% and 42%, respectively. The overall IMT measurement bias for CAMES improved by 36% against CALEX. Finally, this paper demonstrated that the figure-of-merit of CAMES was 95.8% compared with 87.4% for CALEX. The combination of multiresolution CA recognition and far-wall segmentation led to an automated, low-complexity, real-time, and accurate technique for carotid IMT measurement. Validation on a multiethnic/multi-institutional data set demonstrated the robustness of the technique, which can constitute a clinically valid IMT measurement for assistance in atherosclerosis disease management.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2169270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06026248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2169270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Completely Automated Multiresolution Edge Snapper\u2014A New Technique for an Accurate Carotid Ultrasound IMT Measurement: Clinical Validation and Benchmarking on a Multi-Institutional Database","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Completely Automated Multiresolution Edge Snapper\u2014A New Technique for an Accurate Carotid Ultrasound IMT Measurement: Clinical Validation and Benchmarking on a Multi-Institutional Database","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537621","pubMedId":"21947523","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6026248/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Completely Automated Multiresolution Edge Snapper\u2014A New Technique for an Accurate Carotid Ultrasound IMT Measurement: Clinical Validation and Benchmarking on a Multi-Institutional Database","sourcePdf":"tip-molinari-2169270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122014S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6026248","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026251,"authors":[{"name":"Hsu-Yung Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Hsu-Yung Cheng (M'08) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

For daytime surveillance, vehicles are detected via background modeling. For nighttime videos, headlights of vehicles need to be located and paired for vehicle detection. An algorithm based on likelihood computation is developed to pair the headlights of vehicles at night. Moreover, to balance between the robustness and abundance of acquired information, the proposed system adapts different strategies under different traffic conditions. Performing tracking would be preferred when traffic is smooth. However, under congestion conditions, it is better to obtain traffic parameters by estimation. We utilize a time-varying adaptive system state transition matrix in Kalman filter for better prediction in a traffic surveillance scene when performing tracking. We also propose a mechanism for estimating the traffic flow parameter via regression analysis. The experimental results have shown that the self-diagnosis ability and the modules designed for the system make the proposed system robust and reliable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026251/","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6026251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388594","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Highway Traffic Surveillance With Self-Diagnosis Abilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Highway Traffic Surveillance With Self-Diagnosis Abilities","sourcePdf":"tits-cheng-2160171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07073S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6082048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6082048","articleId":"6026251","onlineDate":"23 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6026259,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Ginolhac","affiliation":["SATIE-ENS CACHAN, CACHAN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Ginolhac","id":"37327308000"},{"name":"Philippe Forster","affiliation":["SATIE-ENS CACHAN, CACHAN Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Forster","id":"38526056400"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pascal","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Pascal","id":"37391786200"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Ovarlez","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Ovarlez","id":"37296816700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6026259","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian noise","Context","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian noise","radar clutter","radar detection","space-time adaptive processing","spatiotemporal phenomena","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normalized sample covariance matrix","heterogeneous noise","spatiotemporal adaptive processing","spherically invariant random vector","white Gaussian noise","data contamination","NSCM","eigenvectors","eigenvalues","clutter subspace projector","LR-STAP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias study","consistency","low rank clutter","normalized sample covariance matrix","SIRV","orthogonal projector","space time adaptive processing (STAP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026259","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06026259.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivation of the Bias of the Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix in a Heterogeneous Noise With Application to Low Rank STAP Filter","abstract":"In a previous work, we have developed a low-rank (LR) spatio-temporal adaptive processing (STAP) filter when the disturbance is modeled as the sum of a low-rank spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) clutter and a zero-mean white Gaussian noise.

energy-efficient on-chip communication network is crucial for the development of future multi-core chips. In this paper, a wideband millimeter-wave (mm-wave) transceiver was designed for the wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC) architecture. In order to reduce the power consumption of the transceiver, body-enabled circuit design techniques were implemented: Forward body-bias was used in the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and power amplifier (PA) circuits to lower the threshold voltages, reducing the supply voltage to 0.8 V. For up-and down-conversion mixers, power-hungry transconductance stages were eliminated by feeding the signals directly into the body terminals of the transistors. In addition, a novel feed-forward structure was designed to extend the bandwidth of the LNA at no cost in power consumption. Simulation results showed that the receiver has a double-sideband noise figure of less than 6 dB, and a peak gain of 20.5 dB, while the transmitter has an output P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1dB</sub>\n of 0 dBm. The transceiver achieved an overall 3-dB bandwidth of 18 GHz. Compared with our previous design without body-enabled design techniques, the receiver power consumption was reduced by 20.3%.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026282","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026282.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband body-enabled millimeter-wave transceiver for wireless Network-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026282/","displayDocTitle":"A wideband body-enabled millimeter-wave transceiver for wireless Network-on-Chip","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269428","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026282/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband body-enabled millimeter-wave transceiver for wireless Network-on-Chip","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Mp1A5101042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141335S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6026297,"authors":[{"name":"Rimesh M.

The amplifier is conventionally compensated with reverse-nested Miller compensation. The results show that bias-line compensation improves the bandwidth by 50% and PSRR by 5dB with \u00b11.25V power supplies. The amplifier with bias-line compensation is stable for a capacitive load in the range of 1pF to 200pF. The chip was fabricated in a 0.5\u03bcm 2P3M process.

However, this technical improvement has introduced an additional problem of reliability and/or durability degradation, leading to the inevitable use of error detection and correction techniques. To increase the number of correctable error bit in recent flash memories, ECC techniques tend to use longer code bits. As the silicon technology of NAND device evolves, such growing code bits for a user data page could overflow its corresponding spare area in later devices. In this paper, we propose a novel management mechanism of excessively long error correction codes using user data area. The proposed mechanism is capable of providing error correction capability for highly error-prone NAND devices by efficiently managing long ECC codes only with negligible performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026356","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026356.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-page management of error correction code for MLC flash storages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026356/","displayDocTitle":"In-page management of error correction code for MLC flash storages","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026356/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-page management of error correction code for MLC flash storages","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Mp2H4081007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055437S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6026357,"authors":[{"name":"Jonghong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jonghong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407285800"},{"name":"Junhee Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Junhee","lastName":"Cho","id":"38238011800"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026357","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1377},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Random access memory","Parity check codes","Tiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","CMOS memory circuits","error correction codes","flash memories","NAND circuits","parallel architectures","parity check codes","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed layered min-sum LDPC decoder","NAND Flash memory controllers","high-speed error correction blocks","multilevel cell technology","low density parity check decoder","regular EG-LDPC code","word-length reduction","variable-to-check messages","check-to-variable information compression","pipelined parallel architecture","fixed-point arithmetic optimization","node update processing units","quantization error mitigation","SRAM area","check-to-variable messages","floating-point implementation","CMOS process","size 0.13 mum"]}],"abstract":"NAND Flash memory controllers need to equip strong and high speed error correction blocks as the cell size scales down and multi-level cell technology is employed. We have developed an LDPC (low-density parity-check) decoder for NAND Flash memory error correction, and implemented it using a layered min-sum decoding architecture. A shortened (69615, 66897) regular EG-LDPC code that has the code rate of 96% is used, which has a good minimum distance and quasi-cyclic structure. In order to increase the decoding throughput and reduce the chip area, the word-length reduction of variable-to-check messages, compression of the check-to-variable information, and pipelined parallel architecture are employed. Furthermore, fixed-point arithmetic optimization of node update processing units is also conducted to mitigate the quantization error, thereby enhances the error performance of the decoder. The synthesis and simulation results show that the SRAM area storing check-to-variable messages is much reduced, which leads to 38% saving in hardware area compared to the non-optimized serial architecture, and the design also exhibits a good error performance that is close to that of the floating-point implementation.

This paper proposes an efficient hardware architecture for high performance and real-time smoothing filter that is applicable to enhance the disparity map image from 3D stereovision system. First, we maximally utilized the parallel and pipeline operations. Second, we adopted 11 by 11 sparse mask operations instead of using the 33 by 33 window to achieve faster processing time without sacrificing the quality obtained from 33 by 33 mask operation. Furthermore, our architecture showed faster in processing time and smaller in errors on the images, compared with the normal 33 by 33 mean filter. Our verification was accomplished on the Virtex5 XC5VLX330 FF1760 FPGA of Xilinx with using 100MHz system clock. In a 1280 by 720 video frames, our verification shows that the real-time image was processed with 325fps.

Using our approach reduces the energy used by up to 33.7% under a multipath fading channel environment.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026375","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026375.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic wordlength calibration for energy reduction FFT processors in wireless LAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026375/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic wordlength calibration for energy reduction FFT processors in wireless LAN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269518","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026375/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic wordlength calibration for energy reduction FFT processors in wireless LAN","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Ta1D3061023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044633S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6026376,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Woo Choi","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Republic of KOREA"],"firstName":"Sung-Woo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292421200"},{"name":"Gyung-Pyo Kim","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Republic of KOREA"],"firstName":"Gyung-Pyo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086732602"},{"name":"Jin-Kyeong Kim","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Research Department, ETRI, Daejeon, Republic of KOREA"],"firstName":"Jin-Kyeong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086735964"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026376","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026376","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parity check codes","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate QC-LDPC codes","partially-parallel LDPC decoder architecture","check node processing element","multirate system","RAM","check-bit message memory","FPGA","quasicyclic low density parity check codes","bit rate 360 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","Architecture","Quasi-cyclic","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a partially parallel LDPC decoder architecture for QC-LDPC codes.

The proposed receiver which was composed of high- and low-band LNAs and mixers, the TX canceller, and the LO shifter was implemented using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process and is under fabrication.

The check node processing is a major bottleneck of NB-LDPC decoding. Its computation complexity can be reduced by an iterative forward-backward scheme. Nevertheless, large memory is required in this scheme to store intermediate results. In this paper, a novel check node processing scheme and corresponding VLSI architectures are proposed for the Min-max NB-LDPC decoding. The proposed scheme first sorts out a limited number of the most reliable input messages. Then the forward and backward processes are carried out using only these messages. In addition, an innovative approach is developed to derive the output messages from only a small number of intermediate results without noticeable performance loss. Accordingly, both the memory requirement and computation complexity are greatly reduced.

The hypotheses that LFSR counters leads to reduced area and higher speed were validated using simulation and measurement results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026392/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12269535","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of binary and LFSR counters and efficient LFSR decoding algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of binary and LFSR counters and efficient LFSR decoding algorithm","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Ta1G5021041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056285S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6026393,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Goldstein","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Goldstein","id":"38355949700"},{"name":"Kunil Choe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Kunil","lastName":"Choe","id":"37605648500"},{"name":"Fred J.

Performance is compared between the 8T schemes and two well-performing six-transistor (6T) SRAM cells. Overall, the 8T-SRAM schemes perform better than the 6T schemes primarily because leakage current is reduced by low-power schemes that reverse-bias the back-gates of the cross-coupled inverters without an adverse impact on the read speed. This is especially true for larger SRAM arrays, e.g. 32\u00d71024.

In order to assess the reliability of MLUT, there is a need to develop efficient testing techniques. Typical approach so far has been to test every crosspoint on each crossbar MLUT exhaustively; this is not only tedious but is also prohibitively time consuming for designs involving large number of MLUTs. This paper introduces a novel testing scheme based on \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d approach to efficiently locate the defective memristors in a MLUT. The proposed testing scheme leverages upon a special current additive property of the memristor based multiplexer. It performs binary isolation of regions, reducing the search space by half whenever applicable. Numerical simulations clearly demonstrate that the approach is generic, deterministic, and scalable.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026406","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel \u201c divide and conquer \u201d testing technique for memristor based lookup table","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel \u201c divide and conquer \u201d testing technique for memristor based lookup table","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269549","htmlLink":"/document/6026406/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel \u201c divide and conquer \u201d testing technique for memristor based lookup table","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Tp1G3051013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075436S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6026409,"authors":[{"name":"James Moritz","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield Herts, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Moritz","id":"37283728200"},{"name":"Yichuang Sun","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield Herts, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yichuang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278741400"},{"name":"Xi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37072571300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026409","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","OFDM","Phase shift keying","Baseband","Transceivers","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","network synthesis","programmable filters","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable analogue baseband filters","cognitive radio","software defined radio","mobile communication systems","wireless communication systems","highly-integrated multistandard receivers","filter structures","on-chip tuning","gm-C circuit technique","active-RC circuit technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026409","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026409","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","abstract":"Analogue baseband filters are an important circuit for channel select and anti-aliasing in wireless and mobile communication systems.

In our method, with N cooperative CRs, an effective sensing resolution of N times higher than that of a single CR is achieved.

In cognitive radio networks, unlicensed users, which are referred to as cognitive radios (CRs), are allowed to dynamically access the frequency bands when licensed users (primary users) are inactive. Determining how to allocate unused frequency bands among CRs is one of the most important problems in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, a non-cooperative game theoretic framework to jointly allocate power and frequency bands among CRs in cognitive radio networks is proposed. The proposed game is proved to be an exact potential game, which will finally converge to Nash equilibrium by following the best response dynamics. Determining the best response strategy of each cognitive radio based on the observed opponent strategies is also provided in this paper.

The model enables analytical examination of the modulator I/Q imbalance effects on input-output relation as well as signal and noise transfer functions (STF and NTF) independently. Thus, the image rejection of the Q\u03a3\u0394M can be evaluated both from the input signal and quantization error point-of-view. With the help of the model, it is shown analytically that a mirror-frequency rejecting STF design is an efficient way to mitigate mirror-frequency interference originating from blocking signals at the input of the modulator because of the Q\u03a3\u0394M feedback branch I/Q mismatches. The straightforward parametrization allows reconfigurability of the transfer functions which can be exploited, e.g., together with multi-band noise shaping capabilities.

In this paper, we study how to design such a heterogeneous DRAM chip for improving both performance and energy efficiency, in particular, we propose a novel floorplan and several architectural techniques to fully exploit the benefits of 3-D die stacking technology when integrating an SRAM row cache into a DRAM chip.

Compared to the multi-core design for general purpose high performance computing, the memory design for an embedded multi-core processor should be customized and adapt to embedded application's characteristics, because it usually has significant impact on the system performance. In this paper, we study a 3D embedded multi-core DSP processor called 3D-iSPA, which is targeted for multimedia applications with two unique design features and leverages 3D DRAM stacking to improve performance. Many memory controller and wider memory data bus are proposed to make better use of the vertical through-silicon-via (TSV). The experimental results shows that duplicating memory controller can provide 10X speedup. The pure wider memory bus, however, has weak impact on the performance due to the limitation of on-chip interconnect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269574","htmlLink":"/document/6026431/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Leveraging on-chip DRAM stacking in an embedded 3D multi-core DSP system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging on-chip DRAM stacking in an embedded 3D multi-core DSP system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Ta2E5021054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07432S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6026432,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Kaehlert","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Kaehlert","id":"37541409300"},{"name":"Dirk Bormann","affiliation":["Chair of Integrated Analog Circuits and RF Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Bormann","id":"37576358500"},{"name":"Tobias D.

A frequency generator like an on-chip PLL can be used to choose the filter band without the need for an additional post-production calibration step. The LNA concept uses the advantages of the source degenerated as well as the shunt feedback LNA. The characteristic of the LNA and the filter function is described in detail. Measurement results from a prototype chip in 90 nm CMOS prove the presented theory. At 700 MHz the LNA offers a gain of 18 dB without filtering and 17 dB with filtering applied. The noise figure is as low as 3.1 dB and increases to 3.9 dB with filtering. The linearity in terms of the intermodulation point IP3 is as high as 0 dBm. A single filter gives 9.5 dB selectivity at 40 MHz frequency offset.

insufficient impedance of the transistor in the advanced process, but the accuracy suffers from the overshoot error caused by comparator delay. In this paper, a time-shifted correlated double sampling (TSCDS) scheme for CBSC circuit is proposed to alleviate the overshoot error as well as mitigating double loading. Moreover, we propose an overshoot correction technique to further suppress the overshoot after employing TSCDS. Speed bottleneck in the conventional CBSC circuit is limited by the fine discharging phase. With the proposed TSCDS and the overshoot correction, the CBSC circuit exploits the coarse charging and removes the fine discharging phase to achieve a 9-bit 50 MS/s pipelined ADC. Simulation results demonstrate a 54.3-dB SNDR is achieved with 3.65-mW power consumption in 90-nm CMOS process and 1.2-V supply.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026464","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026464.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 9-bit 50 MS/s CBSC pipelined ADC using time-shifted correlated double sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A 9-bit 50 MS/s CBSC pipelined ADC using time-shifted correlated double sampling","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026464/","accessionNumber":"12269606","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026464/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 9-bit 50 MS/s CBSC pipelined ADC using time-shifted correlated double sampling","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Tp1A2011063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053788S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6026486,"authors":[{"name":"Seongil O","affiliation":["Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Seongil","lastName":"O"},{"name":"Sungwoo Choo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sungwoo","lastName":"Choo","id":"38233550100"},{"name":"Jung Ho Ahn","affiliation":["Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673865600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026486","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":532},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Organizations","Energy efficiency","Timing","Wires","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","microprocessor chips","multiprogramming","multi-threading","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient DRAM array organization","main-memory storage","contemporary computer system","VLSI process technology","transistor","storage capacity","communication throughput","energy efficiency","reliability","fabrication cost","testing cost","DRAM architecture","design space","multithreaded workload","multiprogrammed workload","chip-multiprocessor system","die-stacked DRAM memory","energy-efficient array configuration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026486","abstract":"DRAM is widely used as main-memory storage in contemporary computer systems. As VLSI process technology advances, more transistors can be integrated in a single die leading to higher storage capacity and communication throughput per DRAM chip. New DRAM standards are created in order to keep up with these trends, and many factors such as performance, energy efficiency, reliability, and fabrication/testing cost are considered when a new DRAM architecture is designed. However, there are few studies on DRAM array organizations that consider both performance and energy efficiency of entire computer systems using the organizations. In this paper, we explore the design space of contemporary DRAM array organizations by varying the number of pages that can be concurrently accessed and the size of the pages.

It could be classified into Single-Level Cell (SLC) and Multi-Level Cell (MLC). SLC is the earlier design of flash memory and could store one bit per cell. Numerous excellent management schemes have been proposed for SLC. In recent years, MLC, which stores two or more bits per cell, has gradually replaced SLC due to its lower cost and higher density. However, MLC also brings new constraints, i.e., no partial programming and sequential page writes within a block, to the management. This paper proposes a novel mapping scheme for MLC. The goals of our research are to avoid time out by decreasing dummy page writes, to get a better response time by decreasing live page copying, and to prolong the life span of flash memory by decreasing block erasures.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026487","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-based management scheme for MLC flash memory storage system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Set-based management scheme for MLC flash memory storage system","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026487/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269629","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-based management scheme for MLC flash memory storage system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Tp1E5081008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100472S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6026488,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander S.

Various types of threats in PHY layer will be described, a testbed was developed and the results of security assessments on Primary User Emulation attack, Denial of Service attack and Spectrum Honeypot attack will be presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12269642","htmlLink":"/document/6026500/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Security vulnerabilities in physical layer of cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security vulnerabilities in physical layer of cognitive radio","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Wa1C4061043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037498S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"United States Government","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6026523,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Rezaee-Dehsorkh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Rezaee-Dehsorkh","id":"38274292100"},{"name":"Nassim Ravanshad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Nassim","lastName":"Ravanshad","id":"38274265400"},{"name":"Reza Lotfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Lotfi","id":"37270066800"},{"name":"Khalil Mafinezhad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Khalil","lastName":"Mafinezhad","id":"37543265400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026523","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical measurements","Noise measurement","Lead","Logic gates","Heating","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","harmonic distortion","low noise amplifiers","neurophysiology","prosthetics","resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear tunable amplifier","implantable neural recording applications","integrated tunable low-noise amplifier","signal band","modified system design","area noise linearity performance","pseudo-resistor","CMOS process","simulated integrated input-referred noise","total harmonic distortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026523","abstract":"A fully integrated tunable low-noise amplifier for neural recording applications is presented that is highly linear over the entire signal band.

ICI, which is caused by Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) between local oscillators in the transmitter and the receiver, can lead to severe system performance degradation.

Regarding fluidic-level synthesis, many related studies and CAD tools have been well-developed to synthesize the fluidic behaviors efficiently and effectively. However, research findings being highly-concerned with the chip-level design are still critically lacking. In this paper, we shall focus on chiplevel design and discuss related background and two major optimization problems posed by electrode addressing and control pin routing.

With multilevel PWM based transmitters, a superior electrical efficiency can be provided for a large signal dynamic. In this paper, the coding efficiency, which is the upper bound of the electrical efficiency, is investigated for multilevel pulsed transmitter architectures. It is shown that the optimum coding efficiency can be obtained by changing the input threshold according to the probability density function (pdf) of the signal. Closed-form expressions for determining the optimum threshold as well as the maximum coding efficiency are derived for given signal statistics.

CFD detector is an interesting alternative to energy detector, as it exploits hidden periodicities present in PU signals, but absent in noise. The CFD use quadratic transformations of the signals to determine the hidden periodicities. However, some knowledge about the signal might be needed at the detector (eg: the cyclic frequency), which leads to a non-blind detection. In this paper, we propose new blind sensing methods based on the investigation of the sparsity of the quadratic transformations in the cyclic frequency domain of man-made input signal. The proposed detectors are based on compressive sensing theory, where a distinctive feature can yield a sparse representation that is defined by only a very small number of so-called atoms. By exploiting the sparse property of the cyclic autocorrelation function in the case of man-made signal, we develop interesting detection algorithms that are not only blind and reliable but also computationally efficient for vacant bands detection. Simulation of one of these proposed methods show promising performance results of the proposed technique in terms of sensing vacant sub-bands in the spectrum.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026551.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind cyclostationary feature detector based on sparsity hypotheses for cognitive radio equipment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026551/","displayDocTitle":"Blind cyclostationary feature detector based on sparsity hypotheses for cognitive radio equipment","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269691","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind cyclostationary feature detector based on sparsity hypotheses for cognitive radio equipment","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Tp2H3061052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071309S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6026566,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086789473"},{"name":"Jizeng Wei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jizeng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37404767700"},{"name":"Shaofei Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shaofei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37536670100"},{"name":"Yisong Chang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yisong","lastName":"Chang","id":"38239673100"},{"name":"Wei Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37384043500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026566","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"abstract":"Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) is the most popular method to generate stereoscopic images.

By vulnerability analysis of a basic layout, drain to source short, source to source short and wrong gate control problems due to tube misalignment are found.

An analysis of butterfly plots clearly confirms that the single-BL SRAM has the larger static noise margin than the two-BL one. It is confirmed that the static noise margin in the single-BL SRAM is further increased when the BL is precharged to not VDD but to the lower value in the range of VDD/2 to 3VDD/4.

However the routing procedure of droplets can be facilitated by optimizing the placement of source droplets and corresponding targets with respect to a pre-scheduled arrangement of modules. This paper depicts a routing-aware (pre-)placement scheme followed by routing algorithm that optimizes (i) the average routing time, (ii) the latest arrival time for all the droplets in concurrent routing, (iii) the overall cell and thus electrode utilizations.

The BER-aware ADC design will lead to power and area reduction by relaxing the ADC requirements for 112Gb/s coherent optical communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BER-aware ADC design guideline for 112 Gb/s optical DP-QPSK systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026624","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026624.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A BER-aware ADC design guideline for 112 Gb/s optical DP-QPSK systems","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026624/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269764","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BER-aware ADC design guideline for 112 Gb/s optical DP-QPSK systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Wa2A5011129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050617S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6026629,"authors":[{"name":"Changhyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Changhyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086797826"},{"name":"Sangmin Heo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangmin","lastName":"Heo","id":"37086797760"},{"name":"Youngtaek Bae","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngtaek","lastName":"Bae","id":"37404676300"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026629","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026629","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Equations","Artificial neural networks","Phase modulation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","diversity reception","modulation","radio receivers","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward systems","relay selection","double-differential modulation","cooperative diversity systems","destination node","channel state information","multirelay node environment","channel estimations","multinode cooperative communications","received signal power","receiver complexity"]}],"abstract":"Most of existing research on cooperative diversity systems have assumed that the destination node and the relay node have perfect channel state information. However, it is difficult to obtain all the channel state information in the systems, especially in a multi-relay node environment. To greatly reduce the cost required for those channel estimations, a differential modulation technique can be applied to multi-node cooperative communications. However, the performance of this system can be severely degraded if the transmission among the relays is not synchronized. Therefore we first combine relay selection schemes with differential modulation. Even if some existing literatures considered how to select a relay, the selection methods in those papers still require the channel state information. In this paper, we propose a simple relay selection scheme which does not require any channel state information. Our method is based only on the received signal power at the destination. This selection method can also be applied to double-differential modulation and show that the proposed selection scheme can work well for both differential modulation schemes. Our relay selection scheme combined with these differential modulation can significantly reduce the receiver complexity and also improve data throughput by eliminating pilot symbol period needed for channel estimation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026629","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026629.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay selection for amplify-and-forward systems with differential and double-differential modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Relay selection for amplify-and-forward systems with differential and double-differential modulation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026629/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12269769","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026629/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay selection for amplify-and-forward systems with differential and double-differential modulation","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Wa2C5021055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052766S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6026632,"authors":[{"name":"Hoondong Noh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seodaemun-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hoondong","lastName":"Noh","id":"37683570500"},{"name":"Seungkyu Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seodaemun-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungkyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086791227"},{"name":"Chungyong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seodaemun-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chungyong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280420600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-856-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3899"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1548-3746"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1548-3746"}],"articleNumber":"6026632","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":367},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new iterative minimum mean square error(MMSE) based maximum likelihood(ML) detector for a single carrier frequency division multiple access(SC-FDMA) system.

Even though a forward body bias control over MOSFETs can achieve high-speed operation of the circuit, it induces large substrate leakage current and increases the power dissipation of the circuit. The CLSA-w/CR we propose, however, can achieve high-speed pre-charging without increasing power dissipation. We evaluated the performance of the CLSA-w/CR using SPICE with a set of 0.35-\u03bcm standard CMOS parameters. The pre-charge time decreased by 86.9% and the power dissipation increased by only 8.6% compared to that of a conventional CLSA.

During the integration, data retention logics are inserted between the power-gated cells and non-power-gated cells to hold power-gated data so that the operations of the non-power-gated cells function correctly. It is very important that the power consumption of the data retention logic should be very small so that the power reduction by CG and PG is not offset too much. Although there are several data retention flip-flop designs in the traditional PG design, no specific data retention logic design has been proposed during the integration of PG and CG. In this paper, a low power data retention logic design is proposed to fill this gap. The experimental results on ten ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits show that the power of our data retention logic design is only 1.58% of the power savings on average.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","flip-flops","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficient data retention logic design","power gating","clock gating","data retention flip-flop designs","ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026677","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026677","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026677.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026677/","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient data retention logic design in the integration of power gating and clock gating","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12269817","htmlLink":"/document/6026677/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient data retention logic design in the integration of power gating and clock gating","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Wp1G5031030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083273S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6026682,"authors":[{"name":"Qawi Harvard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boise State University, Boise, ID, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Qawi","lastName":"Harvard","id":"37086684809"},{"name":"R.

Secondly, a novel nested Miller compensation using two current buffers (NMCCB) in the feedback network is introduced. As opposed to previous NMC schemes, this scheme uses a non-inverting gain stage for the first stage and inverting gain stages for both the second and third stages. An inverting current buffer is utilized for the first time whereas previous NMC feedback networks utilized a positive current buffer. In conventional NMC, the major limitation is bandwidth since inner compensation capacitance loads the output node. In the proposed scheme, the two current buffers in the feedback network create two LHP zeros, cancelling one of the non-dominant poles and extending the bandwidth. Detailed small-signal modeling and analysis of the NMCCB compensation network is presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026685","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019810/6026262/06026685.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested Miller compensation using current buffers for multi-stage amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Nested Miller compensation using current buffers for multi-stage amplifiers","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026685/","accessionNumber":"12269825","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026685/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested Miller compensation using current buffers for multi-stage amplifiers","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Wp2A4011082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048166S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019810","isNumber":"6026262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019810","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6026262","articleId":"6026685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6026686,"authors":[{"name":"Igor M.

Unlike other classes of electronics and computing systems, security attacks on these devices have extreme consequences and must, therefore, be analyzed and prevented with utmost effort. Yet, very little work exists on this important topic and the security vulnerabilities of such systems are not well understood. We demonstrate security attacks that we have implemented in the laboratory on a popular glucose monitoring and insulin delivery system available on the market, and also propose defenses against such attacks. Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin delivery systems are becoming increasingly popular among patients with diabetes. These systems utilize wireless communication links, which are frequently utilized as a portal to launch security attacks. Our study shows that both passive attacks (eavesdropping of the wireless communication) and active attacks (impersonation and control of the medical devices to alter the intended therapy) can be successfully launched using public-domain information and widely available off-the-shelf hardware. The proposed attacks can compromise both the privacy and safety of patients. We propose two possible defenses against such attacks. One is based on rolling-code cryptographic protocols, and the other is based on body-coupled communication. Our security analysis shows that the proposed defenses have the potential to mitigate the security risks associated with personal healthcare systems.","doi":"10.1109/HEALTH.2011.6026732","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019109/6026719/06026732.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HEALTH.2011.6026732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hijacking an insulin pump: Security attacks and defenses for a diabetes therapy system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026732/","displayDocTitle":"Hijacking an insulin pump: Security attacks and defenses for a diabetes therapy system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12271111","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026732/","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hijacking an insulin pump: Security attacks and defenses for a diabetes therapy system","confLoc":"Columbia, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"p150li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06269S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019109","isNumber":"6026719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019109","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6026719","articleId":"6026732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6026802,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Raymond See","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Aaron Raymond See","id":"37087908618"},{"name":"Chih-Kuo Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Kuo Liang","id":"37087909179"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9277-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9276-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9275-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6026802","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":683},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sleep","Electroencephalography","Power harmonic filters","Entropy","Support vector machines","Feature extraction","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","entropy","feature extraction","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","pattern classification","sleep","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sleep EEG","sample entropy analysis","power spectrum analysis","sleep stage classification","single channel EEG","feature extraction","classification method","harmonic parameter","infinite impulse response filter","wavelet transform","Physionet database","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sample entropy","harmonic parameters","power spectrum","wavelet transform","sleep stage classification","support vector machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026802","abstract":"Research on the automation of sleep stage classification, particularly single channel EEG, has been a challenge for many years.

A total of 13 features were initially extracted and used for the training and testing of the sleep stage classification system. Analysis of the training data showed a distinct combination patterns between the sample entropy and harmonic parameters with a change in the sleep stage. In addition, a prototype for the sleep stage classification system was implemented. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized for the classification system.

As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.","doi":"10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","publicationTitle":"2011 Defense Science Research Conference and Expo (DSR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Defense Science Research Conference and Expo (DSR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6018838/6026799/06026885.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From system-centric to data-centric logging - Accountability, trust & security in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026885/","displayDocTitle":"From system-centric to data-centric logging - Accountability, trust & security in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12319069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026885/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From system-centric to data-centric logging - Accountability, trust & security in cloud computing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"DSRACTRyanKo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04927S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6018838","isNumber":"6026799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6018838","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6026799","articleId":"6026885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6026888,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi P.

We extend the unstructured schemes proposed by Buzzi to long-code spreading, which first estimates the Symbol Weighted Composite Channel Impulse Response (SW-CCIR) vectors and then extracts the timing informations. We also propose novel structured acquisition schemes, which directly estimate the multipath propagation delays by exploiting the a priori knowledge of the chip waveform. Both the structured and unstructured schemes are blind, since they require no other a priori information but the aperiodic spreading code of the desired user. Our numerical results demonstrate that the structured acquisition significantly outperforms both its unstructured counterpart and the classic correlator-based acquisition at a reasonable complexity increase.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2011.2169404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6017215/06026907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2011.2169404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017215","startPage":"671","endPage":"674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Acquisition for Bandlimited Long-Code DS-CDMA in Doubly-Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing Acquisition for Bandlimited Long-Code DS-CDMA in Doubly-Selective Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12286470","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Acquisition for Bandlimited Long-Code DS-CDMA in Doubly-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"lsp-hanzo-2169404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084116S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6017215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6017215","articleId":"6026907","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026912,"authors":[{"name":"Youfeng Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Youfeng","lastName":"Su","id":"37959891200"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281264600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6026912","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":447,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Multiagent systems","Distributed control","Lead","Observers","Synchronization","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","linear systems","multi-robot systems","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative output regulation","linear multiagent systems","distributed observer","dynamic full information distributed control scheme","leader-following consensus problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative control","linear systems","multi-agent systems","networked systems","output regulation"]}],"abstract":"In this technical note, we consider the cooperative output regulation of linear multi-agent systems.

Traditionally, per-word single error correction (SEC) codes are used. This is because they are simple to implement and provide low latency. More advanced codes have been considered, but their main drawback is the complexity of the decoders and the added latency. Recently, the use of one-step majority logic decodable codes has been proposed for memory protection. One-step majority logic decoding enables the use of low-complexity decoders, and low latency can also be achieved with moderate complexity. The main issue is that there are only a few codes that are one-step majority logic decodable. This restricts the choice of word lengths and error correction capabilities. In this paper, a method to derive new codes from a class of one-step majority logic decodable codes known as difference-set codes is proposed. The derived codes can also be efficiently implemented. As an example, a (64,45) triple error correction (TEC) code is derived and compared with existing SEC and TEC codes. The results presented enable a wider choice of word lengths and error correction capabilities that will be useful for memory designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Decoding","Logic gates","Error correction codes","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital storage","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triple-error correction code","data corruption","soft error","per-word single-error correction codes","per-word SEC codes","decoder complexity","one-step majority logic decodable codes","memory protection","one-step majority-logic decoding","difference-set codes","TEC codes","word lengths","memory designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Difference-set codes","error correction codes (ECCs)","majority logic decoding","memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026914","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2011.2169413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/6163420/06026914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2011.2169413","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A (64,45) Triple Error Correction Code for Memory Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A (64,45) Triple Error Correction Code for Memory Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026914/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6026914/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571588","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A (64,45) Triple Error Correction Code for Memory Applications","sourcePdf":"tdmr-reviriego-2169413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076716S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6163420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6163420","articleId":"6026914","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6026920,"authors":[{"name":"Branden Long","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6051730/6026920/6026920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Branden Long received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2009 from the University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, with particular emphasis on memresistive systems."]},"firstName":"Branden","lastName":"Long","id":"37892028500"},{"name":"Jorhan Ordosgoitti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6051730/6026920/6026920-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jorhan Ordosgoitti received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, in 2009 and 2010, respectively."]},"firstName":"Jorhan","lastName":"Ordosgoitti","id":"37888597100"},{"name":"Rashmi Jha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA","IBM Semiconductor Research and Development Center, East Fishkill, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6051730/6026920/6026920-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Rashmi Jha (S'05\u2013M'11) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2000 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","She was a Process Integration Engineer at the Semiconductor Research and Development Center, IBM, East Fishkill, NY, between 2006 and 2008.

The proposed device merges the functions of a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a low-pass filter (LPF). It consists of the cascade of three biquadratic cells made up by opamps in a series-shunt configuration, which features high input impedance, low load effects in the cascade blocks, and better frequency response. The opamp parameters are included in the overall biquad transfer function. This allows getting very low power performance, since the opamp bandwidth is not required to be much larger than the filter cutoff frequency. Moreover, the current consumption is optimized according to the selected gain level (1.3 mA at 0 dB-gain up to 1.9 mA at 40 dB-gain). The PGA features a 0-40 dB programmable gain range with a 5 dB gain-step. The LPF performs a sixth-order 255 MHz low-pass frequency response. For the overall chain the IIP3 is 14 dBm at 0 dB gain, while the input referred noise is 12.5 nV/\u221aHz at 40 dB gain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Noise","Receivers","Resistors","Linearity","Power demand","Electronics packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","low-pass filters","low-power electronics","radio receivers","transfer functions","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable gain amplifier","low-pass filter","ultra low power impulse-radio UWB receivers","CMOS power-optimized analog baseband chain","ultra-low-power impulse-radio ultra-wideband receivers","biquadratic cells","series-shunt configuration","frequency response","biquad transfer function","very low power performance","frequency 255 MHz","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active circuits","active filters","analog integrated circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6139305/06026928.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 255 MHz Programmable Gain Amplifier and Low-Pass Filter for Ultra Low Power Impulse-Radio UWB Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 255 MHz Programmable Gain Amplifier and Low-Pass Filter for Ultra Low Power Impulse-Radio UWB Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026928/","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026928/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12489718","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 255 MHz Programmable Gain Amplifier and Low-Pass Filter for Ultra Low Power Impulse-Radio UWB Receivers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-damico-2163886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109785S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6139305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6139305","articleId":"6026928","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6026930,"authors":[{"name":"Sunbo Shim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/6026930/6026930-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sunbo Shim (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electronics and electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2006, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2008, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at KAIST.","His research interests include transmitter architecture with a switch-mode CMOS PA and digitally intensive RF transmitters."]},"firstName":"Sunbo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37625221000"},{"name":"Songcheol Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/6026930/6026930-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Songcheol Hong (S'87\u2013M'88) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1982 and 1984, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, in 1989.","In May 1989, he joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea.

A generic modeling framework for voltage-source converter (VSC)-based MTDC grids, which is compatible with standard multimachine ac system models, is developed to carry out modal analysis and transient simulation. A general asymmetric bipole converter configuration comprising positive and negative pole converters and dc cable network with a positive, negative, and metallic return circuit is considered to enable different types of faults and dc-side unbalance studies. Detailed dynamic representation of the dc cables with distributed pi-section models is used along with the averaged model and decoupled control for the converter stations. An averaged model in Matlab/SIMULINK is validated against the detailed switched model in EMTDC/PSCAD by comparing the responses following small and large disturbances (e.g., faults on the dc side). Modal analysis is performed to identify the nature and root cause of the dynamic responses. Interaction between a multimachine ac system and an MTDC grid is examined following faults on the ac and dc sides and outage of converters. It is shown that the cause of instability in certain cases could only be attributed to the dc-side state variables. An averaged model of the converter along with the dc cable network is shown to be essential to analyze the stability and dynamics of combined ac-MTDC grids.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis of VSC MTDC Grids Connected to Multimachine AC Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06026937.pdf","startPage":"2774","endPage":"2784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis of VSC MTDC Grids Connected to Multimachine AC Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6026937/","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288253","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis of VSC MTDC Grids Connected to Multimachine AC Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-chaudhuri-2165735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076523S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6026937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6026941,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Sturt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Alexander Sturt received the M.Eng. degree in engineering science from Oxford University, Oxford, U.K., in 1991, and the M.Sc. degree in sustainable energy futures from Imperial College, London, U.K., in 2008.

High wind penetrations demand just-in-time commitment decisions that reflect the uncertainties in the wind infeed, so that it is desirable to generate the scheduling decisions using stochastic unit commitment (SUC) with rolling planning. However, the computational burden can make such methods impractical in long simulations. We present an efficient formulation of the SUC problem that is designed for use in scheduling simulations of single-bus power systems. Unlike traditional SUC techniques, the proposed formulation uses a quantile-based scenario tree structure that avoids the need for exogenous operating reserves. We compare the performance of various tree topologies in year-long simulations of a large system. Simple quantile-based trees give statistically significant cost improvements over fixed-quantile deterministic methods and compare favorably with trees based on Monte Carlo-generated scenarios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2164558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/06026941.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"334","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2164558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Stochastic Scheduling for Simulation of Wind-Integrated Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Stochastic Scheduling for Simulation of Wind-Integrated Power Systems","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6026941/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12479050","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Stochastic Scheduling for Simulation of Wind-Integrated Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-sturt-2164558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10369S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"6026941","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":6026942,"authors":[{"name":"Federica Bordoni","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/6026942/6026942-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Federica Bordoni received the Laurea degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","From 2002 through 2004, she was with the Department of Ingegneria dell'Informazione of the University of Pisa, where her research activity included modern spectral estimation and detection techniques for multichannel and multidata signal processing, with applications both in the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and radar surveillance.

Among these techniques, the azimuth phase coding (APC), recently proposed to suppress range ambiguities in conventional SAR systems, stands out for its negligible implementation complexity and its effectiveness for point and distributed ambiguities. This paper investigates the possibility of applying the APC technique to the new, forthcoming generation of multichannel SAR systems, based on digital beamforming on receive. The extension of APC to multichannel SAR systems is mathematically described. Specific merit figures are defined to quantify the APC performance. A numerical analysis is developed to characterize the influence on the APC behaviors of the main SAR system parameters. Finally, an example of APC performance is provided, by considering two multichannel SAR systems based on a planar and a reflector antenna.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026942/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477856","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ambiguity Suppression by Azimuth Phase Coding in Multichannel SAR Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ambiguity Suppression by Azimuth Phase Coding in Multichannel SAR Systems","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bordoni-2161672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.237081S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6133465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6133465","articleId":"6026942","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6026944,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyun Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6172975/6026944/6026944-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanyun Xu received the B.E. degree from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2007.

Our method consists of three steps. First, we apply a constrained optimization based microscopy image segmentation method that exploits phase contrast optics to extract candidate subsequences in the input image sequence that contains mitosis events. Then, we apply a max-margin hidden conditional random field (MM-HCRF) classifier learned from human-annotated mitotic and nonmitotic sequences to classify each candidate subsequence as a mitosis or not. Finally, a max-margin semi-Markov model (MM-SMM) trained on manually-segmented mitotic sequences is utilized to reinforce the mitosis classification results, and to further segment each mitosis into four predefined temporal stages. The proposed method outperforms the event-detection CRF model recently reported by Huh as well as several other competing methods in very challenging image sequences of multipolar-shaped C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. For mitosis detection, an overall precision of 95.8% and a recall of 88.1% were achieved. For mitosis segmentation, the mean and standard deviation for the localization errors of the start and end points of all mitosis stages were well below 1 and 2 frames, respectively. In particular, an overall temporal location error of 0.73 \u00b11.29 frames was achieved for locating daughter cell birth events.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Microscopy","Image sequences","Markov processes","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","image segmentation","image sequences","Markov processes","medical image processing","optical microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-Markov Model","mitosis segmentation","time-lapse phase contrast microscopy","image sequences","max-margin learning framework","large-scale time-lapse phase contrast microscopy","max-margin hidden conditional random field classifier","human-annotated mitotic sequence","nonmitotic sequence","mitosis classification","event-detection CRF model","multipolar-shaped C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells","temporal location error","daughter cell birth events"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden conditional random fields","large-scale cell population","mitosis detection","phase contrast microscopy","sequence segmentation","semi-Markov model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Cell Tracking","Cells, Cultured","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Markov Chains","Mesenchymal Stromal Cells","Mesenchymal Stromal Cells","Mice","Mice, Inbred C3H","Microscopy, Phase-Contrast","Microscopy, Video","Mitosis","Models, Biological","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Time-Lapse Imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2169495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6142636/06026949.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6142636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2169495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-Markov Model for Mitosis Segmentation in Time-Lapse Phase Contrast Microscopy Image Sequences of Stem Cell Populations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-Markov Model for Mitosis Segmentation in Time-Lapse Phase Contrast Microscopy Image Sequences of Stem Cell Populations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026949/","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026949/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12508931","pubMedId":"21954199","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-Markov Model for Mitosis Segmentation in Time-Lapse Phase Contrast Microscopy Image Sequences of Stem Cell Populations","sourcePdf":"tmi-liu-2169495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10267S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6142636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6142636","articleId":"6026949","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6026950,"authors":[{"name":"Ryad Benosman","affiliation":["Vision Institute and the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics, University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6062577/6026950/6026950-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ryad Benosman is an Associate Professor with University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France, leading the Natural Computation and Retina Models Laboratory, Vision Institute, Paris.

Establishing such a geometric constraint is of primary importance, as it allows the recovery of the 3-D structure of scenes. Estimating the epipolar constraints of nonperspective stereo is difficult, they can no longer be defined because of the complexity of the sensor geometry. This paper will show that these limitations are, to some extent, a consequence of the static image frames commonly used in vision. The conventional frame-based approach suffers from a lack of the dynamics present in natural scenes. We introduce the use of neuromorphic event-based-rather than frame-based-vision sensors for perspective stereo vision. This type of sensor uses the dimension of time as the main conveyor of information. In this paper, we present a model for asynchronous event-based vision, which is then used to derive a general new concept of epipolar geometry linked to the temporal activation of pixels. Practical experiments demonstrate the validity of the approach, solving the problem of estimating the fundamental matrix applied, in a first stage, to classic perspective vision and then to more general cameras. Furthermore, this paper shows that the properties of event-based vision sensors allow the exploration of not-yet-defined geometric relationships, finally, we provide a definition of general epipolar geometry deployable to almost any visual sensor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2167239","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2167239","startPage":"1723","endPage":"1734","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6062577/06026950.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026950/","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Event-Based Hebbian Epipolar Geometry","volume":"22","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12328353","pubMedId":"21954205","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6026950/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Event-Based Hebbian Epipolar Geometry","sourcePdf":"tnn-benosman-2167239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078878S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6062577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6062577","articleId":"6026950","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6026951,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6062577/6026951/6026951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ke Chen (M'97\u2013SM'00) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science in 1984, 1987, and 1990, respectively.","He has been with the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., since 2003.

However, most of acoustic representations characterize all different kinds of information as whole, which could hinder either a speech or a speaker recognition (SR) system from producing a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural architecture (DNA) especially for learning speaker-specific characteristics from mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, an acoustic representation commonly used in both speech recognition and SR, which results in a speaker-specific overcomplete representation. In order to learn intrinsic speaker-specific characteristics, we come up with an objective function consisting of contrastive losses in terms of speaker similarity/dissimilarity and data reconstruction losses used as regularization to normalize the interference of non-speaker-related information. Moreover, we employ a hybrid learning strategy for learning parameters of the deep neural networks: i.e., local yet greedy layerwise unsupervised pretraining for initialization and global supervised learning for the ultimate discriminative goal. With four Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) benchmarks and two non-English corpora, we demonstrate that our overcomplete representation is robust in characterizing various speakers, no matter whether their utterances have been used in training our DNA, and highly insensitive to text and languages spoken. Extensive comparative studies suggest that our approach yields favorite results in speaker verification and segmentation. Finally, we discuss several issues concerning our proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"22","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328354","pubMedId":"21954206","htmlLink":"/document/6026951/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Speaker-Specific Characteristics With a Deep Neural Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Speaker-Specific Characteristics With a Deep Neural Architecture","sourcePdf":"tnn-chen-2167240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073282S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6062577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6062577","articleId":"6026951","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026954,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Lu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control and the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Jilin University of Technology, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6099846/6026954/6026954-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaohui Lu received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Beihua University, Jilin, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in operations research and control theory from the Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China, in 2007.

Because of the physical characteristics, the input and output constraints are considered explicitly in the problem formulation. The contradictory requirements of less friction losses and less driveline shock are included in the objective function. The designed controller is tested under nominal conditions and changed conditions. The simulation results show that, during the start-up process, the AMT clutch with the proposed controller works very well, and the process meets the control objectives: fast clutch lockup time, small friction losses, and the preservation of driver comfort, i.e., smooth acceleration of the vehicle. At the same time, the closed-loop system has the ability to reject uncertainties, such as the vehicle mass and road grade.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2167630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/6099846/06026954.pdf","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2212","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2167630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Start-up Process of AMT Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Start-up Process of AMT Vehicles","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6026954/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409255","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","pubMedId":"21954207","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026954/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Start-up Process of AMT Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tnn-lu-pt2-2167630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193108S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"6099846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6099846","articleId":"6026954","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6026957,"authors":[{"name":"Si Nan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6026957/6026957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Si Nan Li was born in China in 1986.

Theoretical reasons for such phenomena are provided and experimentally confirmed with practical measurements in a wireless power transfer system comprising several magnetically coupled resonators arranged in a straight domino form.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2169460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06026958.pdf","startPage":"1905","endPage":"1916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2169460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Magnetic Coupling of Nonadjacent Resonators on Wireless Power Domino-Resonator Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026958/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Magnetic Coupling of Nonadjacent Resonators on Wireless Power Domino-Resonator Systems","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543564","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026958/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Magnetic Coupling of Nonadjacent Resonators on Wireless Power Domino-Resonator Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-hui-2169460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075254S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6026958","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6026966,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chang Yeh","affiliation":["Integration and Collaboration Laboratory, Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Advanced Analytic Institute, School of Software, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Wei-Chang Yeh (M'99\u2013SM'09) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Industrial Engineering, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

By taking into consideration the non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete nature of the problem, the proposed algorithm efficiently seeks the optimal disassembly sequence with a novel approach; this approach involves reducing the initial solution space and using a combination of soft-computing algorithms for achieving higher computational efficiency and solution quality.

The algorithm significantly reduces the number of signals that are exchanged between nodes, and yet obtains the optimal LCMV beamformers as if each node has access to all the signals in the network. We consider the case where all the steering vectors are known, as well as the blind beamforming case where the steering vectors are not known. We formally prove convergence and optimality for both versions of the LC-DANSE algorithm. We also consider the case where nodes update their local beamformers simultaneously instead of sequentially, and we demonstrate by means of simulations that applying a relaxation is often required to obtain a converging algorithm in this case. We also provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in a realistic speech enhancement scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06026968.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Node-Specific LCMV Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026968/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Node-Specific LCMV Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425231","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6026968/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Node-Specific LCMV Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-bertrand-2169409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080745S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6026968","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6026970,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

They extend the standard CS paradigm from sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and possibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture these signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably similar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction algorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that compare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on spectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive radio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that the RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering, but employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate system sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions. Last, we show that \u201cblock convolution\u201d is a fundamental aspect of the MWC, allowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband) signals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for continuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes detailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ, sometimes substantially, from published results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2169408","startPage":"155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06026970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2169408","endPage":"171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconciling Compressive Sampling Systems for Spectrally Sparse Continuous-Time Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6026970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reconciling Compressive Sampling Systems for Spectrally Sparse Continuous-Time Signals","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6026970/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12425233","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconciling Compressive Sampling Systems for Spectrally Sparse Continuous-Time Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-lexa-2169408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113471S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6026970","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6026989,"authors":[{"name":"Liwei Shi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37531265800"},{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Dept. of Intelligent Mechanical System Eng'g, Kagawa University, Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Kinji Asaka","affiliation":["AIST, Kansai Research Institute, Ikeda, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kinji","lastName":"Asaka","id":"37275258500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0839-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0838-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6247"}],"articleNumber":"6026989","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Actuators","Equations","Mathematical model","Floors","Grasping","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microrobots","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired underwater microrobot","compact structure","multifunctional locomotion","pollution detection","video mapping","ionic polymer metal composite actuators","crawling speed","underwater floor","grasping motion","walking mechanism","walking speed"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6026989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired underwater microrobot with compact structure and multifunctional locomotion","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2011.6026989","startPage":"203","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019107/6026973/06026989.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2011.6026989","abstract":"For applications such as pollution detection and video mapping in limited space, underwater microrobots are urgently demanded.

By the inherent robustness of the variable structure controller, simulations show that the precision stage can track the trajectory precisely and can reject the disturbance introduced by thrust ripples.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2011.6027027","startPage":"505","endPage":"509","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019107/6026973/06027027.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2011.6027027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO variable structure control of a precision stage using PMLSM drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Permanent magnet motors","Uncertainty","Reluctance motors","Simulation","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","friction","linear synchronous motors","machine control","MIMO systems","permanent magnet motors","position control","synchronous motor drives","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO variable structure controller","PMLSM drives","precision engineering","positioning stage","single layer precision stage","permanent magnet linear synchronous motors","friction reduction","air bearings","tracking control","thrust ripples"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PMLSM","Precision Stage","Variable Structure Control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"MIMO variable structure control of a precision stage using PMLSM drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12271987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO variable structure control of a precision stage using PMLSM drives","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048425S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019107","isNumber":"6026973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019107","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6026973","articleId":"6027027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6027053,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Dietz","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Dietz","id":"37982365800"},{"name":"Alexander Verl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Verl","id":"37370221100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0839-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0838-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6247"}],"articleNumber":"6027053","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Service robots","Joints","Mathematical model","Robot kinematics","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial robots","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stopping behavior","industrial robots","human-robot interaction","complementarity-based treatment","friction forces","time-stepping scheme","system matrices","autocoding scheme","arbitrary serial kinematic robots","friction curve","set-valuedness","mass parameter values","specific robot motions","braking behavior","hazard assessment","high robot speeds"]}],"abstract":"The braking behavior of industrial robots is an important aspect for the hazard assessment of human-robot interaction involving high robot speeds. This paper proposes an adaptation of a complementarity-based treatment of friction forces [1] to the simulation of the stopping behavior of robots. A time-stepping scheme is used for integration. The system matrices are computed using an auto-coding scheme to allow rapid adaptation to arbitrary serial kinematic robots. The model is capable of handling the set-valuedness of the friction curve. Comparison of the model results with the measured braking behavior of an industrial robot shows that the general behavior of the model is correct. However, the agreement of model and measurement is still not satisfying. Better mass parameter values and functions for the brake moment are required. Simulations performed with the model suggest a strong and possibly hazardous decay of the stopping behavior for specific robot motions that is hard to predict without an appropriate model.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2011.6027053","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019107/6026973/06027053.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2011.6027053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6026973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of the stopping behavior of industrial robots using a complementarity-based approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of the stopping behavior of industrial robots using a complementarity-based approach","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6027053/","accessionNumber":"12272013","publicationDate":"July 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of the stopping behavior of industrial robots using a complementarity-based approach","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"0121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059608S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019107","isNumber":"6026973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019107","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6026973","articleId":"6027053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6027098,"authors":[{"name":"Michail Makrodimitris","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Michail","lastName":"Makrodimitris","id":"37085523455"},{"name":"Alexandros Nikolakakis","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Nikolakakis","id":"37086755586"},{"name":"Evangelos Papadopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering National Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Papadopoulos","id":"37273090500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0839-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0838-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6247"}],"articleNumber":"6027098","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Collision avoidance","Mobile robots","Games","Color","Wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","computer games","hardware-software codesign","interactive systems","mechatronics","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi autonomous color line following educational robot","interactive game","mobile robots","mechatronics aspects","hardware software implementation design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-color line-follower","human-robot interaction","educational mechatronic game","mechatronic design"]}],"abstract":"We describe an interactive game for children, employing semi-autonomous color line-following mobile robots.

The antenna is composed of a four ports antenna array based on arranged eight L-shaped quarter-wavelength slot antenna elements. This type of antenna array is a planar structure and its maximum directional radiation beam pattern presents in azimuth plane with the covering of 360 degree. The operation of antenna array is based on the statuses of ON/OFF stage of PIN diodes in each individual slot antenna element and the combined signals from four ports. Consequently, by proper controlling the stage of PIN diodes, the antenna can exposes its characteristic of switchable and/or reconfigurable beam patterns in \u03c6-plane. The antenna array size is about 56 mm in square with four ports. To prove the concept, a 2.5-2.8 GHz switched-beam antenna for WLAN applications in MIMO is simulated and fabricated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact switched and reconfigurable 4-ports beam antenna array for MIMO applications","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Intelligent Radio for Future Personal Terminals","doi":"10.1109/IMWS2.2011.6027210","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Intelligent Radio for Future Personal Terminals","pdfPath":"/iel5/6019106/6027162/06027210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS2.2011.6027210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compact switched and reconfigurable 4-ports beam antenna array for MIMO applications","conferenceDate":"24-25 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027210/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12271924","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact switched and reconfigurable 4-ports beam antenna array for MIMO applications","confLoc":"Daejeon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"PS15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040791S","chronDate":"24-25 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6019106","isNumber":"6027162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6019106","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6027162","articleId":"6027210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6027284,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37835948800"},{"name":"Alexandre Heili","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Heili","id":"38232888700"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Odobez","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Odobez","id":"37271897800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0845-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0844-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0843-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6027284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplings","Estimation","Surveillance","Three dimensional displays","Noise measurement","Joints","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","image classification","particle filtering (numerical methods)","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body location estimation","body pose location","monocular surveillance video","multiobject tracking","pose classification","noisy observation","3D space","particle filtering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027284","abstract":"In surveillance videos, cues such as head or body pose provide important information for analyzing people's behavior and interactions.

First, body pose classification is conducted using sparse representation technique on each frame of the tracks, generating (noisy) observation on body poses. Then, both location and body pose in 3D space are estimated jointly in a particle filtering framework by utilizing a soft coupling of body pose with the movement. The experiments show that the proposed system successfully tracks body position and pose simultaneously in many scenarios.

A subsequent analysis of the detected regions is used to ascertain if an object was placed in or removed from the scene. Static objects are prevented from being incorporated into the empty scene model. Removed objects are rapidly dropped from both models. In this way, we build a very precise model of the empty scene and improve the foreground segmentation results of a single background model.

While the trajectories of tracked individuals are responsible for producing samples to the appearance signature learning process, it is highly risky to directly label these appearance samples with tracker IDs, due to possible tracker switches and temporary tracker losses. Through the exploration of trajectory fidelity in terms of temporal continuity and spatial locality, we show that the side information from tracking, in the form of pairwise constraints, such as \u201cmust-link\u201d and \u201ccannot-link\u201d, could significantly benefit signature learning. Furthermore, to learn and update an online identity signature pool, a two-step approach is proposed: 1) a data clustering step based on spectral kernel learning with pairwise constraints, and 2) a large-margin based discriminative signature model learning step.

Ideally, such solutions should operate in real time using minimal resources and scale to environments with complex topologies.

If the estimation is highly accurate then the high resolution (HR) frames reconstructed is better in quality. Otherwise with small errors in estimation, they will create more degradation in the reconstructed HR frames. In many recent studies, the motion estimation is applied on every block of pixels. There is too little input data for estimating process so that it is hard to get high accuracy in results. This paper presents a new method for SR video image reconstruction through two main ideas. First, video frames are separated into two sections, as scene and motive objects. The motions of the scene are the same and uniform. We will have much data for estimating, so that the result can be more accurate. Second, the motion estimation is based on three parameters, rotation and shifts in vertical and horizontal. It presents a perfectly estimating for real motion of camera when capturing video frames. Based on that, an efficient algorithm is proposed by combination of block matching search method and minimum mean square error estimation. The results of the proposed algorithm are more accurate than those of other recent algorithms. It can be easy to see one we visualize the HR video frames reconstructed by other algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Strontium","Estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Context","Motion estimation","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","least mean squares methods","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scene-based video superresolution","minimum mean square error estimation","motion estimation","high resolution frames reconstruction","SR video image reconstruction","block matching search method"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2011.6027433","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6022617/6027409/06027433.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2011.6027433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scene-based video super-resolution with minimum mean square error estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scene-based video super-resolution with minimum mean square error estimation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12272348","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6027433/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene-based video super-resolution with minimum mean square error estimation","confLoc":"Da Nang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"1c035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038152S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6022617","isNumber":"6027409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6022617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6027409","articleId":"6027433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6027452,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Quoc Bao Vo","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Quoc Bao","lastName":"Vo"},{"name":"Quoc Cuong Le","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quoc Cuong","lastName":"Le"},{"name":"Quang Phu Le","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quang Phu","lastName":"Le"},{"name":"Dinh Thuan Tran","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dinh Thuan","lastName":"Tran"},{"name":"Thien Quy Nguyen","affiliation":["Radio Frequency Directorate, Vietnam Ministry of Information and Communications, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thien Quy","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Minh Trung Lam","affiliation":["Radio Frequency Directorate, Vietnam Ministry of Information and Communications, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Minh Trung","lastName":"Lam"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1206-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1205-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-1020"}],"articleNumber":"6027452","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Cognitive radio","Mobile communication","Frequency measurement","Cities and towns","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vietnam spectrum occupancy measurements","cognitive radio application","wireless transmission","scarce radio spectrum","fixed spectrum allocation policy","cognitive radio network","unlicensed users","spectrum usage pattern"]}],"abstract":"The rapid growth of demand for wireless transmission has placed great pressure on the scarce radio spectrum due to the fixed spectrum allocation policy and cognitive radio (CR) is considered as a promising solution to such the problem. The main idea behind a cognitive radio network is for the unlicensed users (also called secondary users) to exploit opportunistically the underutilized spectrum licensed to a licensed network (referred to as a primary network). Before investigating the technical and political implications of CR, it is important to know to what extent the licensed bands are temporally unoccupied. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the spectrum usage pattern in Vietnam in the frequency bands ranging from 20 MHz to 3000 MHz in Ho Chi Minh City and Long An province. The purpose of the measurement is to find how the scarce radio spectrum allocated to different services is utilized in Vietnam and identify the bands that could be accessed for future opportunistic use due to their low or no active utilization. These analyses indicate that, on average, the actual spectral usage in all bands is 13.74% and 11.19% for Ho Chi Minh City and Long An province, respectively. The experiment results also show that the spectrum band assigned for analog television (470-806) is the highest occupancy band with 58%.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2011.6027452","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6022617/6027409/06027452.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2011.6027452","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vietnam spectrum occupancy measurements and analysis for cognitive radio applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Vietnam spectrum occupancy measurements and analysis for cognitive radio applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027452/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027452/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12272367","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vietnam spectrum occupancy measurements and analysis for cognitive radio applications","confLoc":"Da Nang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"1f106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048216S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6022617","isNumber":"6027409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6022617","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6027409","articleId":"6027452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6027455,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Vinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Sciences, 227 Nguyen Van Cu St., Dist.5, HCM City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Anh Vinh","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Huu Phuong Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Sciences, 227 Nguyen Van Cu St., Dist.5, HCM City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Huu Phuong","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Nguyen Binh Le","affiliation":["Dept. of Physics and Informatics, Faculty of Physics, University of Sciences, HCMC, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Binh","lastName":"Le"},{"name":"Van Liet Dang","affiliation":["Dept. of Physics and Informatics, Faculty of Physics, University of Sciences, HCMC, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Van Liet","lastName":"Dang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1206-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1205-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-1020"}],"articleNumber":"6027455","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Stimulated emission","Optical distortion","Nonlinear optics","Optical noise","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","mean square error methods","optical dispersion","optical feedback","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital lightwave receiver","parallel decision feedback equalization","RZ DQPSK","optical communication system","recursive least square","mean square error adaptive algorithms","chromatic dispersion","optically amplified fiber transmission","electronic preamplifier","CD tolerance","MSE algorithms","Matlab Simulink platform","distance 1000 km","bit rate 100 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate by simulation a parallel decision feedback equalization (DFE) technique at multi-GSa/s sampling rate employing recursive least square (RLS) and mean square error (MSE) adaptive algorithms to mitigate the chromatic dispersion (CD) and nonlinear impairments in 100 Gbps 1000 km long-haul optically amplified fiber transmission systems under RZ-DQPSK modulation formats.

UWB communication systems are designed to intent to low power, low cost, and low complexity devices. However, costly high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is required to convert RF/IF signals to digital form for subsequent baseband processing in UWB system. By exploiting sparse property of UWB signal, using compressive sensing (CS) to reduce the sampling rate is a perspective approach. In this paper, we propose a UWB communications system using compressive sensing combined with time-hopping (TH) pulse position modulation (PPM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), called CS-TH-UWB. This system is designed aims to reduce the sampling rate of the origin UWB system. CS technique possesses capability to implement under Nyquist sampling rate at transmitter side. At the receiver side, the under Nyquist rate samples are reconstructed with an acceptable loss. The simulation of this system is carried out to evaluate the BER of CS-TH-UWB. The results show that at low compression ratio of sampling rate, the different in BER performance is negligible. The higher compression ratio is the more degradation of BER performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6022617/6027409/06027477.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2011.6027477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2011.6027477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027409","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of compressive sensing in time hopping multi-user UWB system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","AWGN","Sensors","IEEE 802.15 Standards","OFDM","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","error statistics","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse position modulation","radio transmitters","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","time hopping","multiuser UWB system","ultra wideband communication","analog-to-digital converters","baseband processing","pulse position modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","Nyquist sampling","transmitter","signal reconstruction","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","multi-user","time hopping","compressive sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of compressive sensing in time hopping multi-user UWB system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12272392","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of compressive sensing in time hopping multi-user UWB system","confLoc":"Da Nang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"2d128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107158S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6022617","isNumber":"6027409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6022617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6027409","articleId":"6027477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6027489,"authors":[{"name":"Duc-Tan Tran","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics & Telecommunications, VNU University of Engineering & Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Duc-Tan","lastName":"Tran"},{"name":"Linh-Trung Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics & Telecommunications, VNU University of Engineering & Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Linh-Trung","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Minh-Chinh Truong","affiliation":["College of Education, Hue University, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Minh-Chinh","lastName":"Truong"},{"name":"Marie Luong","affiliation":["L2TI Laboratory, University, Villetneuse, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Luong","id":"37408152600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1206-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1205-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-1020"}],"articleNumber":"6027489","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Image coding","Biomedical imaging","Ions","Chirp","Brain","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","chirp modulation","image reconstruction","image sequences","matrix algebra","medical image processing","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic compressed sensing","measurement matrix","spread-spectrum technique","chirp modulation","chaotic sequences","magnetic resonance imaging","numerical simulation","chaotic CS techniques","MRI acquisition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","deterministic design","structured design","chaotic sequence","spread-spectrum","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","fast acquisition"]}],"abstract":"This paper concerns the deterministic and structured designs of the measurement matrix in compressed sensing (CS).

The method is illustrated by the well-known application of CS for fast acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results and performance comparison are provided by numerical simulation, showing that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CS techniques for MRI acquisition in terms of image reconstruction quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread spectrum in chaotic compressed sensing with application to MRI","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2011.6027489","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6022617/6027409/06027489.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2011.6027489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027409","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spread spectrum in chaotic compressed sensing with application to MRI","conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027489/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12272404","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread spectrum in chaotic compressed sensing with application to MRI","confLoc":"Da Nang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"2g079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066249S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6022617","isNumber":"6027409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6022617","xplore-issue":"6027409","articleId":"6027489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6027497,"authors":[{"name":"Takuro Yoshida","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Eng., Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka-shi, Fukuoka-ken, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Takuro","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"38238764100"},{"name":"Daisuke Nojima","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Eng., Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka-shi, Fukuoka-ken, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Nojima","id":"37991373600"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Eng., Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka-shi, Fukuoka-ken, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Eng., Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka-shi, Fukuoka-ken, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Eng., Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka-shi, Fukuoka-ken, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1207-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1206-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1205-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-1020"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-1020"}],"articleNumber":"6027497","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Modulation","Computational modeling","Computers","AWGN","Registers","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","CFO","IQ-imbalance compensator","narrow-band wireless system","direct conversion receiver","in-phase component","quadrature-phase component","quadrature demodulator","carrier frequency offset","register transfer level","RTL design","bit error rate","BER characteristic","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"In direct conversion receiver, I/Q imbalance is caused by non orthogonality between in-phase component and quadrature-phase component caused by imperfections of quadrature demodulator.

By using only four magnetization directions, a figure of merit value of 0.11 is achieved using the proposed optimization method.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2150203","startPage":"4104","endPage":"4107","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06027577.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2150203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Permanent Magnet Assemblies Using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Permanent magnets","Materials","Genetic algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Topology","Magnetostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","magnetisation","permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","permanent magnet assemblies","pixel refinement","computational efficiency","permanent magnet dipoie","magnetization direction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","permanent magnet dipole","topology optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Permanent Magnet Assemblies Using Genetic Algorithms","volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6027577/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12244827","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Permanent Magnet Assemblies Using Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tmag-cheng-2150203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061921S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6027577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6027587,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Young Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280087400"},{"name":"Sung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Gwangju R&D Center, Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281140100"},{"name":"Kyoung-Jin Ko","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Jin","lastName":"Ko","id":"37402255000"},{"name":"Seok-Myeong Jang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Myeong","lastName":"Jang","id":"37277202200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6027587","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1686},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic flux","Magnetic analysis","Magnetic cores","Rotors","Analytical models","Torque","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","permanent magnet machines","stators","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic analysis","axial flux machines","double-sided permanent magnet rotor","coreless stator windings","magnetic vector potential","2D analytical model","electromagnetic torque","magnetic field solutions","equivalent circuits","3D FE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Axial flux machine","back emf","electromagnetic torque","magnetic field solutions","2-D analytical model","3-D FE results"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the experimental verification and electromagnetic analysis of an axial flux machine with a double-sided permanent magnet (PM) rotor and coreless stator windings, based on analytical field computation.

While we discuss several alternative layouts for use with SWD, we also discuss the dramatic implications of observed workloads. Example data access traces demonstrate the surprising stability of written device blocks, with a small fraction requiring multiple updates (the problematic operation for a shingled-write device). Specifically, we discuss how general purpose workloads can show that more than 93% of device blocks can remain unchanged over a day, and that for more specialized workloads less than 0.5% of a shingled-write disk's capacity would be needed to hold randomly updated blocks. We further demonstrate how different approaches to data layout can alternatively improve or reduce the performance of a shingled-write device in comparison to the performance of a traditional non-shingled device.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2157115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06027595.pdf","startPage":"3691","endPage":"3697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2157115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Management and Layout for Shingled Magnetic Recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027595/","displayDocTitle":"Data Management and Layout for Shingled Magnetic Recording","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12244844","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027595/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Management and Layout for Shingled Magnetic Recording","sourcePdf":"tmag-amer-2157115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088817S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6027595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6027603,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

The grain flipping probability (GFP) model has been proposed to mimic the performance of micromagnetic ( \u03bc-mag) simulations for the purpose of signal reproduction. Other work in TDMR includes the proposal of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that produces improved likelihood information at the output of the detector, combined with low density parity check (LDPC) codes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we aim to simulate a TDMR/SMR recording system with the GFP model, both with and without the GMM detector, and with various random and structured LDPC codes, of both 4 k and 16 k block lengths, to determine areal densities that might be achieved. Second, we perform a comparison of the various model order reduced (MOR) GFP implementations to compare the effect of writing with various factors taken out of the picture. Third, we perform a validation of the GFP model and the setup as a whole, by running the system with a parameter set close to that of conventional recording. The results of these experiments give an assurance of the validity of our model, give an indication of the expected density that might be achieved in a TDMR/SMR system, and give a direction for which parameter(s) in magnetic recording systems might be optimized to yield the most gain.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2156770","startPage":"3685","endPage":"3690","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Incorporating Single-Layer Switching via Rashba-Induced Spin Torque","abstract":"We designed and modeled a nonvolatile memory device that utilizes the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to write data onto a free ferromagnetic (FM) layer and uses the tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) effect for data read-back. The magnetic RAM (MRAM) device consists of a free (switchable) FM multilayer stack, in which a large internal electric field is induced at the interfaces between the oxide and the FM layer. In the FM layer, data writing by magnetization switching occurs via the Rashba-induced spin torque, while the data reading process in the system could be fulfilled via the current-perpendicular-to-plane TMR response. A general equation of motion for the local moments has been obtained by formally deriving the SU(2) spin-orbit gauge field arising due to SOC and the critical current density is estimated to be 1.2 \u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n A/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

To realize efficient and low-cost SMC devices, it is necessary to benefit from interesting isotropic SMC material properties such as 3-D flux circulation path. In this case, the best approach is to carry out a topological structure research and perform a global optimization using physical models. However, the iterative optimization process can be computationally intensive and some compromises should be found between accuracy and computation time. One way is to use coarse models with important simplifying hypotheses but the optimal solution is often not valid. In this case, one can perform a limited number of finite element (FE) simulations to compute some correction coefficients and improve optimization convergence to a valid optimal solution. Another way is to perform the device optimization by using directly FE models with low mesh density and several simplifications of the device geometry. Such design approaches are illustrated by three concrete realizations with SMC material.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2157113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06027731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2157113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","startPage":"4384","endPage":"4390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Optimization of Soft Magnetic Composite Machines With Finite Element Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of Soft Magnetic Composite Machines With Finite Element Methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12244972","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6027731/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of Soft Magnetic Composite Machines With Finite Element Methods","sourcePdf":"tmag-cros-2157113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082057S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6027731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6027773,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Myeong Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Myeong","lastName":"Jang","id":"37277202200"},{"name":"Hyung-Il Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Il","lastName":"Park","id":"37595648400"},{"name":"Jang-Young Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280087400"},{"name":"Kyoung-Jin Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Jin","lastName":"Ko","id":"37402255000"},{"name":"Sung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Gwangju R&D Center, Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281140100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6027773","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1113},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Magnetic analysis","Shape","Analytical models","Iron","Mathematical model","Permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","magnetisation","permanent magnet machines","torque","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnet pole shape design","permanent magnet machine","electromagnetic field theory","torque ripple minimization","magnetic vector potential","two-dimensional polar system","flux density","magnetization","nonlinear finite element method","FEM","back-emf measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical technique","electromagnetic torque","magnet pole shape","permanent magnet (PM) motors","torque ripple"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnet Pole Shape Design of Permanent Magnet Machine for Minimization of Torque Ripple Based on Electromagnetic Field Theory","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2151846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","endPage":"3589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06027773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2151846","startPage":"3586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027773","abstract":"This paper deals with the magnet pole shape design of permanent magnet machines for the minimization of torque ripple based on electromagnetic field theory. On the basis of a magnetic vector potential and a two-dimensional (2-D) polar system, analytical solutions for flux density due to permanent magnet (PM) and current are obtained. In particular, the analytical solutions for mathematical expressions of magnets with different circumferential thicknesses can be solved by introducing improved magnetization modeling techniques, resulting in accurate calculations of electromagnetic torque. The analytical results are validated extensively by nonlinear finite element method (FEM). Test results such as back-emf measurements are also given to confirm the analyses. Finally, on the basis of derived analytical solutions, a reduction of torque ripple can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12245008","htmlLink":"/document/6027773/","displayDocTitle":"Magnet Pole Shape Design of Permanent Magnet Machine for Minimization of Torque Ripple Based on Electromagnetic Field Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnet Pole Shape Design of Permanent Magnet Machine for Minimization of Torque Ripple Based on Electromagnetic Field Theory","sourcePdf":"tmag-park-2151846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055037S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6027773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6027794,"authors":[{"name":"Byeong-Hwa Lee","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong-Hwa","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600703700"},{"name":"Kyu-Seob Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu-Seob","lastName":"Kim","id":"38487461100"},{"name":"Jung-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Pyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085347813"},{"name":"Jung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086630745"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6027794","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":737},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Shape","Induction motors","Magnetic circuits","Finite element methods","Optimization","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","linear induction motors","magnetic fields","response surface methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum shape design","single-sided linear induction motors","response surface methodology","finite-element method","FEM","optimal design methodology","magnetic-field analysis","steady-state performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design of experiment (DOE)","equivalent magnetic circuit network method","finite-element method (FEM)","optimization","response surface methodology (RSM)","single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM)"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with finding the optimal ratio of height and length of single-sided linear induction motors using the finite-element method (FEM) for magnetic-field analysis coupled with optimal design methodology.

In this work, we shall exploit a key insight that in the most on-chip caches where STT-RAM is most likely to be deployed, the lifespan of the data stored in the memory cells is much shorter than the data retention time requirement assumed in STT-RAM development, namely, 4~10 years. We also quantitatively investigated the possibility of trading off MTJ nonvolatility for improved switching performance, e.g., the switching time and/or current, under architectural level guidance. We further proposed and evaluated a hybrid memory design technique that partitions the on-chip STT-RAM cache into two parts with different nonvolatility performances so as to better fit the diverse retention time requirements of different data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06027811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","startPage":"2356","endPage":"2359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance, Power, and Reliability Tradeoffs of STT-RAM Cell Subject to Architecture-Level Requirement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance, Power, and Reliability Tradeoffs of STT-RAM Cell Subject to Architecture-Level Requirement","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245040","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6027811/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance, Power, and Reliability Tradeoffs of STT-RAM Cell Subject to Architecture-Level Requirement","sourcePdf":"tmag-li-2159262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057255S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6027811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6027821,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The method involves measuring emanated magnetic field from a line conductor at the ground level and, then, calculating the source position and current inversely. A proof-of-concept laboratory setup was constructed and a series of experiments were carried out for demonstration. This method can handle complicated transmission-line configuration by integrating the stochastic optimization approach into the inverse electromagnetic calculation.

As such it is the most accurate large-scale collection of network topologies available, and includes meta-data that couldn't have been measured. With this data we can answer questions about network structure with more certainty than ever before - we illustrate its power through a preliminary analysis of the PoP-level topology of over 140 networks. We find a wide range of network designs not conforming as a whole to any obvious model.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.111002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6027855/06027859.pdf","startPage":"1765","endPage":"1775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.111002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Internet Topology Zoo","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Internet Topology Zoo","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027859/","publicationDate":"October 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12245336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027859/","volume":"29","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Internet Topology Zoo","sourcePdf":"1765jsac0911knight.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06616S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6027855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"581","xplore-issue":"6027855","articleId":"6027859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6027862,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Kurant","affiliation":["California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (CalIT2), University of California, Irvine, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6027855/6027862/6027862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maciej Kurant received a M.Sc. degree from Gdansk University of Technology, Poland, in 2002, and a Ph.D. degree from EPFL, Lausanne, Switzer-land, in 2009.

However, it has been empirically observed that BFS sampling is biased toward high-degree nodes, which may strongly affect the measurement results. In this paper, we quantify and correct the degree bias of BFS. First, we consider a random graph RG(pk) with an arbitrary degree distribution pk. For this model, we calculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the fraction f of covered nodes. We also show that, for RG(pk), all commonly used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, Snowball Sampling, RDS) have exactly the same bias. Next, we propose a practical BFS-bias correction procedure that takes as input a collected BFS sample together with the fraction f. Our correction technique is exact (i.e., leads to unbiased estimation) for RG(pk). Furthermore, it performs well when applied to a broad range of Internet topologies and to two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6027862/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12245339","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Towards Unbiased BFS Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Unbiased BFS Sampling","sourcePdf":"1799jsac0911kurant.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093051S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6027855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6027855","articleId":"6027862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6027869,"authors":[{"name":"Minas Gjoka","affiliation":["alifornia Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (CallT2), University of California, Irvine, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6027855/6027869/6027869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minas Gjoka received his B.S.

While powerful, these methods rely on the social graph being fully connected. Furthermore, the mixing time of the sampling process strongly depends on the characteristics of this graph. In this paper, we observe that there often exist other relations between OSN users, such as membership in the same group or participation in the same event. We propose to exploit the graphs these relations induce, by performing a random walk on their union multigraph. We design a computationally efficient way to perform multigraph sampling by randomly selecting the graph on which to walk at each iteration. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through (i) simulation in synthetic graphs, and (ii) measurements of Last.fm- an Internet website for music with social networking features. More specifically, we show that multigraph sampling can obtain a representative sample and faster convergence, even when the individual graphs fail, i.e., are disconnected or highly clustered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Social network services","Erbium","Markov processes","Communities","Crawlers","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","sampling methods","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multigraph sampling","online social networks","probability sampling","random walks","social relation","social graph","sampling process","union multigraph","synthetic graphs","social networking features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling methods","Social network services","Last.fm","Random walks","Multigraph","Graph sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2011.111012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6027855/06027869.pdf","startPage":"1893","endPage":"1905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2011.111012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multigraph Sampling of Online Social Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6027869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multigraph Sampling of Online Social Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6027869/","volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6027869/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12245346","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multigraph Sampling of Online Social Networks","sourcePdf":"1893jsac0911gjoka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074263S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6027855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6027855","articleId":"6027869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6028024,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Guo Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jian Guo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279939600"},{"name":"You Guang Guo","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"You Guang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882800"},{"name":"Zhi Wei Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhi Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37277999100"},{"name":"Yong Jian Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology, Sydney, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yong Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37086125864"},{"name":"Yun Kai Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yun Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37675040500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6028024","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6028024","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Core loss","Coils","Magnetic cores","Soft magnetic materials","Permanent magnet motors","Torque","Steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite materials","linear synchronous motors","machine theory","magnetic cores","permanent magnet motors","powder metallurgy","soft magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PM transverse flux motors","soft magnetic composite cores","fixed speed drive","variable speed drive","high efficiency permanent magnet motors","highly matured powder metallurgic technology","SMC magnetic properties","silicon steel sheets","vectorial magnetic properties","electrical machine topologies","drive schemes","PM SMC motors","transverse flux topologies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric machines","magnetic properties","permanent magnet motors","soft magnetic materials"]}],"abstract":"Compared with the conventional fixed speed drive, a major factor that handicaps the wide acceptance of variable speed drive with high efficiency permanent magnet (PM) motors is its high cost.

Because the SMC's magnetic properties are quite different from that of the traditional silicon steel sheets, special efforts have been made on measurement and modelling of vectorial magnetic properties, electrical machine topologies, and drive schemes in order to make the best use of the material.

This includes both nanomagnetic logic, where information is communicated through magnetic fields of nanomagnets, and all-spin logic (ASL), where information is communicated through spin currents. A key feature needed for logic implementation is nonreciprocity, whereby the output is switched according to the input but not the other way around, thus providing directed information transfer. The objective of this paper is to draw attention to possible ASL-based schemes that utilize the physics of spin-torque to build in nonreciprocity, as in transistors, that could allow logic implementation without the need for special clocking schemes. We use an experimentally benchmarked coupled spin-transport/magnetization-dynamics model to show that a suitably engineered single ASL unit indeed switches in a nonreciprocal manner. We then present heuristic arguments explaining the origin of this directed information transfer. Finally, we present simulations showing that individual ASL devices can be cascaded to construct a ring oscillator circuit, which provides a clear signature of inbuilt directionality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06028133.pdf","startPage":"4026","endPage":"4032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6028133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Spin Logic Device With Inbuilt Nonreciprocity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic circuits","Magnetic switching","Magnetic shielding","Magnetic noise","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic anisotropy","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","low-power electronics","magnetic fields","magnetisation","nanomagnetics","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-spin logic device","inbuilt nonreciprocity","digital electronic circuit low-power alternative","nanomagnet storage","nanomagnetic logic","magnetic field","ASL","transistor","clocking scheme","benchmarked coupled spin-transport-magnetization-dynamic model","heuristic argument","ring oscillator circuit","inbuilt directionality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-spin logic","magnetization dynamics","ring oscillator","spin circuits","spin transfer torques","spin transport","spintronic logic devices","unidirectional network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6028133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"All-Spin Logic Device With Inbuilt Nonreciprocity","volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6028133/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245155","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Spin Logic Device With Inbuilt Nonreciprocity","sourcePdf":"tmag-datta-2159106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085725S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6028133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6028140,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Some of the recent HEVs employ electric propulsion systems using a combination of reduction gear and interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) operated by relatively high-speed more than 12 000 r/min, resulting in achieving high torque and power densities simultaneously. In the combination, since all rare-earth permanent magnets are embedded in its rotor core, a machine design of high-speed IPMSM tends to be difficult. This is due to a design confliction between keeping enough mechanical strength of the rotor core and bringing out better electromagnetic performances. To cope with this problem, this paper deals with a 6-slot-8-pole hybrid excitation flux switching machine, in which both permanent magnets and wound field excitation are employed as magnetomotive force sources. This machine has all active parts on the stator body and a rugged rotor structure similar to that of switched reluctance motor suitable for high-speed operation. Some design parameter refinements are conducted to the machine in order to elevate maximum torque capability and maximum power density as much as possible under given design requirements and constraints. As a result, it is demonstrated that the machine designed becomes a good candidate for the target HEV drive application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Power Density Design of 6-Slot\u20138-Pole Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Machine for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2140315","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06028140.pdf","startPage":"4453","endPage":"4456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2140315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6028140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6028140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"High Power Density Design of 6-Slot\u20138-Pole Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Machine for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6028140/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245160","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Power Density Design of 6-Slot\u20138-Pole Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Machine for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tmag-sulaiman-2140315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098664S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6028140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6028143,"authors":[{"name":"Watid Phakphisut","affiliation":["Telecommunications Engineering Department, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Watid","lastName":"Phakphisut","id":"38233098400"},{"name":"Pornchai Supnithi","affiliation":["College of Data Storage Innovation, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pornchai","lastName":"Supnithi","id":"37294848800"},{"name":"Thanomsak Sopon","affiliation":["College of Data Storage Innovation, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Thanomsak","lastName":"Sopon","id":"38489572000"},{"name":"Lin M.

Two- and three-input circuits that consist of two and three MTJs connected in parallel, respectively, were fabricated and are compared. The direct communication is realized by connecting the output in series with the input and applying voltage across the series connections. The logic circuit relies on the fact that a change in resistance at the input modulates the voltage that is needed to supply the critical current for spin-transfer torque switching the output. The change in the resistance at the input resulted in a voltage swing of 50-200 mV and 250-300 mV for the closest input states for the three and two input designs, respectively. The two input logic gate realizes the AND, NAND, NOR, and OR logic functions. The three-input logic function realizes the majority, AND, NAND, NOR, and OR logic operations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06028204.pdf","startPage":"2970","endPage":"2973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2158527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2158527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6028204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction Logic Architecture for Realization of Simultaneous Computation and Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Switches","Logic gates","Junctions","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critical currents","logic gates","magnetic logic","magnetic tunnelling","NAND circuits","NOR circuits","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic tunnel junction logic architecture","magnetic tunnel junction-based circuit","three-input circuits","two-input circuits","series connections","logic circuit","critical current","spin-transfer torque switching","resistance","logic gate","OR logic functions","NOR logic functions","three-input logic function","NAND logic functions","AND logic functions","AND logic operation","NAND logic operation","OR logic operation","NOR logic operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic logic","magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","spin logic","spin-polarized current","spin-torque transfer (STT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6028204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction Logic Architecture for Realization of Simultaneous Computation and Communication","volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6028204/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12261811","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction Logic Architecture for Realization of Simultaneous Computation and Communication","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2158527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044812S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6028204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6028206,"authors":[{"name":"Junhua Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Junhua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406475700"},{"name":"S.

In this paper, a prototype with square planar spiral structure based on witricity is proposed. To compute the resonant frequency, an equivalent circuit model is presented and simulated. The impedance matrix is computed by using a formula method and a 3-D finite-element method (FEM) of eddy-current magnetic field. The results indicate that the numerical method has a better accuracy. In order to reduce the resonant frequency, different conditions are analyzed quantitatively to study the relationship between the parameters and the relation of the prototypes with their resonant frequencies. The findings are found to offer a solid foundation for the optimization of witricity prototypes.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2147768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6027540/06028263.pdf","startPage":"3200","endPage":"3203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2147768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6027540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Analysis of a Wireless Power Transfer Cell With Planar Spiral Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6028263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6028263/","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Analysis of a Wireless Power Transfer Cell With Planar Spiral Structures","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245253","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6028263/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Analysis of a Wireless Power Transfer Cell With Planar Spiral Structures","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhang-2147768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048721S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6027540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6027540","articleId":"6028263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6028292,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The purpose was to achieve comparable performance in terms of voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) and sidelobe levels during scanning to conventional full-size periodic phased arrays of linear half-wave dipoles. This design technique is applicable in cases where the desire for aperture miniaturization takes precedence over the reduction in gain that comes as a consequence. As one of the design criteria, the same number of antenna elements was maintained and tightly packed into a smaller aperture area. This allowed the antenna elements to be driven by lower-power transmitting modules for a given effective radiated power (ERP), compared to a thinned array with the same aperture size. This method also provides flexibility in controlling the self impedance of individual elements and the mutual coupling among array elements. It is hence capable of evolving compact array configurations with meander-line dipole elements that have well-behaved driving-point impedances and low sidelobe levels over a prescribed scan range. In order to overcome the optimization difficulty of arrays with a large number of antenna elements, orthogonal design with quantization (OD/Q) was employed for this mixed-valued optimization problem to generate relatively fit particles at the initialization stage. Several design examples were considered with parallel or planar grids, and with identical or different element configurations. Included among these examples was a design with 32 identical elements that achieved a 42% array-length reduction and a 16% element-size reduction, while providing a relative sidelobe level less than -10 dB and a VSWR less than 2:1 for each element over the scan range of \u00b130\u00b0 from broadside.","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2011.6028421","startPage":"42","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/6028403/06028421.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2011.6028421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniature Meander-Line Dipole Antenna Arrays, Designed via an Orthogonal-Array-Initialized Hybrid Particle-Swarm Optimizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Optimization","Statistical analysis","Dipole arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","dipole antenna arrays","linear antenna arrays","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature meander-line dipole antenna","orthogonal-array-initialized hybrid particle-swarm optimizer","aperiodic linear phased arrays","optimum meander-wire shape","optimal element spacing","voltage standing-wave ratio","sidelobe levels","conventional full-size periodic phased arrays","linear half-wave dipoles","effective radiated power","self impedance","mutual coupling","array elements","compact array configurations","orthogonal design with quantization","mixed-valued optimization problem","planar grids","parallel grids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","phased arrays","optimization methods","dipole arrays","statistics","antenna array miniaturization","meander-line dipoles","orthogonal arrays","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6028421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Miniature Meander-Line Dipole Antenna Arrays, Designed via an Orthogonal-Array-Initialized Hybrid Particle-Swarm Optimizer","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6028421/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12245455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniature Meander-Line Dipole Antenna Arrays, Designed via an Orthogonal-Array-Initialized Hybrid Particle-Swarm Optimizer","sourcePdf":"0018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0954S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"6028403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6028403","articleId":"6028421","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6028465,"authors":[{"name":"Carsten H.

Firstly, to enable the application of the new feature representation of the framework, Iterative Closet Point (ICP) is utilized as preprocessing to detect the nose tip by aligning a pair of symmetrical 3D face models of the same person, crop the interest of region, and then generate the corresponding depth images. Secondly, multi-scales and multi-orientations Gabor Wavelet Transform is proposed for feature representation. Then, LBP operator is used to describe the local features future. For each face region, the statistical histogram is utilized to represent the 3D face accordingly. Finally, LSDA based strategy is presented to address the recognition task. The new algorithm benefits mostly from two aspects: One aspect is that Gabor wavelets are promoted for their useful properties, such as invariance to illumination, rotation, scale and translations, in feature extraction.

Finally, the validity and efficiency of the presented algorithm are demonstrated by network experiment.

Synthesized views are generated through a depth image-based rendering (DIBR) process. This process induces new types of artifacts whose impact on visual quality has to be identified considering various contexts of use. While visual quality assessment has been the subject of many studies in the last 20 years, there are still some unanswered questions regarding new technological improvement. DIBR is bringing new challenges mainly because it deals with geometric distortions. This paper considers the DIBR-based synthesized view evaluation problem. Different experiments have been carried out. They question the protocols of subjective assessment and the reliability of the objective quality metrics in the context of 3DTV, in these specific conditions (DIBR-based synthesized views), and they consist in assessing seven different view synthesis algorithms through subjective and objective measurements. Results show that usual metrics are not sufficient for assessing 3-D synthesized views, since they do not correctly render human judgment. Synthesized views contain specific artifacts located around the disoccluded areas, but usual metrics seem to be unable to express the degree of annoyance perceived in the whole image. This study provides hints for a new objective measure. Two approaches are proposed: the first one is based on the analysis of the shifts of the contours of the synthesized view; the second one is based on the computation of a mean SSIM score of the disoccluded areas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6045637/06029277.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2166245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2166245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a New Quality Metric for 3-D Synthesized View Assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Measurement","Context","Extrapolation","Protocols","Reliability","Stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","rendering (computer graphics)","stereo image processing","three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D synthesized view assessment","3DTV technology","synthesized views evaluation","depth image-based rendering process","visual quality assessment","geometric distortions","DIBR-based synthesized view evaluation problem","objective quality metrics","view synthesis algorithms","disoccluded areas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth image-based rendering (DIBR)","multi-view","quality assessment","quality metrics","video plus depth","view synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards a New Quality Metric for 3-D Synthesized View Assessment","volume":"5","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6029277/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300646","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a New Quality Metric for 3-D Synthesized View Assessment","sourcePdf":"jstsp-bosc-2166245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156843S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6045637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6045637","articleId":"6029277","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6029278,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Meng","affiliation":["CGGVeritas, LLC, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6130608/6029278/6029278-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia (Jasmine) Meng (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Houston, Houston, TX, in 2010.","Her research interests are the framework of compressive sensing and implementation for communication and signal processing."]},"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Meng","id":"37411340700"},{"name":"Wotao Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6130608/6029278/6029278-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wotao Yin received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in operations research from Columbia University, New York, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","Since 2006, he has been with the faculty of the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX.

Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in OFDM, since high-resolution channel estimation can significantly improve the equalization at the receiver and consequently enhance the communication performances. In this paper, we propose a system with an asymmetric digital-to-analog converter/analog-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) pair and formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem. By skillfully designing pilots and taking advantages of the sparsity of the channel impulse response, the proposed system realizes high-resolution channel estimation at a low cost. The pilot design, the use of a high-speed DAC and a regular-speed ADC, and the estimation algorithm tailored for channel estimation distinguish the proposed approach from the existing estimation approaches. We theoretically show that in the proposed system, a N-resolution channel can be faithfully obtained with an ADC speed at M=O(S\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nlog(N/S)), where N is also the DAC speed and S is the channel impulse response sparsity. Since S is small and increasing the DAC speed to N >; M is relatively cheap, we obtain a high-resolution channel at a low cost. We also present a novel estimator that is both faster and more accurate than the typical l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization. In the numerical experiments, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different SNRs and let the transmitter DAC run at 16 times the speed of the receiver ADC for estimating channels at the 16 \u00d7 resolution. While there is no similar approaches (for asymmetric DAC/ADC pairs) to compare with, we derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6130608/06029278.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2169649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing Based High-Resolution Channel Estimation for OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Sensors","Receivers","Estimation","Convolution","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","channel estimation","digital-analogue conversion","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","radio networks","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","high-resolution channel estimation","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","next-generation wireless communication","asymmetric digital-to-analog converter/analog-to-digital converter","DAC/ADC","N-resolution channel","channel impulse response sparsity","Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","compressive sensing","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing Based High-Resolution Channel Estimation for OFDM System","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6029278/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471853","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing Based High-Resolution Channel Estimation for OFDM System","sourcePdf":"jstsp-han-2169649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104478S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6130608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6130608","articleId":"6029278","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6029282,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Leung","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Leung","id":"37893298100"},{"name":"Chi On Chui","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chi On","lastName":"Chui","id":"38237358100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6029282","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1821},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Computational modeling","Performance evaluation","Resource description framework","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","MOSFET","technology CAD (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inversion-mode","junctionless FinFET","line edge roughness","variability impact","technology computer-aided design simulations","high-performance logic","threshold voltage fluctuations","drive current","leakage current","subthreshold swing","root-mean-square LER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FinFET","junctionless","line edge roughness (LER)","variability"]}],"abstract":"We investigated the variability impact of line edge roughness (LER) on standard inversion-mode (IM) and junctionless FinFETs (JL-FinFET) designed for the 2009 ITRS high-performance logic 32-, 21-, and 15-nm nodes using technology computer-aided design simulations. Fluctuations in threshold voltage, drive current, leakage current, subthreshold swing, and drain-induced barrier lowering were found to be significantly worse in junctionless devices compared to IM devices at root-mean-square LER amplitudes up to 1 nm. We invoke a simple physical argument to explain these findings based on the operating principles of IM and junctionless devices and the specific means by which LER affects both device architectures.

The provided analyses are applicable for multipath channels with any number of taps and the Nakagami-m fading parameter can be finite or infinite. The results obtained demonstrate that the Gaussian approximation (GA) can be inaccurate if the number of channel taps is less than five. The analytical results confirmed by simulation demonstrated that the probability distribution functions for infinite fading parameter m are substantially different from those where m is finite. It was also found that the effect of m depends on the number of multipath components L. For even values of L, increasing m decreases the BER while the opposite happens for odd L values. Therefore, the worst case scenario for even L values occurs for m = 1, while for odd L values it occurs for m = \u221e, i.e., the amplitudes of the multipath components are constants and equal.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2011.2165007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6069619/06029296.pdf","startPage":"895","endPage":"901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2011.2165007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate BER Analysis of OFDM Systems Over Static Frequency-Selective Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029296/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate BER Analysis of OFDM Systems Over Static Frequency-Selective Multipath Fading Channels","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376349","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029296/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate BER Analysis of OFDM Systems Over Static Frequency-Selective Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tbc-aldweik-2165007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105721S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6069619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6069619","articleId":"6029296","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6029297,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6069619/6029297/6029297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Chen (M'90\u2013SM'97\u2013F'08) obtained his B.Eng. degree from the East China Petroleum Institute, Dongying, China, in January 1982, and his Ph.D. degree from the City University, London, in September 1986, both in control engineering.

The study is based on real measurements of PLC connectivity across the low-voltage sections of transformers in a representative set of secondary substations. The results show that there is not a general rule indicating the quality of the PLC channel among secondary windings of distribution transformers in a secondary substation and, consequently, there is no general solution based in pre-existing information. Following this conclusion, a strategy is defined to maximize the performance of the PLC system, based on the PRIME PLC specification. This strategy is based in the use of a base node connected to one of the low-voltage panels, together with auxiliary nodes connected to the remaining low-voltage panels, and interconnecting all of the elements (base node and auxiliary devices) by means of non-PLC technologies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power line communications","Power distribution","Communication channels","Substations","Power transformers","Smart grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","power meters","power transformers","substations","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal injection strategies","smart metering network deployment","multitransformer secondary substations","power-line communications metering signals","distribution transformers secondary windings","base node","auxiliary devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling","distribution transformers","injection","power distribution","power-line communications (PLC)","power\u2013line intelligent metering evolution (PRIME)","smart grids","smart metering"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165737","startPage":"2855","endPage":"2861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06029303.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Injection Strategies for Smart Metering Network Deployment in Multitransformer Secondary Substations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Signal Injection Strategies for Smart Metering Network Deployment in Multitransformer Secondary Substations","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12288257","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","volume":"26","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029303/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Injection Strategies for Smart Metering Network Deployment in Multitransformer Secondary Substations","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-sendin-2165737-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092496S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6029303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6029330,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Bracikowski","affiliation":["Communaute d'Universites et d'Etablissements Lille Nord de France, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Hauts-de-France, FR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/6029330/6029330-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Bracikowski received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9s, Universit\u00e9 d'Artois, B\u00e9thune, France, and the Ph.D. degree from the Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Power Electronics (L2EP), \u00c9cole Centrale de Lille, Universit\u00e9 Nord de France, Lille, France.","His research interests include optimal design of electrical machine, multiphysics modeling, and lumped models."]},"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Bracikowski","id":"37946529900"},{"name":"Michel Hecquet","affiliation":["Communaute d'Universites et d'Etablissements Lille Nord de France, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Hauts-de-France, FR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/6029330/6029330-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Michel Hecquet received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Lille, Lille, France, in 1995.

First, the unknown nonlinear system is identified based on the ESN with input-output training and testing samples. Then, the resulting nonconvex optimization problem associated with nonlinear MPC is decomposed via Taylor expansion. To estimate the higher order unknown term resulted from the decomposition, an online supervised learning algorithm is developed. Next, the SDN is applied for solving the relaxed convex optimization problem to compute the optimal control actions over the predicted horizon. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach. The proposed RNN-based approach has many desirable properties such as global convergence and low complexity. It is shown that the RNN-based nonlinear MPC scheme is effective and potentially suitable for real-time MPC implementation in many applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control of Unknown Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2169636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6175217/06029334.pdf","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2169636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6175217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control of Unknown Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6029334/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12638416","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control of Unknown Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2169636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093914S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"6029334","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6029337,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Behbahani","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/6029337/6029337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saeed Behbahani received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Mechanical Engineering Department, Amir Kabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2007.","He was a Professor at the Shahid Chamran University of Ahwaz for five years.

The solution requires concurrent and integrated methodologies and tools based on the latest theories. The experience on natural evolution of an engineering system indicates that the system topology evolves at a much slower rate than the parametric values. This paper proposes a two-loop evolutionary tool, using a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP) for design optimization of a mechatronic system. Specifically, GP is used for topology optimization, while GA is responsible for finding the elite solution within each topology proposed by GP. A memory feature is incorporated with the GP process to avoid the generation of repeated topologies, a common drawback of GP topology exploration. The synergic integration of GA with GP, along with the memory feature, provides a powerful search ability, which has been integrated with bond graphs (BG) for mechatronic model exploration. The software developed using this approach provides a unified tool for concurrent, integrated, and autonomous topological realization of a mechatronic problem.

Meaningful efficiency metrics are key for design space exploration to quantify the algorithmic and the implementation complexity of a receiver. Most of the current established efficiency metrics are based on counting operations, thus neglecting important issues like data and storage complexity. In this paper we introduce suitable energy and area efficiency metrics which resolve the afore-mentioned disadvantages. These are decoded information bit per energy and throughput per area unit. Efficiency metrics are assessed by various implementations of turbo decoders, LDPC decoders and convolutional decoders. An exploration approach is presented, which permit an appropriate benchmarking of implementation efficiency, communications performance, and flexibility trade-offs. Two case studies demonstrate this approach and show that design space exploration should result in various efficiency evaluations rather than a single snapshot metric as done often in state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.092011.100157","startPage":"3301","endPage":"3310","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06029342.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.092011.100157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Complexity, Energy- and Implementation-Efficiency of Channel Decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Energy efficiency","Complexity theory","Throughput","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative decoding","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","communication complexity","convolutional codes","decoding","parity check codes","radio receivers","radiocommunication","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel decoders","wireless communication systems","baseband receivers","design space exploration","implementation complexity","counting operations","data complexity","storage complexity","energy efficiency metrics","area efficiency metrics","decoded information bit per energy","throughput per area unit","turbo decoders","LDPC decoders","convolutional decoders","single snapshot metric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","algorithmic complexity","energy efficiency","design space exploration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","displayDocTitle":"On Complexity, Energy- and Implementation-Efficiency of Channel Decoders","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6029342/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425623","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Complexity, Energy- and Implementation-Efficiency of Channel Decoders","sourcePdf":"3301-tc1112-kienle.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054722S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6029342","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6029343,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Liau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Liau","id":"38016170900"},{"name":"Shahram Yousefi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Yousefi","id":"37274288500"},{"name":"Il-Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Il-Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278943200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6029343","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"For the binary erasure channel, Luby Transform (LT) and Raptors codes have been shown to achieve capacity by carefully designed degree distributions for multicasting scenarios. Generalizing fountain codes to multihop networks requires transport nodes to perform network coding (NC). However, if intermediate nodes perform decentralized NC blindly, the statistical properties imposed by the fountain code are lost, and thus, a Gaussian elimination decoder must be used at the sink at the cost of significant increase in complexity compared to a belief propagation (BP) decoder. Addressing this problem, in this paper, we propose a new protocol, namely Soliton-like rateless coding (SLRC), by exploiting the benefits of fountain coding and NC coding over a Y-network. Ensuring key properties of the fountain code are preserved; BP can be effectively applied when transport nodes perform NC. Additionally, the proposed coding protocol is resilient to nodes churn rates. The SLRC scheme is evaluated against buffer-and-forwarding, and the distributed LT (DLT) codes; SLRC exhibits a 5% reduction in overhead compared to the state of the art DLT code at high decoding success rates. Simulations show that the proposed scheme preserves the benefits of NC and fountain coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06029343.pdf","startPage":"3217","endPage":"3222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091911.100189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091911.100189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Soliton-Like Rateless Coding for the Y-Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Complexity theory","Peer to peer computing","Aggregates","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","multicast communication","network coding","statistical analysis","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary soliton-like rateless coding","Y-network","binary erasure channel","Luby transform","Raptors code","multihop network","network coding","statistical property","Gaussian elimination decoder","SLRC","fountain coding","NC coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed LT codes","fountain codes","linear network coding","LT codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Binary Soliton-Like Rateless Coding for the Y-Network","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6029343/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425624","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Soliton-Like Rateless Coding for the Y-Network","sourcePdf":"3217-tc1112-liau.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057482S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6029343","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6029344,"authors":[{"name":"Chiuan-Hsu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6085845/6029344/6029344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiuan-Hsu Chen (S'04) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1975.

By simplifying a three-node relay network to a two node network with the equivalent channel gain, we formulate the resource allocation problem for a cooperative MU-OFDM CR system in a similar form to that for a non-cooperative MU OFDM CR system. With this problem formulation, a rule is derived for performing subcarrier assignment operations under a given power distribution, where the sum capacity optimization is alternated between the subcarrier and power to form a joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm. To simplify the high complexity optimal power allocation algorithm (i.e., the iterative partitioned water-filling algorithm) for the joint scheme, we further develop a simple method for updating the water level when each subcarrier is assigned. Simulation results show that, with or without cooperative transmission, using the proposed method to update the water level achieves a system capacity close to that of the joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm with the optimal power distribution. In addition, if the relay node is at the midpoint between the source and destination, the system capacity can reach its maximum value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Cooperative Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.092011.100197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06029344.pdf","startPage":"3204","endPage":"3215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.092011.100197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Cooperative Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6029344/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388289","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for Cooperative Multiuser OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"3204-tc1111-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064007S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6029344","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6029346,"authors":[{"name":"Guoquan Li","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Guoquan","lastName":"Li","id":"37598711500"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"},{"name":"Yucheng Wu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yucheng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281231700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6029346","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Maximum likelihood decoding","Interference cancellation","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Block codes","Decoding","MIMO","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","maximum likelihood decoding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal zero-forcing PIC group decoding","two-user layered Alamouti code","maximum-likelihood receiver","partial interference cancellation","maximum-likelihood ML decoding complexity","optimal grouping scheme","information symbols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Layered Alamouti code","partial interference cancellation (PIC)","group decoding","two-user MIMO systems"]}],"abstract":"The decoding complexity of the layered Alamouti code with the maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver is high.

We analyze the mutual information and the outage probability of the secondary transmission in a CR system with difference antenna selection, and propose a method of optimizing these performance metrics subject to practical constraints on the peak secondary transmit power and the average interference power as seen by the primary receiver. The optimization is performed over two parameters: the peak secondary transmit power and the difference selection weight \u03b4\u2208[0,1]. Furthermore, we show that the diversity gain of a CR system employing difference selection is an impulsive function of \u03b4, in that a value of \u03b4=1 yields the full diversity order of M and any other value of \u03b4 gives no diversity benefit. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that, in many cases of interest, difference selection using the optimal values of these two parameters is superior to the so-called ratio selection method disclosed in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06029347.pdf","startPage":"3494","endPage":"3503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091911.100633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.091911.100633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Difference Antenna Selection and Power Allocation for Wireless Cognitive Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Interference","Optimization","Mutual information","Receiving antennas","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","probability","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["difference antenna selection","power allocation","wireless cognitive system","CR system","outage probability","interference link","single transmit antenna","diversity order","ratio selection method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","interference mitigation","antenna selection","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Difference Antenna Selection and Power Allocation for Wireless Cognitive Systems","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6029347/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425626","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Difference Antenna Selection and Power Allocation for Wireless Cognitive Systems","sourcePdf":"3494-tc1112-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072933S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6110251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6110251","articleId":"6029347","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6029349,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"},{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37713464900"},{"name":"Haiqiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","School of Computer Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Haiqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716969900"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6029349","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1240},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029349","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Complexity theory","Decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Measurement","Bit error rate","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","parity check codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity X-EMS algorithm","nonbinary LDPC code","extended min-sum algorithm","reduced-search trellis algorithm","M-EMS algorithm","D-EMS algorithm","factor correction technique","Q-ary sum-product algorithm","T-EMS algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMS algorithms","nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","Q-ary sum-product algorithm (QSPA)","reduced-search trellis algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The extended min-sum (EMS) algorithm is redescribed as a reduced-search trellis algorithm (called M-EMS algorithm).

However, some key characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) are still neglected in building these saliency detection models. In this paper, we propose a new saliency detection model based on the human visual sensitivity and the amplitude spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). We use the amplitude spectrum of QFT to represent the color, intensity, and orientation distributions for image patches. The saliency value for each image patch is calculated by not only the differences between the QFT amplitude spectrum of this patch and other patches in the whole image, but also the visual impacts for these differences determined by the human visual sensitivity. The experiment results show that the proposed saliency detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art detection models. In addition, we apply our proposed model in the application of image retargeting and achieve better performance over the conventional algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Humans","Sensitivity","Image color analysis","Streaming media","Algorithm design and analysis","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottom-up saliency detection model","human visual sensitivity","amplitude spectrum","saliency information","visual signal processing","human visual system","quaternion Fourier transform","image patch color","image patch intensity","image patch orientation distribution","image retargeting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude spectrum","Fourier transform","human visual sensitivity","saliency detection","visual attention"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2169775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6130620/06029456.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2169775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bottom-Up Saliency Detection Model Based on Human Visual Sensitivity and Amplitude Spectrum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bottom-Up Saliency Detection Model Based on Human Visual Sensitivity and Amplitude Spectrum","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029456/","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029456/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12471939","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bottom-Up Saliency Detection Model Based on Human Visual Sensitivity and Amplitude Spectrum","sourcePdf":"tmm-fang-2169775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087446S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6130620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6130620","articleId":"6029456","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6029459,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Jong","lastName":"Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Li-Chung Shih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chung","lastName":"Shih","id":"37529569400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6029459","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3172},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Control systems","Uncertainty","Heuristic algorithms","Robustness","Power system stability","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","DC-DC power convertors","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","variable structure systems","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy-neural-network design","voltage tracking control","dc-dc boost converter","AFNNC scheme","total sliding-mode control","TSMC","voltage control","online learning algorithms","control chattering phenomena","Lyapunov stability theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boost converter","fuzzy neural network (FNN)","Lyapunov stability theorem","total sliding-mode control (TSMC)","voltage tracking control"]}],"abstract":"In this study, an adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control (AFNNC) scheme is designed for the voltage tracking control of a conventional dc-dc boost converter. First, the description of the circuit framework of a conventional boost converter and system modeling is introduced. Then, a total sliding-mode control (TSMC) strategy without the reaching phase in the conventional SMC is developed for enhancing system robustness during the transient response of the voltage control. In order to alleviate the control chattering phenomena caused by the sign function in the TSMC design and relax the requirement of detailed system dynamics, an AFNNC scheme is further investigated to imitate the TSMC law for the boost converter. In the AFNNC scheme, online learning algorithms are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability theorem and projection algorithm to ensure the stability of the controlled system without the requirement of auxiliary compensated controllers despite the existence of uncertainties. The output of the AFNNC scheme can be easily supplied to the duty cycle of the power switch in the boost converter without strict constraints on control parameters selection in conventional control strategies. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFNNC scheme is verified by realistic experimentations, and its advantages are indicated in comparison with the TSMC strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2169685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06029459.pdf","startPage":"2104","endPage":"2115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2169685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy-Neural-Network Design for Voltage Tracking Control of a DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029459/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy-Neural-Network Design for Voltage Tracking Control of a DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543566","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy-Neural-Network Design for Voltage Tracking Control of a DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-wai-2169685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049589S","chronDate":"April  2012","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","articleId":"6029459","onlineDate":"26 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6029809,"authors":[{"name":"Fahad S.

Power loss reduction, environmental friendliness, voltage improvement, postponement of system upgrading, and increasing reliability are some advantages of DG-unit application. This paper presents a new optimization approach that employs an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to determine the optimal DG-unit's size, power factor, and location in order to minimize the total system real power loss. The ABC algorithm is a new metaheuristic, population-based optimization technique inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of the honeybee swarm. To reveal the validity of the ABC algorithm, sample radial distribution feeder systems are examined with different test cases. Furthermore, the results obtained by the proposed ABC algorithm are compared with those attained via other methods. The outcomes verify that the ABC algorithm is efficient, robust, and capable of handling mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. The ABC algorithm has only two parameters to be tuned. Therefore, the updating of the two parameters towards the most effective values has a higher likelihood of success than in other competing metaheuristic methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2158246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06029809.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2158246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distributed Generation Allocation and Sizing in Distribution Systems via Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distributed Generation Allocation and Sizing in Distribution Systems via Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029809/","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288264","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Distributed Generation Allocation and Sizing in Distribution Systems via Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-elhawary-2158246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033303S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"457","articleId":"6029809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":6029813,"authors":[{"name":"Mitalkumar G.

Unlike GOOSE, the same SV message is not repeated several times and, therefore, it is important to analyze the impact of SV loss or delay on protection functions. This paper presents the hardware implementation of a typical IEC 61850-9-2-based process bus communication network for digital protection systems to investigate the proposed corrective measure for SV loss/delay. For the detailed testing, various process bus devices (e.g. protection intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), merging units (MUs), etc.) are developed over industrial embedded systems with a hard-real-time platform. The SV estimation algorithm is implemented as a part of bus differential and transmission-line distance protection IEDs, and it is tested for various SV loss/delay scenarios and power system fault conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2159033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6029804/06029813.pdf","startPage":"2587","endPage":"2595","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2159033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laboratory Investigation of IEC 61850-9-2-Based Busbar and Distance Relaying With Corrective Measure for Sampled Value Loss/Delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Laboratory Investigation of IEC 61850-9-2-Based Busbar and Distance Relaying With Corrective Measure for Sampled Value Loss/Delay","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6029813/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288268","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029813/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laboratory Investigation of IEC 61850-9-2-Based Busbar and Distance Relaying With Corrective Measure for Sampled Value Loss/Delay","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-kanabar-2159033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058401S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6029813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6029846,"authors":[{"name":"Benny Akesson","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Benny","lastName":"Akesson","id":"37294537700"},{"name":"Williston Hayes","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Williston","lastName":"Hayes","id":"38196762800"},{"name":"Kees Goossens","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology"],"firstName":"Kees","lastName":"Goossens","id":"37294784500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1118-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"}],"articleNumber":"6029846","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SDRAM","Bandwidth","Algorithm design and analysis","Time factors","Clocks","Memory management","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","DRAM chips","embedded systems","formal verification","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic generation","efficient predictable memory pattern","real-time requirement","embedded system","formal verification","software component","hardware component","SDRAM controller","SDRAM command","error-prone process","DDR2-DDR3 memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["predictability","real-time","SDRAM","memory controller","memory patterns","pattern generation","memory efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Verifying firm real-time requirements gets increasingly complex, as the number of applications in embedded systems grows. Predictable systems reduce the complexity by enabling formal verification. However, these systems require predictable software and hardware components, which is problematic for resources with highly variable execution times, such as SDRAM controllers. A predictable SDRAM controller has been proposed that addresses this problem using predictable memory patterns, which are precomputed sequences of SDRAM commands. However, the memory patterns are derived manually, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process that must be repeated for every memory device, and may result in inefficient use of scarce and expensive bandwidth. This paper addresses this issue by proposing three algorithms for automatic generation of efficient memory patterns that provide different trade-offs between run-time of the algorithm and the bandwidth guaranteed by the controller. We experimentally evaluate the algorithms for a number of DDR2/DDR3 memories and show that an appropriate choice of algorithm reduces run-time to less than a second and increases the guaranteed bandwidth by up to 10.2%.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2011.33","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6029682/6029817/06029846.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2011.33","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","startPage":"177","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Generation of Efficient Predictable Memory Patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Generation of Efficient Predictable Memory Patterns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029846/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6029846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12273522","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Generation of Efficient Predictable Memory Patterns","confLoc":"Toyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"4502a177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036756S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6029682","isNumber":"6029817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6029682","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6029817","articleId":"6029846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6029848,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan F.

On the other hand the data reliability in these systems is being questioned due to the fast growth in flash technology such as Multi-Level Cell (MLC). Recently it has been revealed that the Bit Error Rate (BER) increases exponentially in MLC flash memories as they experience more flash writes. Additionally RAID in flash-based storage systems has an inherent problem, that all flash devices should not reach end of life at the same time. Diff-RAID [2] overcomes the said problem. However, Diff-RAID mechanism suffers from drastic age-variation especially during the first few replacements, a problem that has been identified and addressed in this research. A new reliability enhancement mechanism for high-assurance MLC flash-based storage systems has been proposed here, and is compared with published Diff-RAID results. Our mechanism has shown promising results. In terms of convergence, the proposed scheme is 7 times faster. Furthermore, no single device crosses 66% of the age (i.e. max. erasure cycles), unlike the Diff-RAID where in the first few replacements, few devices reach 70-80% of age, which is great improvement in terms of data reliability.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2011.58","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6029682/6029817/06029848.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2011.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliability Enhancement Mechanism for High-Assurance MLC Flash-Based Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029848/","displayDocTitle":"A Reliability Enhancement Mechanism for High-Assurance MLC Flash-Based Storage Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029848/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12273524","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliability Enhancement Mechanism for High-Assurance MLC Flash-Based Storage Systems","confLoc":"Toyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"4502a190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062178S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6029682","isNumber":"6029817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6029682","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6029817","articleId":"6029848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6029896,"authors":[{"name":"Ondrej \u0160pinka","firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"\u0160pinka"},{"name":"Zdenek Hanz\u00b4lek","firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Hanz\u00b4lek"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1118-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"}],"articleNumber":"6029896","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Navigation","Power demand","Signal processing algorithms","Switches","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aerospace robotics","aircraft control","energy conservation","energy consumption","mobile robots","path planning","power aware computing","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware navigation","unmanned aerial vehicle","vehicle navigation","vehicle guidance","performance evaluation","energy consumption","energy-aware computing scheme","autonomous unmanned aircraft control","autonomous unmanned aircraft navigation","autonomous unmanned aircraft guidance","nondemanding algorithm","energy conservation","microUAV","on-board computer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Systems","Navigation","Control and Guidance Algorithms","Energy-Aware Computing","Embedded Systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents two ways of how to tackle a problem of vehicle navigation and guidance, and focuses on evaluation of the performance and energy consumption of both methods. A simple energy-aware computing scheme, intended for control, navigation and guidance of autonomous unmanned aircraft, is proposed to try to make the most of both methods - providing good tracking accuracy whenever needed, minimizing power consumption otherwise. This scheme is based on the idea of using simple, non-demanding algorithms whenever possible and switching to sophisticated, more accurate control methods only when required by the mission profile. Simple algorithms may be executed in modules with less computing power, allowing high-performance on-board computers (needed for real-time execution of complex tasks) to be suspended, thus conserving energy. This scheme might bring noticeable benefits especially for vehicles in the micro-UAV category, where the amount of usable energy is extremely limited and the portion of energy consumed by on-board computers might be significant (up to 20%, according our measurements).","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2011.22","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6029682/6029870/06029896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2011.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029870","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Navigation and Guidance Algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Navigation and Guidance Algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029896/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12273553","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6029896/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Navigation and Guidance Algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Toyama, Japan","sourcePdf":"4502b083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083364S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6029682","isNumber":"6029870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6029682","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6029870","articleId":"6029896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6029937,"authors":[{"name":"Junling Mao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junling","lastName":"Mao","id":"37596588600"},{"name":"Jinchun Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinchun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37558738800"},{"name":"Yuanan Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411900"},{"name":"Gang Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37305624300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6029937","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Signal processing algorithms","Fading","Receivers","Complexity theory","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","fading channels","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic channel capacity","fading channel","cognitive radio","MIMO","Z-interference channel","multiple input multiple output","transmitter","receiver","statistical feedback","channel state information","interference power constraint","rank constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","MIMO","ergodic capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the ergodic capacity maximization problem is first studied in the fading cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Z-interference channel (ZIC), where the interference from the primary transmitter (PT) to the secondary receiver (SR) is omitted.

With a small modification to the discharging phase of the dual-slope ADC, first-order quantization noise shaping is achieved. This quantizer is used in a second-order loop filter and results in an overall third-order quantization noise shaping. To remove the need for any extra active element, this quantizer is merged with the active adder. In this fashion, the multi-bit flash ADC is removed and hence the loading of the active-adder is reduced to a single continuous-time comparator. Furthermore, to alleviate the speed of the counting-clock and the common-mode biasing accuracy requirements, a bi-directional discharging scheme is proposed. As a proof of concept, the second-order loop filter with the proposed quantizer is fabricated in a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology and achieves over 78 dB SNDR with an oversampling ratio of 24 and 50 MHz sampling speed.

In DSP-FF, the signal and error cancellation circuits are implemented, partially, in the DSP regime. By doing so, the number of bulky radio frequency (RF) components is reduced and their functionality is replaced by more flexible DSP circuitry and also various implementation nonidealities can be efficiently controlled. A two-stage estimation approach stemming from least-squares model fitting is proposed to identify proper DSP-FF coefficients. This improves the linearization performance by decoupling the effects of estimation inaccuracies between the two DSP-FF circuits. Furthermore, a comprehensive performance analysis of DSP-FF is carried out, taking also the memory of the core power amplifier into account. In particular, a closed-form expression for the intermodulation distortion reduction is derived in terms of the errors in the circuit coefficients. Also the measurement noise effects and large sample properties of the estimators are analyzed. The outcomes of computer simulated experiments verify the analytical results which are presented in this paper. Moreover, laboratory measurement setup utilizing a highly nonlinear RF power amplifier and contemporary telecommunication waveform demonstrates the linearization capability of the DSP-FF in terms of improvement in the measured adjacent channel leakage ratio.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedforward neural networks","Digital signal processing","Baseband","Radio frequency","Integrated circuit modeling","Estimation","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","feedforward amplifiers","intermodulation distortion","least squares approximations","linearisation techniques","noise measurement","power amplifiers","radiofrequency power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP-oriented feedforward power amplifier linearizer","signal cancellation circuit","error cancellation circuit","DSP regime","radiofrequency component","flexible DSP circuitry","two-stage estimation approach","least-square model fitting","DSP-FF coefficient","linearization performance","closed-form expression","intermodulation distortion reduction","circuit coefficient","measurement noise effect","computer simulated experiment","laboratory measurement","RF power amplifier","telecommunication waveform","adjacent channel leakage ratio","digital signal processing-oriented implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data least-squares","digital signal processing","feedforward","intermodulation","least-squares","linearization","power amplifier"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163890","startPage":"409","endPage":"425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6139305/06029951.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2163890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and Performance of DSP-Oriented Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation and Performance of DSP-Oriented Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12489719","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","volume":"59","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029951/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and Performance of DSP-Oriented Feedforward Power Amplifier Linearizer","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ghadam-2163890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101623S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6139305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6139305","articleId":"6029951","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6029952,"authors":[{"name":"Vittorio Giammello","affiliation":["Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6077122/6029952/6029952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vittorio Giammello was born in Catania, Italy, in 1981.

However, the classic BP algorithm is time consuming and with a lot of artifacts, which have adverse effects on the following work like detection and recognition. A novel BP algorithm, which is both fast and with good effect of suppressing artifacts, is proposed in this letter. At first, an approved approximation method is used to calculate the position of refraction point with remarkable speed and satisfactory accuracy. Then, a lookup table is used to reduce the redundancy in classic BP algorithm. In order to achieve effective artifact suppression, a cross-correlation-based method is introduced. Experimental results of field data present the superiority of the proposed BP algorithm over its classic counterpart both in operation speed and artifact suppression.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Back-Projection Algorithm Based on Cross Correlation for GPR Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2165523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6145197/06029967.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2165523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Back-Projection Algorithm Based on Cross Correlation for GPR Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6029967/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12509203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Back-Projection Algorithm Based on Cross Correlation for GPR Imaging","sourcePdf":"lgrs-zhou-2165523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042545S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6145197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6145197","articleId":"6029967","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6029972,"authors":[{"name":"Emanu\u00ebl A.

In this paper, a different perspective on frequency-domain beamformers in room acoustics is provided. Specifically, the observed noise signals are divided into coherent and incoherent signal components while no assumptions are being made regarding the number of coherent noise sources and the noise sound field. From this perspective, performance measures are defined and existing beamformers are deduced. In addition, a new and general tradeoff beamformer is proposed that enables a compromise between noise reduction and speech distortion on the one hand, and coherent noise versus incoherent noise reductions on the other hand. The presented performance evaluation shows how existing beamformers and the tradeoff beamformer perform in different scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12470264","htmlLink":"/document/6029972/","displayDocTitle":"A Perspective on Frequency-Domain Beamformers in Room Acoustics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Perspective on Frequency-Domain Beamformers in Room Acoustics","sourcePdf":"tasl-habets-2169786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143111S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6029972","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6029976,"authors":[{"name":"Tibor Grasser","affiliation":["Institute for Microelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6051730/6029976/6029976-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tibor Grasser (SM'05) received the Diplomingenieur degree in communications engineering, the Ph.D. degree in technical sciences, and the venia docendi in microelectronics from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Wien, Austria, in 1995, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute for Microelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien.

Already in early interpretations, charge trapping in the oxide was considered an important aspect of the degradation. In their 1977 paper, Jeppson and Svensson suggested a hydrogen-diffusion controlled mechanism for the creation of interface states. Their reaction-diffusion model subsequently became the dominant explanation of the phenomenon. While Jeppson and Svensson gave a preliminary study of the recovery of the degradation, this issue received only limited attention for many years. In the last decade, however, a large number of detailed recovery studies have been published, showing clearly that the reaction-diffusion mechanism is inconsistent with the data. As a consequence, the research focus shifted back toward charge trapping. Currently available advanced charge-trapping theories based on switching oxide traps are now able to explain the bulk of the experimental data. We give a review of our perspective on some selected developments in this area.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2164543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6051730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2164543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6051730/06029976.pdf","startPage":"3652","endPage":"3666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Bias Temperature Instability: From Reaction\u2013Diffusion to Switching Oxide Traps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Bias Temperature Instability: From Reaction\u2013Diffusion to Switching Oxide Traps","volume":"58","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6029976/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301513","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029976/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Bias Temperature Instability: From Reaction\u2013Diffusion to Switching Oxide Traps","sourcePdf":"ted-grasser-2164543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.236027S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6051730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"326","xplore-issue":"6051730","articleId":"6029976","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6029979,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Blackwell","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Goldsmiths University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6204221/6029979/6029979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tim Blackwell received the B.Sc. degree in physics from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University College London, London, U.K., and the D.Phil. degree in theoretical physics from the University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K.","He is currently a Senior Lecturer with the Department of Computing, Goldsmiths University of London, London.

The relations are applied to three particular particle swarm optimization (PSO) implementations, the standard PSO of Clerc and Kennedy, a PSO with discrete recombination, and the Bare Bones swarm. The simplicity of the Bare Bones swarm facilitates theoretical analysis and a further no-collapse condition is derived. A series of experimental trials confirms that Bare Bones situated at the edge of collapse is comparable to other PSOs, and that performance can be still further improved with the use of an adaptive distribution. It is conjectured that, subject to spread, stability and no-collapse, there is a single encompassing particle swarm paradigm, and that an important aspect of parameter tuning within any particular manifestation is to remove any deleterious behavior that ensues from the dynamics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761205","htmlLink":"/document/6029979/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study of Collapse in Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Collapse in Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-blackwell-2136347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121743S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6204221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6204221","articleId":"6029979","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6029984,"authors":[{"name":"Roel Maes","affiliation":["COSIC Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6126189/6029984/6029984-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roel Maes (S'11) received the electrical engineering degree from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (K.U.Leuven), Belgium, in 2007.

However, the ever growing capabilities of FPGAs and the consequential increasing complexity of their designs ask for a modular development model, where individual IP cores from multiple parties are integrated into a larger system. To enable such a model, the availability of IP protection at the modular level is imperative. In this work, we propose an IP protection mechanism for FPGA designs at the level of individual IP cores, by making use of the self-reconfiguring capabilities of modern FPGAs and deploying a trusted third party to run a metering service, similar to the work of Giineysu et ah and Drimer et at The proposed scheme makes it possible to enforce a pay-per-use licensing scheme which holds considerable advantages, both for IP core providers as well as for system integrators. Moreover, the scheme has a minimal implementation overhead and is the first of its kind to be solely based on primitives that are already available in recent commercially available FPGA devices. This allows for an immediate and feasible deployment, in contrast to earlier proposed solutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","IP networks","Cloning","Encryption","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","logic circuits","logic design","metering","microprocessor chips","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pay-per-use licensing scheme","hardware IP core","SRAM based FPGA design","field programmable gate array","modular development model","intellectual property protection","IP protection mechanism","self-reconfiguring","trusted third","metering service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloning","design security","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","hardware metering","intellectual property (IP) protection","reverse-engineering","soft intellectual property (IP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029984","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2169667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6126189/06029984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2169667","startPage":"98","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pay-per-Use Licensing Scheme for Hardware IP Cores in Recent SRAM-Based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Pay-per-Use Licensing Scheme for Hardware IP Cores in Recent SRAM-Based FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029984/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6029984/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471633","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pay-per-Use Licensing Scheme for Hardware IP Cores in Recent SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tifs-maes-2169667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080577S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6126189","articleId":"6029984","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6029996,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Bin Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280836300"},{"name":"Shu-Hung Leung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Hung","lastName":"Leung","id":"37265751900"},{"name":"Xiao-Min Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238971300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6029996","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The performance analysis of space-time block-coded multiple-input-multiple-output (STBC-MIMO) systems in Rician fading channels for perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) is presented in this paper. Accurate expressions of average bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER) of STBC-MIMO for multiple phase-shift keying (MPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) are derived. Based on asymptotic analysis and Nakagami approximation for Rician fading, closed-form expressions of approximate average BER and SER are obtained for low and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining the error rate expressions of low SNR and SNRs, approximate BER and SER expressions can be obtained for different SNRs. Computer simulation shows that the theoretical analysis is in good agreement with the simulation results, and the approximate expressions derived from the integration of high and low SNR asymptotic analyses are close to the accurate formulas for different SNRs. The asymptotic analysis at high SNR indicates that the coding gain is affected by the Rice factor, transmit and receive antenna numbers, code rate, and modulation, whereas the diversity gain is governed by the transmit and receive antenna numbers. However, the diversity gain will be zero at high SNR in the presence of estimation errors because of the error floor in the error probability curves.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6095462/06029996.pdf","startPage":"4450","endPage":"4461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2169820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2169820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6029996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Space\u2013Time Block-Coded MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Information Over Rician Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Rician channels","Receiving antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","error statistics","estimation theory","MIMO communication","Nakagami channels","phase shift keying","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","receiving antennas","Rician channels","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","space-time block-coded MIMO system","imperfect channel information","Rician fading channel","multiple-input-multiple-output system","average bit error rate","symbol error rate","multiple phase-shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","asymptotic analysis","Nakagami approximation","closed-form expression","BER","SER","signal-to-noise ratios","error rate expression","computer simulation","coding gain","Rice factor","transmit antenna numbers","receive antenna numbers","code rate","estimation errors","error probability curves"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","imperfect channel state information (CSI)","multiple input\u2013multiple output (MIMO)","Rician fading","space\u2013time block coding (STBC)","symbol error rate (SER)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6029996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Space\u2013Time Block-Coded MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Information Over Rician Fading Channels","volume":"60","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408158","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Space\u2013Time Block-Coded MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Information Over Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2169820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044867S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6095462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6029996","onlineDate":"29 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
