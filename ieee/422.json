At present, a reasonably high rate of prediction accuracy has been achieved in classifying proteins into four classes in the SCOP database according to their primary amino acid sequences. However, for further classification into fine-grained folding categories, especially when the number of possible folding patterns as those defined in the SCOP database is large, it is still quite a challenge. In our previous work, we have proposed a two-level classification strategy called hierarchical learning architecture (HLA) using neural networks and two indirect coding features to differentiate proteins according to their classes and folding patterns, which achieved an accuracy rate of 65.5%. In this paper, we use a combinatorial fusion technique to facilitate feature selection and combination for improving predictive accuracy in protein structure classification. When applying various criteria in combinatorial fusion to the protein fold prediction approach using neural networks with HLA and the radial basis function network (RBFN), the resulting classification has an overall prediction accuracy rate of 87% for four classes and 69.6% for 27 folding categories. These rates are significantly higher than the accuracy rate of 56.5% previously obtained by Ding and Dubchak. Our results demonstrate that data fusion is a viable method for feature selection and combination in the prediction and classification of protein structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/4220621/04220633.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2007.897482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2007.897482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4220633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Selection and Combination Criteria for Improving Accuracy in Protein Structure Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Accuracy","Neural networks","Amino acids","Control engineering","Computer science","Bioinformatics","Spatial databases","Radial basis function networks","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","molecular biophysics","prediction theory","proteins","radial basis function networks","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","combination criteria","protein structure prediction","bioinformatics","SCOP database","primary amino acid sequences","fine-grained folding","two-level classification","hierarchical learning architecture","neural networks","indirect coding","combinatorial fusion technique","radial basis function network","data fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combinatorial fusion analysis (CFA)","data fusion","diversity rank/score graph","hierarchical learning architecture (HLA)","neural network (NN)","protein structure prediction","radical basis function network (RBFN)","rank/score functions"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Databases, Protein","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Chemical","Models, Molecular","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Proteins","Proteins","Proteins","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Sequence Analysis, Protein"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection and Combination Criteria for Improving Accuracy in Protein Structure Prediction","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4220633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9569856","pubMedId":"17695755","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection and Combination Criteria for Improving Accuracy in Protein Structure Prediction","sourcePdf":"06tnb02-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125354S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"4220621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4220621","articleId":"4220633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4220645,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4220644/4220645/4220645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chung-Ju Chang (S'81\u2013M'85\u2013SM'94\u2013F'06) was born in Taiwan, R.O.C., in August 1950.

Airport capacity management (ACM) in a dynamic environment is crucial for the optimal operation of an airport. This paper reports on a novel method to attack this dynamic problem by integrating the concept of receding horizon control (RHC) into a genetic algorithm (GA). A mathematical model is set up for the dynamic ACM problem in a multiairport system where flights can be redirected between airports. A GA is then designed from an RHC point of view. Special attention is paid on how to choose those parameters related to the receding horizon and terminal penalty. A simulation study shows that the new RHC-based GA proposed in this paper is effective and efficient to solve the ACM problem in a dynamic multiairport environment","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2006.890067","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4220644/04220654.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2006.890067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiairport Capacity Management: Genetic Algorithm With Receding Horizon","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiairport Capacity Management: Genetic Algorithm With Receding Horizon","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9490283","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4220654/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiairport Capacity Management: Genetic Algorithm With Receding Horizon","sourcePdf":"08tits02-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119605S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4220644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4220644","articleId":"4220654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4220656,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Kul Ki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4220644/4220656/4220656-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Kul Ki (M'04) received the B.S. degree in electronics from Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea, in 1992 and the M.S. degree in software engineering from Korea University, Seoul, in 2003.

A promising way to overcome this problem is to detect driver distraction and adapt in-vehicle systems accordingly to mitigate such distractions. To realize this strategy, this paper applied support vector machines (SVMs), which is a data mining method, to develop a real-time approach for detecting cognitive distraction using drivers' eye movements and driving performance data. Data were collected in a simulator experiment in which ten participants interacted with an IVIS while driving. The data were used to train and test both SVM and logistic regression models, and three different model characteristics were investigated: how distraction was defined, which data were input to the model, and how the input data were summarized. The results show that the SVM models were able to detect driver distraction with an average accuracy of 81.1%, outperforming more traditional logistic regression models. The best performing model (96.1% accuracy) resulted when distraction was defined using experimental conditions (i.e., IVIS drive or baseline drive), the input data were comprised of eye movement and driving measures, and these data were summarized over a 40-s window with 95% overlap of windows. These results demonstrate that eye movements and simple measures of driving performance can be used to detect driver distraction in real time. Potential applications of this paper include the design of adaptive in-vehicle systems and the evaluation of driver distraction","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4220644/04220657.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2007.895298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2007.895298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4220657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Detection of Driver Cognitive Distraction Using Support Vector Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Logistics","Drives","Motion measurement","Information systems","Cellular phones","Radio navigation","Satellite navigation systems","Satellite broadcasting","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","data mining","driver information systems","object detection","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time detection","driver cognitive distraction","support vector machines","in-vehicle information systems","data mining","logistic regression model","eye movements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","driving performance","eye movement","logistic regression","secondary task","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Detection of Driver Cognitive Distraction Using Support Vector Machines","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4220657/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9490290","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Detection of Driver Cognitive Distraction Using Support Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"08tits02-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063183S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4220644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"263","xplore-issue":"4220644","articleId":"4220657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4220659,"authors":[{"name":"Saturnino Maldonado-Bascon","affiliation":["Departamento de Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y Comunicaciones, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/4220644/4220659/4220659-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saturnino Maldonado-Basc\u00f3n (S'98\u2013A'00\u2013M'04) received the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Madrid, in 1999.","Since 1997, he has been a member of the faculty of the Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, where he became an Associate Professor with the Departamento de Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y Comunicaciones, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, in 2001.

Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The proposed recognition system is based on the generalization properties of SVMs. The system consists of three stages: 1) segmentation according to the color of the pixel; 2) traffic-sign detection by shape classification using linear SVMs; and 3) content recognition based on Gaussian-kernel SVMs. Because of the used segmentation stage by red, blue, yellow, white, or combinations of these colors, all traffic signs can be detected, and some of them can be detected by several colors. Results show a high success rate and a very low amount of false positives in the final recognition stage.

A components-based learning approach is proposed in order to better deal with pedestrian variability, illumination conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. Extensive comparisons have been carried out using different feature extraction methods as a key to image understanding in real traffic conditions. A database containing thousands of pedestrian samples extracted from real traffic images has been created for learning purposes at either daytime or nighttime.

Due to practical limitations, traffic flow data may be incomplete (partially missing or substantially contaminated by noises), which will aggravate the difficulties for traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, a new approach, termed the selective random subspace predictor (SRSP), is developed, which is capable of implementing traffic flow forecasting effectively whether incomplete data exist or not. It integrates the entire spatial and temporal traffic flow information in a transportation network to carry out traffic flow forecasting. To forecast the traffic flow at an object road link, the Pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to select some candidate input variables that compose the selective input space. Then, a number of subsets of the input variables in the selective input space are randomly selected to, respectively, serve as specific inputs for prediction. The multiple outputs are combined through a fusion methodology to make final decisions. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the SRSP for traffic flow forecasting, whether for complete data or for incomplete data","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Selective Random Subspace Predictor for Traffic Flow Forecasting","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2006.888603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/4220644/04220666.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2006.888603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4220666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"The Selective Random Subspace Predictor for Traffic Flow Forecasting","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4220666/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9490293","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Selective Random Subspace Predictor for Traffic Flow Forecasting","sourcePdf":"08tits02-sun-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104964S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"4220644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4220644","articleId":"4220666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4220667,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Many researchers have used sequential stochastic refinement methods to solve them, where the different cost criteria can either be combined into a single-objective function to find a unique solution, or they can be handled by multiobjective optimization methods to produce tradeoff solutions on the Pareto front. This paper presents a method for solving the problem by the former approach. We propose a systematic method for incorporating the tradeoff wisdom inspired by the circuit domain knowledge in the formulation of the composite cost function. Key issues have been identified and the problem has been divided into two parts: a) normalization of objective functions and b) assignment of weights to objectives in the cost function. A nonlinear, parameterized normalization strategy has been proposed and has been shown to be better than traditional linear normalization functions. Further, the designers' problem specific knowledge is assembled in the form of a partially ordered set, which is used to construct a hierarchical cost graph for the problem. The scalar cost function is calculated based on this graph. Adaptive mechanisms have been introduced to dynamically change the structure of the graph to improve the chances of reaching the near-optimal solution. A correlated double sampling offset-compensated switched capacitor analog integrator circuit and an RF low-noise amplifier in an industry-standard 0.18mum CMOS technology have been chosen for experimental study. Optimization results have been shown for both the traditional and the proposed methods. The results show significant improvement in both the chosen design problems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.882434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4220671/04220687.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"353","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2006.882434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Approach to Automated Design of Analog and RF Circuits Using Adaptive Normalized Cost Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Approach to Automated Design of Analog and RF Circuits Using Adaptive Normalized Cost Functions","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4220687/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9478430","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Approach to Automated Design of Analog and RF Circuits Using Adaptive Normalized Cost Functions","sourcePdf":"11tevc03-somani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119414S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4220671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4220671","articleId":"4220687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4220690,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4220671/4220690/4220690-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (M'02) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a Brain Korean 21 Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

Like NRZ, HSRC-OQPSK uses two-level data decision which enables a simpler transceiver architecture than multilevel pulse amplitude modulations (PAMs), such as 4-PAM and duobinary","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/4220691/04220713.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2007.897852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2007.897852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4220713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Half-Symbol-Rate-Carrier Offset QPSK Transmitter for Bandwidth-Efficient High-Speed Data Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Transmitters","Data communication","Optical signal processing","Phase modulation","Prototypes","Signal generators","Signal design","Bandwidth","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","quadrature phase shift keying","radio transmitters","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-symbol-rate-carrier offset QPSK transmitter","bandwidth-efficient high-speed data communications","quadrature phase shift keying modulation","HSRC-OQPSK signal","signal spectrum","two-level data decision","transceiver architecture","multilevel pulse amplitude modulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth efficiency","half-symbol-rate-carrier (HSRC)","high-speed data communications","phase-shift-keying (PSK)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Half-Symbol-Rate-Carrier Offset QPSK Transmitter for Bandwidth-Efficient High-Speed Data Communications","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4220713/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9480532","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Half-Symbol-Rate-Carrier Offset QPSK Transmitter for Bandwidth-Efficient High-Speed Data Communications","sourcePdf":"17lmwc06-yeo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041042S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4220691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4220691","articleId":"4220713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4220724,"authors":[{"name":"Shiguo Lian","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiguo","lastName":"Lian","id":"37270848300"},{"name":"Zhongxuan Liu","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongxuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289200800"},{"name":"Zhen Ren","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Ren","id":"37289713000"},{"name":"Haila Wang","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haila","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292554100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4220724","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2004},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"A scheme is proposed to implement commutative video encryption and watermarking during advanced video coding process. In H.264/AVC compression, the intra-prediction mode, motion vector difference and discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients' signs are encrypted, while DCT coefficients' amplitudes are watermarked adaptively. To avoid that the watermarking operation affects the decryption operation, a traditional watermarking algorithm is modified. The encryption and watermarking operations are commutative. Thus, the watermark can be extracted from the encrypted videos, and the encrypted videos can be re-watermarked. This scheme embeds the watermark without exposing video content's confidentiality, and provides a solution for signal processing in encrypted domain. Additionally, it increases the operation efficiency, since the encrypted video can be watermarked without decryption.

Generally, conventional hybrid predictive-coding methodologies are adopted to address the compression by exploiting the temporal and interviewpoint redundancy existing in a multiview image or video sequences. However, their key yet time-consuming component, motion estimation (ME), is usually not efficient in interviewpoint prediction or disparity estimation (DE), because interviewpoint disparity is completely different from temporal motion existing in the conventional video. Targeting a generic fast DE framework for interviewpoint prediction, we propose a novel DE technique in this paper to accelerate the disparity search by employing epipolar geometry. Theoretical analysis, optimal disparity vector distribution histograms, and experimental results show that the proposed epipolar geometry-based DE can greatly reduce search region and effectively track large and irregular disparity, which is typical in convergent multiview camera setups. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art fast ME approaches, our proposed DE can obtain a similar coding efficiency while achieving a significant speedup for interviewpoint prediction and coding. Moreover, a robustness study shows that the proposed DE algorithm is insensitive to the epipolar geometry estimation noise.

An action NN is employed to derive an optimal control signal to track a desired system trajectory while minimizing the cost function. Online updating weight tuning schemes for these two NNs are also derived. By using the Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is shown.

Not only should it satisfy delay requirements but power minimization and QoS issues should be handled carefully also. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are more sensitive to these issues where each mobile device acts like a router and thus, routing delay adds significantly to overall end-to-end delay. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the warning energy aware cluster head/virtual base station-on demand (WEAC/VBS-O) protocol, proposed earlier by one of the authors, in terms of average delay, multihop communication and power minimization aspects subject to video traffic. We use H.263 standard to model video traffic in our simulation design. Primarily, we establish a single hop communication between nodes. It is then extended to multihop communication. However, we find that the protocol can support up to 2 hops for an acceptable network performance provided there is a significant number of nodes in the network. We also take power minimization issue into consideration and minimize power consumption by making use of HCB model by applying it within the neighborhood of the node. Simulation results show that this strategy does minimize power consumption and it does not degrade multihop communication improvement. We finally show that the protocol is quite suitable for video traffic as it fulfils delay and other necessary requirements for a typical ad hoc network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4220871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4220871/","accessionNumber":"10391823","displayDocTitle":"Power and Delay Analysis of The WEAC Protocol Based MANET Under Video Transport","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Delay Analysis of The WEAC Protocol Based MANET Under Video Transport","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"28460015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05768S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4220856","isNumber":"4220857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4220856","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4220857","articleId":"4220871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4220898,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Danne","affiliation":["Department Business Information Systems, Heinz-Nixdorf-Institute, Business Computing, Especially CIM, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Danne","id":"37397697300"},{"name":"Viktor Duck","affiliation":["Department Business Information Systems, Heinz-Nixdorf-Institute, Business Computing, Especially CIM, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Duck","id":"37691628700"},{"name":"Benjamin Kloepper","affiliation":["Department Business Information Systems, Heinz-Nixdorf-Institute, Business Computing, Especially CIM, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Kloepper","id":"37691626500"},{"name":"Matthias Tichy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Tichy","id":"37337699600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-8717-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"4220898","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Hardware","Software systems","Application software","Computer crashes","Vehicle dynamics","Automotive engineering","Control systems","Information systems","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime restrictions","self-healing distributed systems","distributed software systems","runtime constraints","AI planning"]}],"abstract":"Hardware failures in autonomous and distributed software systems create the need for self-healing activities.

Exceeding other existent models, the new hierarchical model overcomes the challenges of largeness, complexity, dynamicity and unexpectedness possessed by the ANTS system.

Numerous block ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), have been proposed and implemented, using a wide and varied range of functional operations. Existing microprocessor architectures do not provide this broad range of support. However, the advent of intellectual property (IP) processor cores presents the opportunity to augment existing datapaths with instruction set extensions to add acceleration modules in the form of new instructions. We will present a general purpose instruction set extension to a 32-bit SPARC V8 compatible processor core that accelerates the performance of Galois Field fixed field constant multiplication, a core element of the AES algorithm. This extension will be shown to accelerate AES encryption versus pure software implementations at a small hardware cost. This matches the improvement demonstrated in previously proposed AES-specific instruction set extensions while maintaining a generalized implementation format capable of supporting other algorithms that use Galois Field fixed field constant multiplication.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221006","publicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221005/4221006/04221092.pdf","doi":"10.1109/AINAW.2007.182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINAW.2007.182","startPage":"396","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Efficient Implementation of AES via Instruction Set Extensions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221092/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Efficient Implementation of AES via Instruction Set Extensions","htmlLink":"/document/4221092/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"10291170","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Efficient Implementation of AES via Instruction Set Extensions","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"284710396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150539S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221005","isNumber":"4221006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221005","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4221006","articleId":"4221092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4221100,"authors":[{"name":"Qinghua Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Media, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404136200"},{"name":"Tingting Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Media, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288851100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2847-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2847-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221100","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":127},"abstract":"Wireless sensor networks are usually deployed in a way \"once deployed, never changed\". The actions of sensor nodes are either pre-scheduled inside chips or triggered to respond outside events in the predefined way. This relatively predictable working flow make it easy to build accurate node profiles and detect any violation of normal profiles. In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage. Finally, real time anomaly detection can be achieved based on the profile matching.","displayPublicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221005/4221006/04221100.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"456","publicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","doi":"10.1109/AINAW.2007.148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINAW.2007.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomaly Node Behavior in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Peer to peer computing","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Protocols","Humans","Runtime","Sensor systems","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly node behavior detection","wireless sensor networks","traffic patterns","profile matching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomaly Node Behavior in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4221100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10291172","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2007","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Anomaly Node Behavior in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"284710451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051161S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221005","isNumber":"4221006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221005","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4221006","articleId":"4221100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221161,"authors":[{"name":"Katsuyoshi Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems, Graduate, Toyo University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuyoshi","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37307631200"},{"name":"Hideki Mori","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems, Graduate, Toyo University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Mori","id":"37277104900"},{"name":"Minoru Uehara","affiliation":["Department of Open Information Systems, Graduate, Toyo University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Uehara","id":"37277097700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2847-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2847-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Cellular neural networks","Image processing","Embedded system","Power system reliability","Fault tolerant systems","Energy consumption","Sociology","Noise reduction","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","embedded systems","fault tolerant computing","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small world network","cellular neural network","image processing","embedded system","processor architecture","small links","local connection information","neural image","fault tolerant architecture","majority voting"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AINAW.2007.183","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221005/4221006/04221161.pdf","publicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (AINAW'07)","startPage":"835","endPage":"839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINAW.2007.183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerance in Small World Cellular Neural Networks for Image Processing","abstract":"In this paper, a fault tolerant CNN (cellular neural network) using a small world network connection for image processing in embedded systems is described.

The ubiquitous nature of gene-gene interactions in the underlying etiology of common diseases creates an important analytical challenge, spurring the introduction of novel, computational approaches. One such method is a grammatical evolution neural network (GENN) approach. GENN has been shown to have high power to detect such interactions in simulation studies, but previous studies have ignored an important feature of most genetic data: linkage disequilibrium (LD). LD describes the non-random association of alleles not necessarily on the same chromosome. This results in strong correlation between variables in a dataset, which can complicate analysis. In the current study, data simulations with a range of LD patterns are used to assess the impact of such correlated variables on the performance of GENN.

In particular, we are interested in studying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic markers as predictors of a dichotomous disease outcome. The problem we are investigating is that of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as determinants of the expression of complex diseases. This study builds on our previous work for a single gene testing procedure developed and presented earlier (Matchenko-Shimko and Dube, 2006). As for single SNPs pre-selection (Matchenko-Shimko and Dube, 2006), we rely on ANN sensitivity analysis algorithms to detect potential pairs of interacting SNPs associated with the disease outcome. The statistical test for SNP interaction is computed using a bootstrap technique and is based on the measure of the predictive significance of two SNPs from the change in the ANN error function (SVM regression error) when these two SNPs are removed from the ANN or SVM genotype-phenotype models.

Recently, several structure-based methods have become popular; however, few robust sequence-only methods have been developed. In this report, we demonstrate that three different feed forward neural networks, trained on a variety of sequence-based properties, can reliably predict enzyme catalytic sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report using neural networks to predict catalytic sites, and is the first relying solely on sequence-derived information. Scaled conjugate gradient is used during training of the models. The simplest of the models uses only sequence conservation, diversity of position and residue identity within the input. Surprisingly, model accuracy is largely unaffected when sequence-based predictions of structural properties (i.e. solvent accessibility and secondary structure) are added to the input. A similar lack of improvement is observed when evolutionary information in the form of phylogenetic motifs is included. These results are noteworthy because they indicate that routine neural network architectures can accurately predict catalytic using only residue identity and conservation inputs. However, applying these methods on a per protein basis still produces a significant number of false positives, which significantly reduces the model's utility to experimentalists.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2007.4221230","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221192/4221193/04221230.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"253","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2007.4221230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Enzyme Catalytic Sites from Sequence Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Enzyme Catalytic Sites from Sequence Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9529622","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221230/","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Enzyme Catalytic Sites from Sequence Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CIBCB-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065591S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221192","isNumber":"4221193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221192","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4221193","articleId":"4221230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221243,"authors":[{"name":"Heike Sichtig","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Heike","lastName":"Sichtig","id":"37698274200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0710-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221243","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Humans","Hidden Markov models","Timing","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Machine intelligence","Books","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart machines","spiking neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2007.4221243","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221192/4221193/04221243.pdf","startPage":"346","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2007.4221243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building Smart Machines by Utilizing Spiking Neural Networks; Current Perspectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221243","abstract":"In this paper we survey the current state of the art in spiking neural networks research and outline our approach to building smart machines.

This is a particularly pronounced problem for complex properties. For example, distance metrics are used in many fundamental data mining algorithms including k-nearest neighbors for the classification task. Even the relatively efficient distance and similarity heuristics for large inputs, though, often require processing and memory well beyond linear with respect to the size of the input, and this rapidly becomes intractable with very large inputs. Complex properties such as the distance between two graphs can be extremely costly, but using samples of these large graphs to calculate the same properties proves to reduce memory requirements and processing time significantly without sacrificing quality of classification. Because the vast amount of Web data is easily and robustly represented with graphs, a data reduction technique that preserves the accuracy of mining algorithms on such inputs is important. The sampling techniques presented here show that very large graphs of Web content can be condensed into significantly smaller yet equally expressive graphs that lead to accurate but more efficient classification of Web content","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Data mining","Robustness","Clustering algorithms","Sorting","Computational intelligence","Computer science","USA Councils","Information systems","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","data mining","graph theory","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web content classification","graph sampling","information mining","very large graphs","data mining","k-nearest neighbors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIDM.2007.368914","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221263/4221264/04221338.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDM.2007.368914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"More Efficient Classification of Web Content Using Graph Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"More Efficient Classification of Web Content Using Graph Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221338/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221338/","accessionNumber":"9507145","conferenceDate":"1 March-5 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2007-April 5 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"More Efficient Classification of Web Content Using Graph Sampling","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CIDM-00-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042307S","chronDate":"March 1 2007-April 5 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221263","isNumber":"4221264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221263","xplore-issue":"4221264","articleId":"4221338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221340,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Guo","affiliation":["School of Computer, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37693929000"},{"name":"Lishan Kang","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","School of Computer, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lishan","lastName":"Kang","id":"37275755600"},{"name":"Fujiang Liu","affiliation":["China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fujiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086707868"},{"name":"Huashan Sun","affiliation":["China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huashan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37693786100"},{"name":"Linlu Mei","affiliation":["China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Linlu","lastName":"Mei","id":"37396812800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0705-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221340","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Remote sensing","Backpropagation algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Genetic mutations","Satellites","Multilayer perceptrons","Mean square error methods","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","evolutionary computation","neural nets","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary neural networks","land-cover classification","remote sensing imagery","evolutionary artificial neural networks","multilayer perceptrons","backpropagation","Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus","high-resolution image"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221340","abstract":"This paper proposes a method for the classification of land cover in remote sensing imagery using evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANN) compared against multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with backpropagation algorithm.

This problem is further complicated by the fact that in many cases, outliers have to be detected from data streams that arrive at an enormous pace. In this paper, an incremental LOF (local outlier factor) algorithm, appropriate for detecting outliers in data streams, is proposed. The proposed incremental LOF algorithm provides equivalent detection performance as the iterated static LOF algorithm (applied after insertion of each data record), while requiring significantly less computational time. In addition, the incremental LOF algorithm also dynamically updates the profiles of data points. This is a very important property, since data profiles may change over time. The paper provides theoretical evidence that insertion of a new data point as well as deletion of an old data point influence only limited number of their closest neighbors and thus the number of updates per such insertion/deletion does not depend on the total number of points TV in the data set. Our experiments performed on several simulated and real life data sets have demonstrated that the proposed incremental LOF algorithm is computationally efficient, while at the same time very successful in detecting outliers and changes of distributional behavior in various data stream applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Local Outlier Detection for Data Streams","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","doi":"10.1109/CIDM.2007.368917","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221263/4221264/04221341.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDM.2007.368917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2007-April 5 2007","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Local Outlier Detection for Data Streams","conferenceDate":"1 March-5 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221341/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9507147","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Local Outlier Detection for Data Streams","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CIDM-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090933S","chronDate":"March 1 2007-April 5 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221263","isNumber":"4221264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221263","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"4221264","articleId":"4221341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4221346,"authors":[{"name":"Hongmei Deng","affiliation":["Intelligent, Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Hongmei","lastName":"Deng","id":"37270026600"},{"name":"Roger Xu","affiliation":["Intelligent, Automation, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Xu","id":"37267217600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0705-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221346","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","Support vector machines","Intrusion detection","Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Computational intelligence","Support vector machine classification","Data mining","Intelligent networks","Competitive intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","optimisation","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model selection","anomaly detection","wireless ad hoc networks","parameter optimization","one-class support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection has been actively investigated to enhance the security of wireless ad hoc networks.

Harmonic currents from nonlinear loads propagate through the system and cause harmonic pollution. The premise of IEEE 519 is that there exists a shared responsibility between utilities and customers regarding harmonic control. Maintaining reasonable levels of harmonic voltage distortion depends upon customers limiting their harmonic current injections and utilities controlling the system impedance characteristics. Measurements of current taken at the point of common coupling (PCC) to a customer are expected to determine whether the customer is in compliance with IEEE 519. These measurements yield the combination of nonlinear load harmonics and nonlinear current due to supply voltage harmonics and typically the customer is required to take corrective actions to compensate the harmonics. This paper presents a neural network scheme whereby, it is possible to do data modeling of the customer's impedance and predict the resulting voltage distortion at the PCC if the customer were to take corrective actions.

The first approach of this paper is to apply CSOM classifier for color face recognition. Main variant of this approach has the follwing processing stages: (a) color conversion from the 3D RGB space into an optimum 2D selected color feature space; (b) principal component analysis (PCA) for each resulted color component; (c) feature fusion; (d) CSOM/SOM classification. The proposed system is experimented using the ESSEX database of color facial images; it contains 151 subjects, where each is represented by 20 pictures of 200 times 180 pixels. The obvious advantage of CSOM over SOM is proved. The second approach of this paper is the implementation of a real time CSOM face recognition system using the decision fusion that combines the recognition scores generated from visual channels (R, G, B, and Y classifiers) with the thermal infrared classifier. As a source of color and infrared images, we used our VICE ACE database of 38 subjects.

This paper outlines several reasons why policy-based cognitive radios would be particularly useful for modern public safety, federal non-military and business/industrial applications, especially in the VHF and UHF bands, where 80% of the public safety, federal and business/industrial licenses are currently held. This paper argues that many interoperability deficiencies are directly related to the original approach to spectrum policy and radio frequency regulation developed in the early 1920's, which segmented uses of LMR spectrum into several use classes. It provides a historic perspective to explain why the current status of LMR infrastructure, operations and licensee behavior is a direct result of antiquated policies and technologies still applied and deployed in these bands. The paper discusses the reasons that cognitive radio could be a successful solution for the apparent congestion in the bands. It suggests that policy-based cognitive radio systems operated on a cooperative, shared basis could lower costs of use and aid coordination for emergency responders across both public and private sectors of the traditional LMR user community. We discuss policy reforms and innovations such as spectrum pooling and spectrum portability that could spur new shared infrastructure development and spectrum efficiencies. We suggest several key policy reforms for consideration, including immediate cessation of ongoing narrowbanding initiatives, decoupling of spectrum licenses from spectrum access, and national spectrum management by frequency coordinators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221478.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Policy Proposal to Enable Cognitive Radio for Public Safety and Industry in the Land Mobile Radio Bands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Cognitive radio","Safety","Land mobile radio","Business","Licenses","Radio frequency","Costs","Technological innovation","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","emergency services","government policies","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["policy-based cognitive radio systems","public safety","land mobile radio bands","LMR services","spectrum policy regulation","radio frequency regulation","spectrum pooling","spectrum portability","emergency response community"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Policy Proposal to Enable Cognitive Radio for Public Safety and Industry in the Land Mobile Radio Bands","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869680","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Policy Proposal to Enable Cognitive Radio for Public Safety and Industry in the Land Mobile Radio Bands","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068289S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221479,"authors":[{"name":"Hasari Celebi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hasari","lastName":"Celebi","id":"37410115200"},{"name":"Huseyin Arslan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37279667100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221479","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Global Positioning System","Mobile radio mobility management","Cognition","Radio spectrum management","AWGN","Transceivers","Intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","bandwidth allocation","cognitive radio","indoor radio","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive positioning systems","cognitive radios","location awareness","innovative cognitive positioning system","indoor environments","outdoor environments","hybrid overlay and underlay enhanced dynamic spectrum management","bandwidth determination equations","Cramer-Rao Lower Bound","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","switching mechanism","two-slope model"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Positioning Systems for Cognitive Radios","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.17","startPage":"78","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221479","abstract":"Location awareness is a prominent characteristic of cognitive radio technologies. Realizing such awareness in cognitive radios require an underlying advanced positioning system that have cognition capabilities. In this paper, an innovative cognitive positioning system (CPS) that have cognition capabilities by means of adjusting positioning accuracy adaptively in both indoor and outdoor environments is proposed. Bandwidth determination and hybrid overlay and underlay enhanced dynamic spectrum management (H-EDSM) are two main components that form the proposed CPS technique. Bandwidth determination equations are derived through Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). H-EDSM that provides optimum available bandwidth to the CPS is proposed. A switching mechanism that manages the transition between overlay and underlay spectrum usage modes for the H-EDSM algorithm is presented. Theoretical analysis of the mechanism is carried out using two-slope model. Simulation results, challenges and complexity options for the implementation of the CPS are outlined. Our study reveals the existence of a trade-off between accuracy and complexity in the adaptive positioning systems for cognitive radios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869681","htmlLink":"/document/4221479/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Positioning Systems for Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Positioning Systems for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066751S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221481,"authors":[{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shamik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37288180900"},{"name":"Mainak Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37278542600"},{"name":"Samrat Ganguly","affiliation":["IP and Distributed Systems, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Samrat","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37269680100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221481","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":646},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Space technology","Computer science","National electric code","Laboratories","Game theory","Oligopoly","Resource management","White spaces","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","game theory","oligopoly","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio spectrum allocation economic framework","competitive wireless service providers","two-tier trading system","sealed-bid knapsack auction mechanism","dynamic pricing strategy","game theory"]}],"abstract":"In the future, we can expect to see more dynamic service offerings and profiles, as users move from long-term service provider agreements to more opportunistic service models. Moreover, when the radio spectrum is itself traded in a market- based scenario, wireless service providers (WSPs) will likely require new strategies to deploy services, define service profiles, and price them. Currently, there is little understanding on how such a dynamic trading system will operate so as to make the system feasible under economic terms. From an economic point of view, we analyze two main components of this overall trading system: (i) spectrum allocation to WSPs and (ii) interaction of end users with the WSPs. For this two-tier trading system, we present a winner determining sealed-bid knapsack auction mechanism that dynamically allocates spectrum to the WSPs based on their bids. We propose a dynamic pricing strategy based on game theory to capture the conflict of interest between WSPs and end users, both of whom try to maximize their respective net utilities. We show that even in such a greedy and non-cooperative behavioral game model, it is in the best interest of the WSPs to adhere to a price threshold which is a consequence of a price equilibrium in an oligopoly situation. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed auction entices the WSPs to participate in the auction, makes optimal use of the common spectrum pool, and avoids collusion among WSPs. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate how pricing can be used as an effective tool for providing incentives to the WSPs to upgrade their network resources and offer better services.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.19","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Economic Framework for Spectrum Allocation and Service Pricing with Competitive Wireless Service Providers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Economic Framework for Spectrum Allocation and Service Pricing with Competitive Wireless Service Providers","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221481/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869683","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221481/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Economic Framework for Spectrum Allocation and Service Pricing with Competitive Wireless Service Providers","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085551S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221483,"authors":[{"name":"Petri Mahonen","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"Mahonen","id":"37266541100"},{"name":"Marina Petrova","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Petrova","id":"37266543100"},{"name":"Janne Riihijarvi","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Riihijarvi","id":"37266544100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221483","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Statistics","Geometry","Next generation networking","Usability","Collaborative work","Stress","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","optimisation","statistical analysis","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network topology information","next generation self-adaptive smart radio","wireless network","cooperative cognitive radio","network optimization","spatial statistic model","N-point spatial correlation function","WiFi access point location"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221483","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.21","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","abstract":"The cognitive radio is a strong and promising paradigm for the next generation self-adaptive smart radios and networks. In this paper we study the potential applications of the topology information in a cognitive radio environment. We argue that use of network topology information, including here the geometric relations of the nodes, can bring significant benefits to cognitive radios and networks. We believe that in the case of wireless networks, and especially in the case of cooperative cognitive radios, it is extremely valuable to know more about the network topology than just neighbourhood counts. The topology information has direct usage and implications on connectivity and capacity estimates of the network, and is a key quantity to consider in making of network optimization decisions. As a \"proof of concept\" for out ideas, we present a rather detailed and comprehensive topology information characterization study using spatial statistic models. We introduce particularly N-point spatial correlation functions and demonstrate their usability. Furthermore we report new results on correlated locations on WiFi access point locations as an example.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"103","endPage":"114","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221483.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Topology Information for Cognitive Radios and Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221483/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Topology Information for Cognitive Radios and Networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869685","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Topology Information for Cognitive Radios and Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080788S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4221484,"authors":[{"name":"Youping Zhao","affiliation":["Wireless Bradley Department .of ECE, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Youping","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37403484200"},{"name":"Lizdabel Morales","affiliation":["Wireless Bradley Department .of ECE, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Lizdabel","lastName":"Morales","id":"38559424300"},{"name":"Joseph Gaeddert","affiliation":["Wireless Bradley Department .of ECE, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Gaeddert","id":"37272337200"},{"name":"Kyung K.

According to US FCC's recent public notice, WRAN products are scheduled to be available for the market by February, 2009. This paper first presents a brief review of the IEEE 802.22 WRAN standardization, and then introduces the radio environment map (REM) as an innovative cost-efficient approach to developing and managing WRAN systems. REMs can provide powerful infrastructure support to the functionality of the WRAN cognitive engine (CE). The data model of the REM is presented together with an extensive discussion on how to exploit the REM for a variety of applications in WRAN systems, focusing on the REM-enabled case- and knowledge-based learning algorithms (REM-CKL) for WRAN CEs. Furthermore, REM-based radio scenario-driven testing (REM-SDT) is also presented as a viable approach to evaluating the performance of CEs. Future research topics are discussed in the final section.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221484.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Radio Environment Maps to Cognitive Wireless Regional Area Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","TV broadcasting","Standardization","Environmental management","Innovation management","Radio spectrum management","Power system management","Engines","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication network management","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio environment map","cognitive wireless regional area networks","TV broadcast band","US FCC","IEEE 802.22 WRAN standardization","cognitive engine management","knowledge-based learning algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applying Radio Environment Maps to Cognitive Wireless Regional Area Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221484/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869686","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Radio Environment Maps to Cognitive Wireless Regional Area Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04187S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4221485,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Shi","firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Shi","id":"38270545000"},{"name":"Y.

This concept is examined to see under what conditions BWA could be viable. Rural areas require long range communication which cognitive radios may not be able to support with enough secondary spectrum. Urban areas have less available spectrum and the BWA must use shorter ranges with greater spatial reuse. Furthermore, it is not clear what regulatory model would best support BWA. This paper considers demographic (urban, rural) and licensing (unlicensed, nonexclusive licensed, exclusive licensed) dimensions. A general BWA efficiency and economic analysis tool is developed and then example parameters corresponding to each of these regimes are derived. The results indicate that in rural areas an unlicensed model is viable and the additional spectrum would be useful despite existing unlicensed spectrum. In the densest urban areas the licensed models are not viable. This is not simply because there is less unused spectrum in urban areas. Urban area cognitive radios are constrained to short ranges and many broadband alternatives already exist. As a result the cost per subscriber is high. An unlicensed model is viable in urban areas, however the spectrum needs can be met with existing unlicensed spectrum. These results provide useful input for a variety of spectrum policy issues.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221486.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can Cognitive Radio Support Broadband Wireless Access?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221486/","displayDocTitle":"Can Cognitive Radio Support Broadband Wireless Access?","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869688","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can Cognitive Radio Support Broadband Wireless Access?","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094527S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221487,"authors":[{"name":"Manuj Sharma","affiliation":["Kanwal Rekhi, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India","Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Manuj","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37405455600"},{"name":"Anirudha Sahoo","affiliation":["Kanwal Rekhi, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Anirudha","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37298471300"},{"name":"K.

The public safety band is of interest because of its obvious importance and the increasing need to determine whether improved spectral utilization would accommodate increased usage for public safety. Two receiver suites were synchronized and used to measure concurrent spectra at separations between a few meters up to a few kilometers. These measurements prove useful in examining issues of spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum access, including receiver sensitivity, primary user signal detection, adjacent channel interference, and policy performance with local and cooperative sensing. We analyze the collected data to characterize the usage of this public safety network and provide insights into how white space can be identified and utilized. We propose a class of opportunistic access strategies and demonstrate how collected data can be used to evaluate the performance of such schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221488/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9869690","publicationDate":"April 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221488/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Spectrum Activities in the U.S. Public Safety Band for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Spectrum Activities in the U.S. Public Safety Band for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056099S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4221489,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Cordeiro","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Cordeiro","id":"37277649400"},{"name":"Kiran Challapali","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Challapali","id":"37283381200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221489","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":262,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":2307},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Wireless networks","Chromium","Algorithm design and analysis","Access protocols","Multicast protocols","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive medium access control protocol","distributed multichannel wireless network","slotted beaconing period"]}],"abstract":"A number of algorithmic and protocol assumptions taken for granted in the design of existing wireless communication technologies need to be revisited in extending their scope to the new cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. The fact that channel availability can rapidly change over time and the need for coordinated quiet periods in order to quickly and robustly detect the presence of incumbents, are just some of the examples of the unique challenges in protocol and algorithm design for CR networks and, in particular, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce a novel cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol for distributed multi-channel wireless networks. C-MAC operates over multiple channels, and hence is able to effectively deal with, among other things, the dynamics of resource availability due to primary users and mitigate the effects of distributed quiet periods utilized for primary user signal detection. In C-MAC, each channel is logically divided into recurring superframes which, in turn, include a slotted beaconing period (BP) where nodes exchange information and negotiate channel usage. Each node transmits a beacon in a designated beacon slot during the BP, which helps in dealing with hidden nodes, medium reservations, and mobility. For coordination amongst nodes in different channels, a rendezvous channel (RC) is employed that is decided dynamically and in a totally distributed fashion. Among other things, the RC is used to support network-wide multicast and broadcast which are often neglected in existing multi-channel MAC protocols. We present promising performance results of C- MAC. We also describe our efforts to implement features of C- MAC in a real CR prototype with Atheros chipset, which currently includes the spectrum sensing module and preliminary features of C-MAC.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.27","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221489.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"C-MAC: A Cognitive MAC Protocol for Multi-Channel Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221489/","displayDocTitle":"C-MAC: A Cognitive MAC Protocol for Multi-Channel Wireless Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869691","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221489/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-MAC: A Cognitive MAC Protocol for Multi-Channel Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066221S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"262","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221490,"authors":[{"name":"Shridhar Mubaraq Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shridhar Mubaraq","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37399244100"},{"name":"Rahul Tandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Tandra","id":"37392117800"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221490","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","TV","Microphones","Radio transmitters","Large-scale systems","Uncertainty","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency","Protection","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio systems","spectrum holes","sensor network","admission control algorithm","wireless microphone users","IEEE 802.22 working group"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221490","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.28","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","abstract":"Opportunistic radio systems aim to exploit 'spectrum holes' by finding bands and transmission characteristics that will not cause harmful interference to the primary users of that band. This paper explores whether it is harder/easier to peacefully coexist with primary systems that operate at different scales in terms of their coverage area and transmission power. When sensing a large scale primary, a small scale secondary user can make its own decision about transmission based on the sensing results from its neighborhood. This assumption fails when the scale of the primary is comparable to the scale of the secondary user. In this scenario, we need to decouple sensing from admission control - a sensor network is required to perform the sensing. For small primaries, the environment over which the sensing results are valid is small which imposes certain minimum density requirements for sensor nodes. Collective sensing is used to localize the primary while a separate admission control algorithm decides on which secondaries can safely transmit. Location information of the primary and secondary users is key for such an admission control algorithm to operate successfully. In the case of a large primary, location uncertainty did not impact results significantly since decisions are made about a primary that is very far as compared to the inter-sensor distances. This is no longer valid for a small primary and hence more exact location information is paramount. With location uncertainty of primary and secondary users, the effective primary user footprint can increase significantly. We focus our discussion around a toy model of the Part 74 'wireless microphone users' that are a concern to the IEEE 802.22 Working Group.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"158","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221490.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence with Primary Users of Different Scales","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221490/","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence with Primary Users of Different Scales","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869692","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistence with Primary Users of Different Scales","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059267S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221491,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Chen","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37308411700"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"},{"name":"Gian Mario Maggio","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian Mario","lastName":"Maggio","id":"37274457300"},{"name":"Imrich Chlamtac","affiliation":["Create-Net International Research Center, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Imrich","lastName":"Chlamtac","id":"37269377200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221491","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":179,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1578},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Network topology","Chromium","Access protocols","Media Access Protocol","Peer to peer computing","Ad hoc networks","Distributed control","Command and control systems","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CogMesh","cognitive radio network","radio spectrum","control allocation scheme","wireless ad-hoc networks","spectrum management"]}],"abstract":"As the radio spectrum usage paradigm shifting from the traditional command and control allocation scheme to the open spectrum allocation scheme, wireless ad-hoc networks meet new opportunities and challenges. The open spectrum allocation scheme has potential to provide those networks more capacity, and make them more flexible and reliable. However, the freedom brought by the new spectrum allocation scheme introduces spectrum management and network coordination challenges. Moreover, wireless ad-hoc networks usually rely on a common control channel for operation. Such a control channel may, however, not always available in an open spectrum allocation scheme due to the interference and the need for coexistence with primary users of the spectrum. Instead, common channels most likely exist in a local area.In this paper, we propose a cluster-based framework to form a wireless mesh network in the context of open spectrum sharing. Clusters are constructed by neighbor nodes sharing local common channels, and the network is formed by interconnecting the clusters gradually. We identify issues in such a network and provide mechanisms for neighbor discovery, cluster formation, network formation, and network topology management. The unique feature of this network is its ability to intelligently adapt to the network and radio environment change.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Network","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.29","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221491.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Network","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221491/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869693","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074974S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4221492,"authors":[{"name":"Shridhar Mubaraq Mishra","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shridhar Mubaraq","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37399244100"},{"name":"Stephan ten Brink","affiliation":["Wionics Research-Realtek Group, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"ten Brink","id":"37272165200"},{"name":"Ravi Mahadevappa","affiliation":["Wionics Research-Realtek Group, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Mahadevappa","id":"37332111000"},{"name":"Robert W.

In this paper we explore the use of cognitive technology to enable the operation of ultra-wideband (UWB) devices in WiMax bands. In this particular example UWB devices must incorporate cognitive technology to detect and avoid (DAA) WiMax devices in certain regulatory domains. We start by discussing various options for detection and avoidance. We then describe the obstacles faced in achieving robust detection and avoidance with an on-chip implementation of basic DAA functionality. This implementation is based on the energy detector and can reliably detect WiMax uplink transmissions. Finally, we present empirical results for the operation of a single cognitive technology enabled UWB device with a WiMax system. This interaction also highlights the problem of dealing with listen before speak primaries where secondary transmission could interfere by denying the primary access to the medium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221492/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9869694","publicationDate":"April 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221492/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Technology for Ultra-Wideband/WiMax Coexistence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Technology for Ultra-Wideband/WiMax Coexistence","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053961S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221493,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Ji","affiliation":["Department and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Ji","id":"37278629100"},{"name":"K.

The statistical covariances of signal and noise are usually different. In this paper, this property is used to differentiate signal from noise. The sample covariance matrix of the received signal is computed and transformed based on the receiving filter. Then two detection methods are proposed based on the transformed sample covariance matrix. One is the covariance absolute value (CAV) detection and the other is the covariance Frobenius norm (CFN) detection. Theoretical analysis and threshold setting for the algorithms are discussed. Both methods do not need any information of the signal, the channel and noise power as a priori. Simulations based on captured ATSC DTV signals are presented to verify the methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"202","endPage":"207","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221495.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariance Based Signal Detections for Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221495/","displayDocTitle":"Covariance Based Signal Detections for Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869697","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariance Based Signal Detections for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049388S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221497,"authors":[{"name":"Kyouwoong Kim","affiliation":["Mobile and Potable Radio Research Group, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyouwoong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406163800"},{"name":"Ihsan A.

Detection and classification of very low SNR signals with relaxed information on the signal parameters being detected is critical for proper CR functionality as it enables the CR to react and adapt to the changes in its radio environment. In this work, the cycle frequency domain profile (CDP) is used for signal detection and preprocessing for signal classification. Signal features are extracted from CDP using a threshold-test method. For classification, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to process extracted signal features due to its robust pattern-matching capability. We also investigate the effects of varied observation length on signal detection and classification. It is found that the CDP-based detector and the HMM-based classifier can detect and classify incoming signals at a range of low SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.35","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary Approaches to Signal Detection and Classification in Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary Approaches to Signal Detection and Classification in Cognitive Radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221497/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869699","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary Approaches to Signal Detection and Classification in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069876S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221498,"authors":[{"name":"Artem Tkachenko","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Artem","lastName":"Tkachenko","id":"37294605700"},{"name":"Danijela Cabric","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Danijela","lastName":"Cabric","id":"37271490100"},{"name":"Robert W.

The spectrum efficiency of DSA networks is achieved through the use of spectrum white spaces, frequency bands which are unoccupied at a given time and place. The issue of frequency rendezvous arises as the availability of these white spaces may change dynamically in frequency, time and space. We propose a novel solution to the problem of distributed rendezvous in dynamic spectrum access networks using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cyclostationary</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">signatures</i>\n. By embedding a cyclostationary signature or watermark in a transmitted signal, the received signal can be uniquely detected, classified, and used for frequency acquisition by distributed dynamic spectrum access-enabled nodes in a network. This paper therefore makes three key contributions. First, a solution to the problem of distributed rendezvous in DSA networks using the novel concept of cyclostationary signatures is presented. Second, a low-complexity technique for generating these cyclostationary signatures in OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) waveforms is described. Finally, an initial performance analysis of an implemented test platform is discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221499.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary Signatures for Rendezvous in OFDM-Based Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","White spaces","Signal analysis","Space technology","Bandwidth","Radio spectrum management","Wireless communication","Peer to peer computing","Frequency","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital signatures","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","telecommunication security","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary signatures","OFDM-based dynamic spectrum access networks","distributed coordination","white spaces","cyclostationary signature","watermark","transmitted signal","received signal","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary Signatures for Rendezvous in OFDM-Based Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221499/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869701","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary Signatures for Rendezvous in OFDM-Based Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054098S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4221501,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Nan","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunication, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Nan","id":"37684759000"},{"name":"Tae-In Hyon","affiliation":[" Communication & Network Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-In","lastName":"Hyon","id":"37700127100"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunication, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221501","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Information technology","Technology management","Interference","Wireless LAN","Communication system control","Radio spectrum management","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","channel allocation","telecommunication network management","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio technology","channel management","802.11 WLAN","ad-hoc protocol","control channel","RTS","exchanging of neighbor nodes information","hidden incumbent device problem","HIDP","ready to send","clear to send","dynamic channel allocation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the CR (cognitive radio) technology is gathering more and more attention because it has the capacity to deal with the scarce of the precious spectrum resource. Within the domain of CR technology, channel management of CR is of utmost importance due to its key role in the performance enhancement of the transmission and the minimum interference to the primary users as well. An 802.11 WLAN based ad-hoc protocol using the cognitive radio has been proposed in this paper. It provides the detection and protection for incumbent systems around the communication pair by separating the spectrum into the data channels and common control channel. By adding the available channel list into the RTS and CTS, the communication pair can know which data sub channels are available (i.e., no incumbent signal). We proposed an ENNI (exchanging of neighbor nodes information) mechanism to deal with the hidden incumbent device problem. The simulation results show that by using our protocol the hidden incumbent device problem (HIDP) can be solved successfully.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.39","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221501.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coordinated Spectrum Sharing MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221501/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coordinated Spectrum Sharing MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869703","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221501/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coordinated Spectrum Sharing MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076401S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4221502,"authors":[{"name":"Md Habibul Islam","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Md Habibul","lastName":"Islam","id":"38558160100"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Anh Tuan Hoang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anh Tuan","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38187051700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221502","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Cognitive radio","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Power control","Signal to noise ratio","Power system protection","Interference constraints","Radio transmitters","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cognitive radio","distributed algorithms","distributed control","power control","radio spectrum management","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power-admission control algorithm","cognitive radio networks","antenna arrays","primary network","secondary network","common radio spectrum","beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221502","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.40","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","abstract":"We consider a system where two networks, namely the primary and secondary network operate by sharing a common radio spectrum that is licensed to the primary network.

Here, a master node allocates carrier clusters and their associated power to the nodes in order to minimize the interference temperature, with constraints on bit-error-rate and transmission rates for different classes of services.

The results in this paper include an analysis of a worst case scenario where the primary user and secondary opportunistic user are coexisting with no guard bands separating each other. The experimental results showed that the primary user experienced zero packet loss when guard bands separated the primary and secondary services. Additionally, when no guard bands were used and the spectrum segment was maximally used over the geographical area involved in the experiments, the signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) needed to be adjusted to 20 dB by modifying the secondary user transmissions in order to minimise the interference experienced by the primary user.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"270","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221505.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access and Coexistence Experiences Involving Two Independently Developed Cognitive Radio Testbeds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221505/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum Access and Coexistence Experiences Involving Two Independently Developed Cognitive Radio Testbeds","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869707","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum Access and Coexistence Experiences Involving Two Independently Developed Cognitive Radio Testbeds","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044203S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4221506,"authors":[{"name":"Karl N.

In the search for a solution, it has become clear that several interdisciplinary challenges still undermine the concepts of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). In this paper we take a step back from the technical detail of implementation and focus on identifying the key milestones to the success of DSM. In identifying a roadmap for DSM, we look at the history of spectrum regulation, charting the key events in the transformation from free and open spectrum into the tightly regulated system of \"Command & Control\" that exists today. We outline the similarities between DSM and open spectrum and build on these to present the timeline for spectrum management in terms of a spectrum spiral. We expand on this roadmap, breaking down the key drivers and barriers at each milestone. We conclude that without spectrum scarcity, the concept of DSM is meaningless. But, given that prime spectrum is thought to be scarce, the key remaining barrier to the success of DSM is that of commercial viability.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"283","endPage":"287","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221507.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum: Going Full Circle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221507/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Spectrum: Going Full Circle","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9873236","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Spectrum: Going Full Circle","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065822S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4221508,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjan Pal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Ranjan","lastName":"Pal","id":"37543482000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221508","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221508","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Heuristic algorithms","Polynomials","Broadcasting","Multicast algorithms","Spread spectrum communication","Multimedia communication","Videoconference","Radio spectrum management","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","multi-access systems","Pareto optimisation","radio access networks","radio links","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient routing algorithms","multichannel dynamic spectrum access networks","spectrum-aware data-adaptive routing","single-radio multi-hop dynamic spectrum access networks","link disruption probabilities","link propagation time","combinatorial optimization","Pareto optimal paths"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.46","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221508.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Routing Algorithms for Multi-Channel Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of spectrum-aware data-adaptive routing in multi-channel, single-radio (MC-SR) multi-hop dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks.

For a given amount of data, our routing scheme takes into account the capacity (per unit of time) of the links, the available spectrum, the link disruption probabilities as well as the link propagation time between nodes. We model our routing problem as a combinatorial optimization task with two objectives. Our solution methodology generates Pareto optimal paths in polynomial time as there do not exist paths in general which optimize both objectives simultaneously. We generalize our routing method for broadcasting and multicasting scenarios.

Driven by regulatory initiatives and radio technologies advances, opportunistic usage of the white space can potentially relieve the current spectral crunch. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which secondary users can opportunistically access unused spectrum vacated by idle primaries. In such a spectrum-agile system, a critical and unique issue is the fast and reliable evacuation of secondary users upon the return of primary users. To address this need, we propose an in-band signaling scheme, named ESCAPE. We present the basic design of the ESCAPE protocol in physical, MAC, and routing layers.

We advocate that dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques can be used to enable rights holders reduce or eliminate the effects of externalities through local bargaining. Many of the objections to the promotion of market-based exclusive-rights assignment systems concern the ability of rights holders to enforce their spectrum rights, so as to extract maximal value. In an increasingly fragmented and less-regulated spectrum landscape, there will be an inevitable chafing of rights at the boundaries between the users of neighbouring blocks of spectrum; the spectral activities of one network may impinge on the ability of a neighbouring network to extract maximum value from its exclusively assigned spectrum. Nonetheless, it is argued that it is possible to reduce, or eliminate, the existence of such externalities through the adjustment and exchange of rights through value- extraction-focussed bargaining. In essence, this represents a shift from a mindset of unilaterally enforcing rights to one of mutual remediation of any encroachment. Such an approach may offer a non-Pigouvian remedy to both the under-utilisation and over-utilisation of packages of exclusive rights to spectrum, allowing neighbours to find a tolerable level (a balance) of interference. This paper posits that DSA techniques will have a key role to play in the development of new DSA-based Coasean bargains which will be necessary to address a variety of coexistence issues that will arise between systems operating in neighbouring blocks of exclusively assigned spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869711","htmlLink":"/document/4221510/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Exclusivity, Externalities & Easements: Dynamic Spectrum Access and Coasean Bargaining","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exclusivity, Externalities & Easements: Dynamic Spectrum Access and Coasean Bargaining","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073364S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4221512,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Prabhu Subramanian","affiliation":["State University of New York at Stony Brook"],"firstName":"Anand Prabhu","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37687800400"},{"name":"Himanshu Gupta","affiliation":["State University of New York at Stony Brook"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37270217000"},{"name":"Samir R.

In this model, a centralized spectrum broker coordinates access to spectrum in a given region and assigns short term spectrum leases to competing wireless service providers and/or end users. In contrast to existing multi-year cellular spectrum licenses that span large regions, a spectrum broker can grant spectrum leases that are for small regions (e.g.: per base station) and valid for short durations (e.g.: tens of minutes). Fast spectrum allocation algorithms are crucial to the design of scalable spectrum brokers that can provide such realtime spectrum access. In this paper, we address this challenge. Specifically, we formulate the spectrum allocation problem as two optimization problems: first with the objective of maximizing the overall demand (Max-Demand) satisfied among the various base stations and the second with the objective of minimizing the overall interference in the network (Min-Interference) when all the demands of the base stations are satisfied. We show that the optimization problems are NP-hard and design efficient algorithms to solve them. Our simulation results on sample network topologies show that our algorithms scale very well for large network sizes.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.50","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","startPage":"320","endPage":"330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Spectrum Allocation in Coordinated Dynamic Spectrum Access Based Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Spectrum Allocation in Coordinated Dynamic Spectrum Access Based Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869713","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Spectrum Allocation in Coordinated Dynamic Spectrum Access Based Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091256S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4221513,"authors":[{"name":"Victor R.

Two unique scenarios are examined:(i) the possibility of unlicensed devices interfering with digital TV reception, and (ii) the possibility of secondary users experiencing interference when operating within close proximity to television towers. With respect to the former, we investigate the critical operating parameters for developing the technical rules for device operation in bands adjacent to a digital television transmission. Regarding the latter, we examine, via measurement campaign, how non-ideal transmission properties of television broadcasts, including intermodulation and saturation effects, can potentially impair the performance of secondary transmissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869714","htmlLink":"/document/4221513/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of Dynamic Spectrum Access in Underutilized Television Bands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of Dynamic Spectrum Access in Underutilized Television Bands","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053933S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4221518,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Muck","affiliation":["Motorola Research Laboratories, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Muck","id":"37268160900"},{"name":"Soodesh Buljore","affiliation":["Motorola Research Laboratories, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Soodesh","lastName":"Buljore","id":"37611314100"},{"name":"Patricia Martigne","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Martigne","id":"37298611300"},{"name":"Apostolis Kousaridas","affiliation":["University of Athens (NKUA), Greece"],"firstName":"Apostolis","lastName":"Kousaridas","id":"38571801500"},{"name":"Eleni Patouni","affiliation":["University of Athens (NKUA), Greece"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Patouni","id":"37294373200"},{"name":"Makis Stamatelatos","affiliation":["University of Athens (NKUA), Greece"],"firstName":"Makis","lastName":"Stamatelatos","id":"37293777700"},{"name":"Kostas Tsagkaris","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Tsagkaris","id":"37293771700"},{"name":"Ji Yang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292639500"},{"name":"Oliver Holland","affiliation":["King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Holland","id":"37284761300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221518","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Standardization","Radio spectrum management","Authorization","Distributed decision making","Telecommunications","Research and development","Terminology","Interference","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed decision making","mobile radio","optimisation","software radio","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE P1900.B Standardization Study Group","reconfigurable heterogeneous air interfaces","European Integrated Project IST-E2R II","software defined radio","multihoming capable mobile terminals","multiple wireless links","network reconfiguration management","radio enabler","distributed decision-making","resource selection optimization complexity","cognitive networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE P1900.B: Coexistence Support for Reconfigurable, Heterogeneous Air Interfaces","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221518.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.56","startPage":"381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221518","abstract":"This contribution presents and discusses the system concept approach which has been proposed by the European Integrated Project IST-E2R II in the IEEE P1900.B Standardization Study Group (SG); it currently is under further elaboration in the framework of the follow-up IEEE P1900.4 Working Group (WG) whose Project Authorization Request (PAR) was accepted in December 2006. This effort targets reconfigurable (typically software defined radio (SDR) based) networks and terminals in a heterogeneous wireless environment, with multi-homing capable terminals enabling the users to operate multiple wireless links simultaneously. In order to ensure backwards compatibility to legacy standards, the approach is to introduce three new building blocks into the (existing and/or evolving) heterogeneous landscape: i) A network reconfiguration management module, ii) a radio enabler and iii) a terminal reconfiguration management module. Within this paper, the key functionalities of these building blocks are detailed and discussed; it is furthermore outlined how the introduction of distributed decision-making concepts improves the efficiency of the heterogeneous system in terms of i) signaling overhead, ii) reactivity of user mobile terminals (MTs) and iii) numerical resource selection optimization complexity on the network side.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869719","htmlLink":"/document/4221518/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"IEEE P1900.B: Coexistence Support for Reconfigurable, Heterogeneous Air Interfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE P1900.B: Coexistence Support for Reconfigurable, Heterogeneous Air Interfaces","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06463S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4221520,"authors":[{"name":"Gunther Auer","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gunther","lastName":"Auer","id":"37269753500"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["International University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"},{"name":"Peter Omiyi","affiliation":["International University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Omiyi","id":"37271972600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221520","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Radio transmitters","Feedback","Licenses","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Base stations","Centralized control","Mobile communication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","protocols","radio spectrum management","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium access","dynamic spectrum sharing","mobile communication systems","cognitive radios","resource allocation","dynamic spectrum assignment","BB-DSA protocol","busy burst signaling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Aware Medium Access for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.58","startPage":"399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221520","abstract":"We address dynamic spectrum sharing for future mobile communication systems where multiple operators share license exempt spectrum. In such an environment cognitive radios are needed that are able to sense, as well as dynamically allocate the available resources in a distributed manner and on a short-term basis. In this paper we propose dynamic spectrum assignment (DSA) based on busy burst (BB) signaling. Its basic principle is that receivers upon data reception transmit a busy signal in an adjacent time multiplexed minislot. Through exploitation of channel reciprocity, other potential transmitters are prevented from interfering by first listening to the busy signal. Due to its decentralized nature, the considered BB-DSA protocol appears to be ideally suited for dynamic spectrum sharing in license exempt spectrum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869721","htmlLink":"/document/4221520/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interference Aware Medium Access for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Aware Medium Access for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088866S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4221523,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37691864300"},{"name":"Paramvir Bahl","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Paramvir","lastName":"Bahl","id":"37270007700"},{"name":"Ranveer Chandra","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Ranveer","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37398179800"},{"name":"Philip A.

However, there are a number of challenges in efficiently using the TV bands. For example, the available spectrum is fragmented, and its availability may vary over time. In this paper, we present a cognitive radio system, called KNOWS, to address these challenges. We present the design of our prototype, which includes a new hardware platform and a spectrum-aware Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. We have implemented the MAC protocol in QualNet, and our results show that in most scenarios KNOWS increases the throughput by more than 200% when compared to an IEEE 802.11 based system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221523.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"427","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"KNOWS: Cognitive Radio Networks Over White Spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","White spaces","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","FCC","TV broadcasting","Robustness","Data communication","Prototypes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","data communication","radio networks","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KNOWS","cognitive radio networks","FCC","Federal Communications Commission","TV broadcast bands","robust data communication","hardware platform","spectrum-aware medium access control","MAC protocol","IEEE 802.11"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"KNOWS: Cognitive Radio Networks Over White Spaces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221523/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869724","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"KNOWS: Cognitive Radio Networks Over White Spaces","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"49A.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08297S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":4221524,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To make their spectrum access decisions, the nodes need to communicate with the existing nodes operating in the area. In this paper we propose an approach which establishes this first connection with a minimum risk of interference. We propose a link rendezvous strategy which relies on frequency domain decision statistics. Nodes wishing to join the network are emitting and scanning for a simple carrier with a small number of sidetones. We describe the strategy in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing. To validate our approach, we describe a series of experiments using the GNU Radio software defined radio toolkit. We show that an attention signal of length equivalent to a single FFT frame can be detected in a high noise environment using two sidetones.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.64","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221526.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.64","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","startPage":"444","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link Rendezvous Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Link Rendezvous Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221526/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869727","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link Rendezvous Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047622S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221527,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Motamedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Motamedi","id":"37425062800"},{"name":"Ahmad Bahai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Bahai","id":"37265187800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221527","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Wireless networks","Stochastic processes","Wireless sensor networks","Access protocols","Frequency","Interference","Wireless LAN","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","channel allocation","interference","stochastic processes","telecommunication control","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed spectrum-agile wireless networks","media access control protocol","MAC protocol design","stochastic control approach","wireless LAN","wireless sensor networks","interference","multichannel CSMA-based protocol","dynamic channel selection algorithm","multiarmed bandit problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221527","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.65","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","abstract":"Widespread deployment of wireless networks under different services including wireless LANs and sensor networks in a shared spectrum has caused many interference and performance issues in dense networks.

We advocate that the SS should apply opportunistic interference cancellation (OIC) and decode the PS signal when such an opportunity is created by the rate selected in the PS and the power received from the PS. We derive the achievable data rate in the SS when OIC is applied. When the PS is decodable, we devise a method applied by the SS to achieve the maximal possible secondary rate. This method has a practical significance, since it enables rate adaptation without requiring any action from the PS. We investigate the power allocation in the SS when OIC is applied over multiple channels. We show that the optimal power allocation can be achieved with intercepted water-filling instead of the conventional water-filling. The results show a significant gain for the rate achieved by OIC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221530.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"475","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Interference Cancellation in Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Cognitive radio","Decoding","Chromium","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Base stations","Technological innovation","Laboratories","Hydrogen"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decoding","interference suppression","multi-access systems","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","cognitive radio receiver","spectrally efficient operation","multiple access channel","primary transmitter","signal decoding","rate adaptation","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Interference Cancellation in Cognitive Radio Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869731","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Interference Cancellation in Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07106S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221532,"authors":[{"name":"Dinesh Datla","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Datla","id":"37294213600"},{"name":"Rakesh Rajbanshi","affiliation":["Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Rajbanshi","id":"37297144100"},{"name":"Alexander M.

It is envisioned that DSA can substantially increase the capacity of wireless networks by broadening the utilization of radio resources. Given the ubiquitous use of Internet's Transport Control Protocol (TCP), it can be expected that TCP will be used in DSA networks in the future. Whether TCP can efficiently provide stable end-to-end transmissions over DSA links, given their dynamic and unpredictable nature, remained unclear. Therefore, we have studied by simulation the ability of various TCP flavors to efficiently utilize DSA links. We have performed simulations using the TCP stack from the Linux operating system. Our simulations show that modern TCPs can efficiently make use of the dynamic capacity of DSA links for bulk data transmission, under a wide range of conditions, but only if certain requirements are met. We also analytically determine the effect of Primary User (PU) detection errors on TCP performance and conclude that the dominating component responsible for TCP throughput reduction in a DSA environment is the observation time, not, as one might expect, PU detection errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9869734","htmlLink":"/document/4221533/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Transport Control Protocol Over Dynamic Spectrum Access Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Transport Control Protocol Over Dynamic Spectrum Access Links","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077278S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4221534,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Perich","affiliation":["Shared Spectrum Company, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Perich","id":"37268967000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221534","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":26,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Access control","Interference","Prototypes","Radio spectrum management","Security","Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis","Kernel","Software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","radio spectrum management","signal detection","software radio","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["policy-based network management","spectrum security access control","DARPA next generation communications program","signal-detection-based interference-avoidance algorithms","software-defined radios"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design and implementation of a policy-based spectrum access control framework as part of the DARPA next generation communications program. The main emphasis of the framework is to overcome two types of concerns: harmful interference caused by a malfunctioning device and harmful interference caused by a malicious user. In tandem with signal-detection-based interference-avoidance algorithms employed by software-defined radios, we design a set of policy- based components, tightly integrated with the accredited kernel on the radio, for avoiding potentially harmful interference caused by a malfunctioning device. The policy conformance and enforcement components ensure that a radio does not violate policies, which define regulatory and other stakeholders' goals and requirements, and which are encoded in an abstract, declarative language. We further secure the policy management and distribution mechanisms in order to prevent malicious users from altering loaded policies as well as from inserting additional policies and thus causing a harmful interference. Additionally, we report on a prototype implementation and demonstration of our framework, which qualitatively illustrates the capability offered to radio for enforcing policies and the capability for managing radios and securing access control to interfaces changing the radio's configuration.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.72","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.72","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","startPage":"496","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Policy-Based Network Management for NeXt Generation Spectrum Access Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Policy-Based Network Management for NeXt Generation Spectrum Access Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221534/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221534/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869735","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Policy-Based Network Management for NeXt Generation Spectrum Access Control","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047108S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221535,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Beibei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292889800"},{"name":"Zhu Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Ji","id":"37278629100"},{"name":"K.

The spectrum access can be designed in an opportunistic way to efficiently and fairly share the spectrum resources among multiple unlicensed users, while not disturbing primary users' spectrum usage. In this paper, we propose a primary-prioritized Markov approach for dynamic spectrum access through modeling the interactions between the primary users and the unlicensed users as continuous- time Markov chains (CTMC). By designing appropriate access probabilities for the unlicensed users, the spectrum dynamics can be captured using CTMC models to optimally coordinate the spectrum access of the unlicensed users so that a good tradeoff can be achieved between the spectrum efficiency and fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed primary-prioritized dynamic spectrum access approach under proportional fairness criterion not only provides fair spectrum sharing among unlicensed users with only small performance degradation compared to the approach maximizing the overall average throughput, but also achieves much higher throughput than CSMA-based random access approaches and the approach achieving max-min fairness.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.73","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221535.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.73","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","startPage":"507","endPage":"515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary-Prioritized Markov Approach for Dynamic Spectrum Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Primary-Prioritized Markov Approach for Dynamic Spectrum Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221535/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221535/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869736","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary-Prioritized Markov Approach for Dynamic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069582S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":4221536,"authors":[{"name":"Koji Maeda","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Maeda","id":"37700028000"},{"name":"Anass Benjebbour","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Anass","lastName":"Benjebbour","id":"37294604500"},{"name":"Takahiro Asai","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Asai","id":"37272096100"},{"name":"Tatsuo Furuno","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Furuno","id":"37346789600"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Ohya","affiliation":["Research Laboratories, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Ohya","id":"37391823100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221536","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Autocorrelation","Signal generators","Laboratories","Signal detection","Computer vision","Access control","Blind equalizers","Transmitters","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","correlation methods","OFDM modulation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationarity-inducing transmission technique","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","air interface","cyclic autocorrelation function","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","signal recognition","cognitive radio","signal classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents cyclostationarity-inducing transmission techniques that enable the receiver to distinguish among different systems employing OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) as a common air interface. Several systems using different air interfaces may have different properties of cyclostationarity that can be utilized to distinguish among them. However, this is usually not possible when the same air interface is used. To address this problem for systems using OFDM as an air interface, we consider methods that induce different properties of cyclostationarity in the transmitter of different systems. Specifically, we configure the OFDM signal before transmission such that its cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) has peaks at certain pre-chosen cycle frequencies. The difference in the cycle frequencies, at which the CAF peaks occur for the configured OFDM signals, is utilized to distinguish among several systems even when OFDM is used as a common air interface. Two configuration methods for the OFDM signal are proposed. The first proposed method inserts a specific preamble at the head of each OFDM frame. Each preamble is configured such that only a selected subset of subcarriers is used for transmission. A different subset of subcarriers results in the occurrence of CAF peaks at different cycle frequencies for the OFDM signal. The second proposed method is based on dedicating a few subcarriers in an OFDM frame to the transmission of specific signals so that the whole frame exhibits cyclostationarity at pre-chosen cycle frequencies. For this method, we introduce a method for generating signals on the dedicated subcarriers and describe their relation to the cycle frequencies of the configured OFDM frame. Both proposed methods are evaluated by computer simulation in a multipath Rayleigh fading environment. Simulation results show that system recognition based on the proposed methods exhibits excellent detection probability.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.74","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221536.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition Among OFDM-Based Systems Utilizing Cyclostationarity-Inducing Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221536/","displayDocTitle":"Recognition Among OFDM-Based Systems Utilizing Cyclostationarity-Inducing Transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869737","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221536/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition Among OFDM-Based Systems Utilizing Cyclostationarity-Inducing Transmission","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064342S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4221537,"authors":[{"name":"Serena Chan","affiliation":["Institute for Defense AnaIyses, Alexandria, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Serena","lastName":"Chan","id":"37600909700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221537","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Availability","Government","Radio spectrum management","Weapons","Electromagnetic spectrum","Legislation","Electromagnetic propagation","Current measurement","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military communication","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared spectrum access environments","US DoD","Department of Defense","military communication","spectrum management"]}],"abstract":"The United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) must anticipate and balance military, civil, and commercial interests in spectrum. Increasing demands are being placed on spectrum access, both domestic and abroad, as a result of current demands for global mobility, electromagnetic spectrum requirements of both outdated and future defense systems, and loss of military access to certain frequency bands due to spectrum legislation. Based on these conditions, the DoD should identify shared spectrum access opportunities and explore dynamic spectrum access technologies to help meet the growing spectrum needs of the military.

We consider a primary license holder who aims to lease its spectrum within a certain geographic subregion of its own network. Such a transaction has two contrasting economic implications for the seller: On the one hand the seller obtains a revenue due to the exercised price, or rent, of the region. On the other hand, the seller incurs a cost due to (i) reduced spatial coverage of its network and (ii) possible interference from the leased region into the retained portion of its network. We formulate an optimization problem with the objective of profit maximization, and characterize its solutions based on a reduced load approximation that can be shown to be asymptotically exact. The form of optimal prices suggests charging the buyer per admitted call, in proportion with the interference it generates. The charged amount balances the corresponding loss of revenue incurred by the seller due to the influence of an admitted call. We numerically argue that this pricing approach yields better profit compared to some other simplistic techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary Pricing of Spectrum in Cellular CDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.76","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221538.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Secondary Pricing of Spectrum in Cellular CDMA Networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221538/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869739","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary Pricing of Spectrum in Cellular CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064175S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4221539,"authors":[{"name":"Rocco Di Taranto","affiliation":["Center for TeleInFrastructure (CTIF), University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Di Taranto","id":"37688790500"},{"name":"Kentaro Nishimori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Nishimori","id":"37264894100"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Center for TeleInFrastructure (CTIF), University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Yomo","affiliation":["Center for TeleInFrastructure (CTIF), University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Yomo","id":"37296388400"},{"name":"Yasushi Takatori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Takatori","id":"37265912800"},{"name":"Ramjee Prasad","affiliation":["Center for TeleInFrastructure (CTIF), University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ramjee","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37275200300"},{"name":"Shuji Kubota","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuji","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37266418200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221539","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Interference","Spread spectrum communication","Cognitive radio","Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Gratings","Directive antennas","Degradation","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna pattern switching","interference-induced multi-hop transmissions","cognitive radio networks","adaptive array antenna"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a simple antenna switching and a relay technique for cognitive radios using adaptive array antenna to effectively reduce the interference from the primary system. While the adaptive array antenna can create null towards the direction of primary system, the created antenna pattern can result in non- optimized pattern between cognitive nodes.

With this technique, each cognitive radio node is equipped with three antennas and each node tries to select the antenna configuration resulting in the best antenna pattern for each link. Furthermore, we propose a combination between the above simple antenna switching and the interference-induced multi-hop transmission where the multi-hop transmission is utilized when a link in the network suffers from the low transmission quality due to the created antenna pattern.

The measurements investigate the time-variation of powers in 2G bands (900 MHz and 1800 MHz), a spectrum bandwidth including 3G bands and an ISM band (2000- 2600 MHz), and a global band (400-2600 MHz), on the day prior to a match, the day of the match, and during the match. The first intention is to study changes in power levels and subsequently relate this to specific events, such as (i) the start of the match, (ii) half-time, and (Hi) the end of the match. A next intention is to investigate the autocorrelation structure of changes in power levels, and relate this to the ease with which dynamic spectrum allocation might be performed. The results that ensue are used to inspire a discussion as to how dynamic spectrum allocation and short-range localized solutions such as IEEE 802.11 basestations might be leveraged to bolster capacity at large-scale events.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221543.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Power Measurements in 2G and 3G Cellular Phone Bands During the 2006 Football World Cup in Germany","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power measurement","Cellular phones","Performance evaluation","Time measurement","Downlink","GSM","Distributed control","Sensor systems","Telecommunications","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","frequency allocation","sport"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum power measurement","2G-3G cellular phone band","Germany football world cup","spectrum bandwidth","dynamic spectrum allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Power Measurements in 2G and 3G Cellular Phone Bands During the 2006 Football World Cup in Germany","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221543/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869744","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Power Measurements in 2G and 3G Cellular Phone Bands During the 2006 Football World Cup in Germany","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050165S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4221546,"authors":[{"name":"Dale N.

A recent precedent centers on efforts in the U.S. to allow Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure devices to operate in the 5.25- 5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands without causing interference to existing radio frequency operations (government radars) through the use of dynamic frequency selection (\"DFS\") and Transmit Power Control (\"TPC\"). Another, slightly older precedent is the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's policies and rules that permit the utilization of \"decentralized trunking\" in the VHF and UHF private land mobile radio (\"PLMR\") service bands. Under these rules, adequate \"monitoring\" (a.k.a., \"listen-before-talk\" or \"LBT\") is required in order to share spectrum under a decentralized trunking approach. This paper analyzes the potential value of this older precedent in advocating for broader regulatory acquiescence and near-term deployment of DSA technology. Arguably, in the U.S., a DSA radio system using technology to achieve decentralized trunking capabilities could be introduced onto shared channels in the PLMR bands without any major changes in the Commission's existing rules or policies. Using LBT functionality with advanced sensing algorithms, together with DFS and TPC capabilities, could promote shared access via decentralized trunking in the VHF PLMR band, where licensees often employ non-standard channel pairs or un-paired (simplex) channels, and the UHF PLMR band, which is often characterized as overcrowded but underutilized. However, some economic and regulatory barriers to the development of robust secondary market access to these spectrum bands may hinder the full potential of DSA technologies in these bands.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.84","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221546.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.84","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","startPage":"597","endPage":"605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Potential Value of Decentralized Trunking as Regulatory Precedent for the Introduction of Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Potential Value of Decentralized Trunking as Regulatory Precedent for the Introduction of Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221546/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221546/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869747","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Potential Value of Decentralized Trunking as Regulatory Precedent for the Introduction of Dynamic Spectrum Access Technology","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041665S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221547,"authors":[{"name":"John M.

Leases are widely used in computer and network design. They are useful whenever it is difficult to revoke rights explicitly, such as in cases where the rights holders cannot be cost-efficiently located or contacted. This paper analyzes ways to use the lease concept to facilitate innovation in radio devices and wireless communication. In our vision, manufacturers include in their devices a simple, secure subsystem that contains a clock and controls critical features such as transmitter power and frequency settings. The subsystem has enough computing power to validate cryptographically-signed lease extension messages. It disables specified radio features if no extension message has been received by the end of the lease period. These requirements are not onerous for the types of radios where leases would be used. When devices provide this support, regulators may use certification leases rather than permanent grants to accelerate deployment of innovative radios. Spectrum rights holders may use leases to reduce risk in secondary spectrum market transactions. Firms collaborating in innovative wireless service business models can better retain control of their respective rights. We investigate leases from both technical and policy perspectives and conclude that they can provide significant benefits for the commercialization and deployment of innovative radios.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.85","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221547.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.85","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","startPage":"606","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Limited Leases for Innovative Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Time-Limited Leases for Innovative Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221547/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869748","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Limited Leases for Innovative Radios","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066615S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221550,"authors":[{"name":"Milind M.

Terms such as reconfigurable networks, Software Defined Radios (SDRs), Cognitive Radios and Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have gained common use. Radio spectrum is a multidimensional entity; space, time, polarization, frequency, power of signal transmission and interference are some of the key dimensions. The static, command- and-control management of spectrum has led to barriers to accessing the spectrum in various dimensions. The notion of dynamic spectrum access can break these barriers in one or more of the dimensions. A review of published research in the technology, policy and legal facets of this broad area indicates that the community is addressing this problem from multitude of angles. In fact, we believe the situation is analogous to story of seven blind men attempting to describe an elephant based on what they perceive when they touch various parts of the elephant. As such, we contend that unless a clear taxonomy of various ways of dynamic access is developed, significant confusion can prevail within the community dealing with these new ways. This paper tries to rectify this situation. It aims to develop a clear taxonomy of various forms of DSA networks, describe in detail various models and identify required technology capabilities, architectural innovations and policy changes.","doi":"10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.88","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221461/4221462/04221550.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Dynamic Spectrum Access: Models,Taxonomy and Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221550/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Dynamic Spectrum Access: Models,Taxonomy and Challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9869751","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221550/","conferenceDate":"17-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Dynamic Spectrum Access: Models,Taxonomy and Challenges","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097239S","chronDate":"17-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221461","isNumber":"4221462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221461","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4221462","articleId":"4221550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221552,"authors":[{"name":"Mark McHenry","affiliation":["Shared Spectrum Company, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"McHenry","id":"37392101800"},{"name":"Eugene Livsics","affiliation":["Shared Spectrum Company, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Livsics","id":"37688786300"},{"name":"Thao Nguyen","affiliation":["Shared Spectrum Company, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Thao","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37696760900"},{"name":"Nivedita Majumdar","affiliation":["Shared Spectrum Company, Vienna, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Nivedita","lastName":"Majumdar","id":"38179924900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0663-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4221552","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","System testing","Interference","WiMAX","RF signals","Bandwidth","Radio network","Cognitive radio","Government","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XG Radio system","dynamic spectrum sharing","field test","Virginia","radio channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the results of field testing of the XG Radio system.

We demonstrate that variance reduction has an additional benefit of 10% to the overall coverage of the test method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Circuit testing","Manufacturing","Semiconductor device testing","Current measurement","Counting circuits","Pulse width modulation","Technological innovation","Robustness","Integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variance reduction","supply ramp test method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETS.2007.44","publicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221553/4221554/04221574.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2007.44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variance Reduction for Supply Ramp Based Cheap RF Test Alternatives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variance Reduction for Supply Ramp Based Cheap RF Test Alternatives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221574/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221574/","accessionNumber":"10300643","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variance Reduction for Supply Ramp Based Cheap RF Test Alternatives","confLoc":"Freiburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"28270055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074016S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221553","isNumber":"4221554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221553","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4221554","articleId":"4221574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221575,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37411446600"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2827-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1877"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1780"}],"articleNumber":"4221575","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":42,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Fault diagnosis","Microfluidics","Biochemical analysis","Electrodes","Food manufacturing","Chemical technology","Proteins","Monitoring","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","fluidic devices","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel scan-like testing","fault diagnosis","digital microfluidic biochips","complexity analysis","droplet-based biochip"]}],"abstract":"Dependability is an important attribute for microfluidic biochips that are used for safety-critical applications such as point-of-care health assessment, air-quality monitoring, and food-safety testing. Therefore, these devices must be adequately tested after manufacture and during bioassay operations. Moreover, since disposable biochips are being targeted for a highly competitive and low-cost market segment, test and diagnosis methods should be inexpensive, quick, and effective. We propose a cost-effective testing methodology referred to as \"parallel scan-like test\", and a rapid diagnosis method based on test outcomes, for droplet-based microfluidic devices. The proposed method allows testing using parallel droplet pathways in both on-line and off-line scenarios. The diagnosis outcome can be used to reconfigure a droplet-based biochip such that faults can be easily avoided, thereby enhancing chip yield and defect tolerance. We evaluate the proposed test and diagnosis methods using complexity analysis as well as experiments using a fabricated biochip.","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2007.32","publicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221553/4221554/04221575.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2007.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Scan-Like Testing and Fault Diagnosis Techniques for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221575/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Scan-Like Testing and Fault Diagnosis Techniques for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10286664","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221575/","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Scan-Like Testing and Fault Diagnosis Techniques for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"Freiburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"28270063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061839S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221553","isNumber":"4221554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221553","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4221554","articleId":"4221575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4221577,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Therefore embedded memories are commonly equipped with spare rows and columns (2D redundancy). To avoid the storage of large failure bitmaps needed by classical algorithms for offline repair analysis, existing heuristics for built-in repair analysis (BIRA) either follow very simple search strategies or restrict the search to smaller local bitmaps. Exact BIRA algorithms work with sub analyzers for each possible repair combination. While a parallel implementation suffers from a high hardware overhead, a serial implementation leads to high test times. The integrated built-in test and repair approach proposed in this paper interleaves test and repair analysis and supports an exact solution without failure bitmap. The basic search procedure is combined with an efficient technique to continuously reduce the problem complexity and keep the test and analysis time low.","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221553/4221554/04221579.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2007.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2007.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Built-In Test and Repair Approach for Memories with 2D Redundancy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Testing","Redundancy","Failure analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Costs","System-on-a-chip","Binary search trees","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","logic testing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated built-in test","2D redundancy","on-chip infrastructure","memory test","SoC","offline repair analysis","built-in repair analysis","systems-on-a-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Built-In Test and Repair Approach for Memories with 2D Redundancy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10300647","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Built-In Test and Repair Approach for Memories with 2D Redundancy","confLoc":"Freiburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"28270091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101001S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221553","isNumber":"4221554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221553","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4221554","articleId":"4221579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221580,"authors":[{"name":"A.

From manufacturing data, we show that in some cases, a resistive-open defect may lead to a new type of dynamic behavior which has never been published in the past. This faulty behavior can be modeled as a dynamic two-cell Incorrect Read Fault (d2cIRF). Such d2cIRF is the consequence of a failure in the sense amplifier which prevents it to perform any read operations. We show that it requires a specific sequence of read operations to be detected. Results of electrical simulations are presented to give a complete understanding of such a faulty behavior. Finally, a possible March test solution is presented to allow the detection of d2cIRFs in all sense amplifiers of an SRAM.","doi":"10.1109/ETS.2007.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETS.2007.19","publicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"12th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221553/4221554/04221580.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Two-Cell Incorrect Read Fault Due to Resistive-Open Defects in the Sense Amplifiers of SRAMs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2007","accessionNumber":"10300648","htmlLink":"/document/4221580/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Two-Cell Incorrect Read Fault Due to Resistive-Open Defects in the Sense Amplifiers of SRAMs","confLoc":"Freiburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"28270097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076207S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221553","isNumber":"4221554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221553","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4221554","articleId":"4221580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4221589,"authors":[{"name":"L.

On the other hand, attempting to realize the vision will provide insights that can be used to significantly reduce the gap between evolving software complexity and the technologies used to manage complexity.","doi":"10.1109/FOSE.2007.14","publicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221600/4221601/04221611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221601","startPage":"37","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven Development of Complex Software: A Research Roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven Development of Complex Software: A Research Roadmap","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221611/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10290913","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221611/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven Development of Complex Software: A Research Roadmap","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28290037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096716S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221600","isNumber":"4221601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221600","citationCount":"454","xplore-issue":"4221601","articleId":"4221611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221612,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Pretschner","affiliation":["Information Security, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4221600/4221601/4221612/4221612-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexander Pretschner is a senior researcher at ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, currently concentrating on model-based testing and distributed usage control.

Testing, the subject of this paper, is a widespread validation approach in industry, but it is still largely ad hoc, expensive, and unpredictably effective. Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams. The routes from the achievements to the dreams are paved by the outstanding research challenges, which are discussed in the paper along with interesting ongoing work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221614/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10300504","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221614/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Software Testing Research: Achievements, Challenges, Dreams","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Testing Research: Achievements, Challenges, Dreams","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28290085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114301S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221600","isNumber":"4221601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221600","citationCount":"306","xplore-issue":"4221601","articleId":"4221614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4221618,"authors":[{"name":"Michael R.

In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration.

Integral to this effort is developing shared understanding surrounding multiple artifacts, each artifact embodying its own model, over the entire development process. This focus on model- oriented collaboration embedded within a larger process is what distinguishes collaboration research in software engineering from broader collaboration research, which tends to address artifact-neutral coordination technologies and toolkits. This article first presents a list of goals for software engineering collaboration, then surveys existing collaboration support tools in software engineering. The survey covers both tools that focus on a single artifact or stage in the development process (requirements support tools, UML collaboration tools), and tools that support the representation and execution of an entire software process. Important collaboration standards are also described. Several possible future directions for collaboration in software engineering are presented, including tight integration between web and desktop development environments, broader participation by customers and end users in the entire development process, capturing argumentation surrounding design rationale, and use of massively multiplayer online (MMO) game technology as a collaboration medium. The article concludes by noting a problem in performing research on collaborative systems, that of assessing how well certain artifacts, models, and embedded processes work, and whether they are better than other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/FOSE.2007.4","publicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221600/4221601/04221622.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaboration in Software Engineering: A Roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221622/","displayDocTitle":"Collaboration in Software Engineering: A Roadmap","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10290915","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221622/","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaboration in Software Engineering: A Roadmap","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28290214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069754S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221600","isNumber":"4221601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221600","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"4221601","articleId":"4221622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4221626,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Dearle","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4221600/4221601/4221626/4221626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alan Dearle is a Professor of Computer Science at St Andrews, Scotland's first University.

Software deployment is a post- production activity that is performed for or by the customer of a piece of software. Today's software often consists of a large number of components each offering and requiring services of other components. Such components are often deployed into distributed, heterogeneous environments adding to the complexity of software deployment. This paper sets out a standard terminology for the various deployment activities and the entities over which they operate. Six case studies of current deployment technologies are made to illustrate various approaches to the deployment problems. The paper then examines specific deployment issues in more detail before examining some of the future directions in which the field of deployment might take.","doi":"10.1109/FOSE.2007.20","startPage":"269","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221601","displayPublicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221600/4221601/04221626.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Deployment, Past, Present and Future","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221626/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Software Deployment, Past, Present and Future","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221626/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10290918","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Deployment, Past, Present and Future","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28290269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070362S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221600","isNumber":"4221601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221600","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4221601","articleId":"4221626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4221628,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Shepperd","affiliation":["School of Information Systems, Computing & Maths, Brunei University, West London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4221600/4221601/4221628/4221628-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Shepperd received a PhD in computer science from the Open University, UK in 1991 for his work in measurement theory and its application to software engineering.

I argue that this is an important sub-discipline since this will underpin any cost-benefit analysis used to justify the resourcing, or otherwise, of a software project. To accomplish this I conducted a bibliometric analysis of peer reviewed research articles to identify major areas of activity. My results indicate that the primary goal of more accurate cost prediction systems remains largely unachieved. However, there are a number of new and promising avenues of research including: how we can combine results from primary studies, integration of multiple predictions and applying greater emphasis upon the human aspects of prediction tasks. I conclude that the field is likely to remain very challenging due to the people-centric nature of software engineering, since it is in essence a design task. Nevertheless the need for good economic models will grow rather than diminish as software becomes increasingly ubiquitous.","doi":"10.1109/FOSE.2007.23","publicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Future of Software Engineering (FOSE '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221600/4221601/04221628.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software project economics: a roadmap","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221628/","displayDocTitle":"Software project economics: a roadmap","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10290919","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221628/","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software project economics: a roadmap","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28290304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10883S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221600","isNumber":"4221601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221600","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4221601","articleId":"4221628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4221631,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Harman","affiliation":["King''s College, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4221600/4221601/4221631/4221631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark Harman is Professor of Software Engineering and head of the Software Engineering Group at the Department of Computer Science, King's College, London, where he also directs the work of the Centre for Research on Evolution, Search and Technology (CREST).

Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.367856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.367856","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221659.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221659/","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9551415","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065974S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"1292","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4221660,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhang","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37289944300"},{"name":"Nick Koudas","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Koudas","id":"37283179500"},{"name":"Divesh Srivastava","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Divesh","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37283180800"},{"name":"Ting Yu","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Yu","id":"37276542900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0802-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0803-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4221660","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":129,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":579},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aggregates","Privacy","Protection","Remuneration","Databases","Availability","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Public healthcare","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aggregate query answering","anonymized table","microdata privacy protection","k-anonymity","l-diversity","categorical sensitive attribute","numerical sensitive attribute","undesirable information leakage","ad hoc aggregate analysis","permutation-based anonymization"]}],"abstract":"Privacy is a serious concern when microdata need to be released for ad hoc analyses. The privacy goals of existing privacy protection approaches (e.g., k-anonymity and l-diversity) are suitable only for categorical sensitive attributes. Since applying them directly to numerical sensitive attributes (e.g., salary) may result in undesirable information leakage, we propose privacy goals to better capture the need of privacy protection for numerical sensitive attributes. Complementing the desire for privacy is the need to support ad hoc aggregate analyses over microdata. Existing generalization-based anonymization approaches cannot answer aggregate queries with reasonable accuracy. We present a general framework of permutation-based anonymization to support accurate answering of aggregate queries and show that, for the same grouping, permutation-based techniques can always answer aggregate queries more accurately than generalization-based approaches. We further propose several criteria to optimize permutations for accurate answering of aggregate queries, and develop efficient algorithms for each criterion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregate Query Answering on Anonymized Tables","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.367857","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221660.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.367857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Aggregate Query Answering on Anonymized Tables","conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221660/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9551416","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregate Query Answering on Anonymized Tables","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071373S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221684,"authors":[{"name":"Huiming Qu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Huiming","lastName":"Qu","id":"37553440600"},{"name":"Alexandros Labrinidis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Labrinidis","id":"37267169000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0802-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0803-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4221684","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221684","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Dynamic scheduling","Measurement","Quality of service","Databases","Weather forecasting","Processor scheduling","Technology management","Laboratories","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","Internet","quality of service","query processing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preference-aware query","update scheduling","Web database systems","read-only queries","dynamic Web pages","quality contracts","quality of service","quality of data","adaptive algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.367881","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221684.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.367881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preference-Aware Query and Update Scheduling in Web-databases","abstract":"Typical Web-database systems receive read-only queries, that generate dynamic Web pages as a response, and write-only updates, that keep information up-to-date. Users expect short response times and low staleness. However, it may be extremely hard to apply all updates on time, i.e., keep zero staleness, and also get fast response times, especially in periods of bursty traffic. In this paper, we present the concept of quality contracts (QCs) which combines the two incomparable performance metrics: response time or quality of service (QoS), and staleness or quality of data (QoD). QCs allows individual users to express their preferences for the expected QoS and QoD of their queries by assigning \"profit\" values. To maximize the total profit from submitted QCs, we propose an adaptive algorithm, called QUTS. QUTS addresses the problem of prioritizing the scheduling of updates over queries using a two-level scheduling scheme that dynamically allocates CPU resources to updates and queries according to user preferences. We present the results of an extensive experimental study using real data (taken from a stock information Web site), where we show that QUTS performs better than baseline algorithms under the entire spectrum of QCs; QUTS also adapts fast to changing workloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4221684/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9551986","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Preference-Aware Query and Update Scheduling in Web-databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preference-Aware Query and Update Scheduling in Web-databases","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064742S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221710,"authors":[{"name":"Sarvjeet Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Sarvjeet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37697493700"},{"name":"Chris Mayfield","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Mayfield","id":"37688596500"},{"name":"Sunil Prabhakar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Prabhakar","id":"37279218800"},{"name":"Rahul Shah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Shah","id":"37279452900"},{"name":"Susanne Hambrusch","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Hambrusch","id":"37276647300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0802-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0803-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4221710","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Uncertainty","Cleaning","Database systems","Relational databases","Web pages","Computer science","Application software","Biology","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database indexing","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain categorical data indexing","database management systems","uncertainty handling","R-tree","inverted index structure"]}],"abstract":"Uncertainty in categorical data is commonplace in many applications, including data cleaning, database integration, and biological annotation. In such domains, the correct value of an attribute is often unknown, but may be selected from a reasonable number of alternatives. Current database management systems do not provide a convenient means for representing or manipulating this type of uncertainty. In this paper we extend traditional systems to explicitly handle uncertainty in data values. We propose two index structures for efficiently searching uncertain categorical data, one based on the R-tree and another based on an inverted index structure. Using these structures, we provide a detailed description of the probabilistic equality queries they support. Experimental results using real and synthetic datasets demonstrate how these index structures can effectively improve the performance of queries through the use of internal probabilistic information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indexing Uncertain Categorical Data","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.367907","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221710.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.367907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Indexing Uncertain Categorical Data","conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221710/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9551862","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indexing Uncertain Categorical Data","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083456S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221716,"authors":[{"name":"Tingjian Ge","affiliation":["Brown University, USA"],"firstName":"Tingjian","lastName":"Ge","id":"37070384400"},{"name":"Stan Zdonik","affiliation":["Brown University, USA"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Zdonik","id":"37346957100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0802-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0803-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4221716","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":655},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Indexing","Information security","Data security","Access control","Database systems","Proposals","Information systems","Data warehouses","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data warehouses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast secure encryption","column-oriented DBMS indexing","networked information systems","database system","database encryption scheme","column stores","data warehouses","trusted server","cryptography","INFO-CPA-DB"]}],"abstract":"Networked information systems require strong security guarantees because of the new threats that they face. Various forms of encryption have been proposed to deal with this problem. In a database system, there are often two contradictory goals: security of the encryption and fast performance of queries. There have been a number of proposals of database encryption schemes to facilitate queries on encrypted columns. Order-preserving encryption techniques are well-suited for databases since they support a simple, and efficient way to build indices. However, as we will show, they are insecure under straightforward attack scenarios. We propose a new light-weight database encryption scheme (called FCE) for column stores in data warehouses with trusted servers. The low decryption overhead of FCE makes comparisons of ciphertexts and hence indexing operations very fast. Since it is hard to use classical security definitions in cryptography to prove the security of any existing symmetric encryption scheme, we propose a relaxed measure of security, called INFO-CPA-DB. INFO-CPA-DB is based on a well-established security definition in cryptography and relaxes it using information theoretic concepts. Using INFO-CPA-DB, we give strong evidence that FCE is as secure as any underlying block cipher (yet more efficient than using the block cipher itself). Using the same security measure we also show the inherent insecurity of any order preserving encryption scheme under straightforward attack scenarios. We discuss indexing techniques based on FCE as well.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.367913","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221716.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.367913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast, Secure Encryption for Indexing in a Column-Oriented DBMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221716/","displayDocTitle":"Fast, Secure Encryption for Indexing in a Column-Oriented DBMS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9551853","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221716/","conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast, Secure Encryption for Indexing in a Column-Oriented DBMS","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085302S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221738,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A.

Applications include word spotting, sensor pattern matching, and monitoring of bio-medical signals (e.g., EKG, ECG), and monitoring of environmental (seismic and volcanic) signals. DTW is a very popular distance measure, permitting accelerations and decelerations, and it has been studied for finite, stored sequence sets. However, in many applications such as network analysis and sensor monitoring, massive amounts of data arrive continuously and it is infeasible to save all the historical data. We propose SPRING, a novel algorithm that can solve the problem. We provide a theoretical analysis and prove that SPRING does not sacrifice accuracy, while it requires constant space and time per time-tick. These are dramatic improvements over the naive method. Our experiments on real and realistic data illustrate that SPRING does indeed detect the qualifying subsequences correctly and that it can offer dramatic improvements in speed over the naive implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2007.368963","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221634/4221635/04221753.pdf","startPage":"1046","endPage":"1055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2007.368963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4221753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stream Monitoring under the Time Warping Distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221753/","displayDocTitle":"Stream Monitoring under the Time Warping Distance","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221753/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-20 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9551827","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stream Monitoring under the Time Warping Distance","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"ICDE-00-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097591S","chronDate":"15-20 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4221634","isNumber":"4221635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221634","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4221635","articleId":"4221753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4221900,"authors":[{"name":"Mary George","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kerala, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"George","id":"37693437200"},{"name":"M.R.

The ontology is partitioned and each node learns a dimension of the user's interest using one partition, all partitions together form the user's profile. The system adapts itself to the changing interests of the user by means of aging. We use hierarchical neural networks to classify the documents into concepts in reference ontology. To overcome the problem of training in cases where insufficient documents are available for a particular concept and to increase the scalability we propose to use two different hierarchical neural network classifiers, each using a different learning function.

These binary data are distorted while reading out of the recording medium or arriving at the receiver end due to inter symbol interference in the channel. The adaptive channel equalizer alleviates this distortion and reconstructs the transmitted data faithfully. The bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) is a recently developed efficient and derivative free evolutionary computing tool used for optimization purpose. In the present paper we propose a novel nonlinear channel equalizer using BFO algorithm. The recovery performance of the new equalizer is obtained through computer simulation study using nonlinear channels. It is shown that the proposed equalizer offers superior performance both in terms of bit-error-rate and convergence speed compared to the GA based equalizers. In addition it requires substantially less computation during training.","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2007.369224","publicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Digital Information Management","startPage":"367","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2007.369224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4221857","pdfPath":"/iel5/4221856/4221857/04221916.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st International Conference on Digital Information Management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microorganisms","Nonlinear distortion","Artificial neural networks","Communication channels","Dispersion","Adaptive equalizers","Information technology","Magnetic noise","Intersymbol interference","Low pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","evolutionary computation","intersymbol interference","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital information recovery","bacterial foraging optimization","nonlinear channel equalizers","intersymbol interference","adaptive channel equalizer","evolutionary computing tool","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of Digital Information Using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Based Nonlinear Channel Equalizers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4221916/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4221916/","accessionNumber":"10300553","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","conferenceDate":"6-6 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of Digital Information Using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Based Nonlinear Channel Equalizers","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ICDIM-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066764S","chronDate":"6-6 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4221856","isNumber":"4221857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221856","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4221857","articleId":"4221916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4222038,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The lack of unoccupied bandwidth and the potential to modulate increased carrier frequencies with multi-gigabit data rates will push their operation frequencies above 100 GHz. Based on measurements and ray-tracing simulations we discuss technology and propagation constraints of such systems that will have to rely on directed transmission. We show that dielectric mirrors covering parts of the walls will enhance the signal coverage in a typical indoor scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4222038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9693772","htmlLink":"/document/4222038/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Concept and Perspectives of Future Ultra Broadband THz Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept and Perspectives of Future Ultra Broadband THz Communication Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"ICIMW-00-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049695S","chronDate":"18-22 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4221943","isNumber":"4221944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4221943","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4221944","articleId":"4222038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4222161,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hong","id":"38667477800"},{"name":"Bing Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37291893300"},{"name":"Yuanqing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293665000"},{"name":"Qinghua Lai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Lai","id":"37407813700"},{"name":"Hongjun Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289159900"},{"name":"Xiao Xin Yin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao Xin","lastName":"Yin","id":"37292611000"},{"name":"Yuan Dan Dong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan Dan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37291357600"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538295800"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0399-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0400-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2027"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"}],"articleNumber":"4222161","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":243,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave measurements","Millimeter wave propagation","Integrated circuit measurements","Millimeter wave integrated circuits","Microwave propagation","Attenuation measurement","Microwave measurements","Size measurement","Microstrip","Microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave integrated circuits","millimetre wave integrated circuits","waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half mode substrate integrated waveguide","microwave application","millimeter wave application","propagation characteristics","microwave integrated circuit","millimeter wave integrated circuit","guided wave structure"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new guided wave structure of half mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) for microwave and millimeter wave application is proposed for the first time.

Therefore, we cache locations that are likely to have faults: starting from the location of a known (fixed) fault, we cache the location itself, any locations changed together with the fault, recently added locations, and recently changed locations. By consulting the cache at the moment a fault is fixed, a developer can detect likely fault-prone locations. This is useful for prioritizing verification and validation resources on the most fault prone files or entities. In our evaluation of seven open source projects with more than 200,000 revisions, the cache selects 10% of the source code files; these files account for 73%-95% of faults - a significant advance beyond the state of the art.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2007.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4222554","startPage":"489","endPage":"498","displayPublicationTitle":"29th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4222553/4222554/04222610.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Faults from Cached History","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4222610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-26 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4222610/","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Faults from Cached History","conferenceDate":"20-26 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10355453","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Faults from Cached History","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28280489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100597S","chronDate":"20-26 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4222553","isNumber":"4222554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4222553","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4222554","articleId":"4222610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4222611,"authors":[{"name":"Per Runeson","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Runeson","id":"37272050100"},{"name":"Magnus Alexandersson","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Alexandersson","id":"37688471300"},{"name":"Oskar Nyholm","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oskar","lastName":"Nyholm","id":"37688470800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2828-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"4222611","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":254,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural language processing","Prototypes","Vocabulary","Software engineering","Software testing","Natural languages","Mobile communication","Failure analysis","Relays","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","program testing","software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duplicate defect report detection","natural language processing","software engineering","software testing","formal method","prototype tool","Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication","user testing"]}],"abstract":"Defect reports are generated from various testing and development activities in software engineering. Sometimes two reports are submitted that describe the same problem, leading to duplicate reports. These reports are mostly written in structured natural language, and as such, it is hard to compare two reports for similarity with formal methods. In order to identify duplicates, we investigate using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to support the identification. A prototype tool is developed and evaluated in a case study analyzing defect reports at Sony Ericsson mobile communications. The evaluation shows that about 2/3 of the duplicates can possibly be found using the NLP techniques. Different variants of the techniques provide only minor result differences, indicating a robust technology.

After a long editing session, a programmer will run regression tests to make sure she has not invalidated previously tested functionality. If a test fails unexpectedly, Crisp allows the programmer to select parts of the edit that affected the failing test and to add them to the original program, creating an intermediate version guaranteed to compile. Then the programmer can re-execute the test in order to locate the exact reasons for the failure by concentrating on those affecting changes that were applied. Using Crisp, a programmer can it- eratively select, apply, and undo individual (or sets of) affecting changes and, thus effectively find a small set of failure-inducing changes.

Ideally, the application architect could derive accurate performance predictions early in the project life-cycle, leveraging initial application design-level models and a description of the target software and hardware platforms. To this end, we have developed a capacity planning tool suite for component-based applications, called Revel8tor. The tool adheres to the model driven development paradigm and supports benchmarking and performance prediction for J2EE, .Net and Web services platforms. The suite is composed of three different tools: MDAPerf MDABench and DSLBench. MDAPerf allows annotation of design diagrams and derives performance analysis models. MDABench allows a customized benchmark application to be modeled in the UML 2.0 Testing Profile and automatically generates a deployable application, with measurement automatically conducted. DSLBench allows the same benchmark modeling and generation to be conducted using a simple performance engineering Domain Specific Language (DSL) in Microsoft Visual Studio. DSLBench integrates with Visual Studio and reuses its load testing infrastructure. Together, the tool suite can assist capacity planning across platforms in an automated fashion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4222650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-26 May 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-26 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4222650/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10355493","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Revel8or: Model Driven Capacity Planning Tool Suite","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revel8or: Model Driven Capacity Planning Tool Suite","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"28280797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045393S","chronDate":"20-26 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4222553","isNumber":"4222554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4222553","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4222554","articleId":"4222650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4222797,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As expected, Maximum Like-lihood (ML) detection was found to attain the best performance, although this was achieved at the cost of a high computational complexity. Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes such as Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation (TTCM) can be efficiently amalgamated with SDMA-OFDM systems for the sake of improving the achievable performance without bandwidth expansion. In this contribution, a MMSE-aided Iterative GA (IGA) MUD is proposed for employment in a TTCM-assisted SDMA-OFDM system, which is capable of achieving a similar performance to that attained by its optimum ML-aided counterpart at a significantly lower complexity, especially at high user loads. Moreover, when the proposed novel Biased Q-function Based Mutation (BQM) scheme is employed, the IGA-aided system's performance can be further improved by achieving an Eb/No gain of about 6dB in comparison to the TTCM-aided MMSE-SDMA-OFDM benchmarker system both in low-and high-throughput modem scenarios, respectively, while still maintaining a modest complexity.","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 6th IEE International Conference on 3G and Beyond","pdfPath":"/iel5/4222741/4222742/04222797.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 6th IEE International Conference on 3G and Beyond","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4222742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Multi-User Detection for OFDM Using Biased Mutation Assisted Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4222797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Multi-User Detection for OFDM Using Biased Mutation Assisted Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Multi-User Detection for OFDM Using Biased Mutation Assisted Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"IEECP-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021097S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2005","isNumber":"4222742","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4222741","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4222797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4222946,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lv","affiliation":["Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37288957600"},{"name":"Xing Li","affiliation":["China Education and Research Network, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862700"},{"name":"Tong Li","affiliation":["Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293056300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2844-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4222946","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Fault detection","Change detection algorithms","Testing","Wavelet transforms","Data engineering","Predictive models","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","error analysis","Internet","security of data","statistical analysis","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web-based application","traffic anomaly detection algorithm","network management","wavelet generalized likelihood ratio algorithm","error performance detection algorithm","error prediction","statistical variable","test window delay","fault detection"]}],"abstract":"Network traffic anomaly detection is a difficult problem in network management.

While tremendous research interests have been on score-level fusion, research work for decision-level fusion is sparse. This paper presents a particle swarm optimization based decision-level fusion scheme for optimizing classifier fusion performance. Multiple classifiers are fused at the decision level, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm finds optimal decision threshold for each classifier and the optimal fusion rule. Specifically, we present an optimal fusion strategy for fusing multiple classifiers to satisfy accuracy performance requirements, as applied to a real-world classification problem.

Multi-objective genetic algorithms have been very popular for handling trade-offs among various objectives. The concept of Pareto optimally has been introduced in works and multi-objective genetic algorithms have been developed for this purpose. What we have found is that every problem is unique and there is no black box approach to implement multi-objective genetic algorithms in all problems. We implement the Pareto-optimality concept to develop a multi-objective genetic algorithm for the 3D highway alignment optimization problem on which we have worked for the last 10 years. We apply the multi-objective optimization approach to an example problem on which we had previously worked.

This method is a break from traditional approach used by standard cross-over and mutation operators, which only explore the objective space through \"near-blind\" manipulation of solutions in the parameter space. Fundamentally, our proposed intelligent operators use learned models of the coupling between the objective space and the parameter space to generate successively better solutions by extrapolating (or interpolating) from known solutions directly in the objective space. We term our implementation of the developed techniques as the coupled approximators evolutionary algorithm (CAEA).

Therefore, over the past decade there has been great interest in techniques such as laser and flash lamp annealing (FLA). In addition, advanced ultra-fast annealing shows promise for technologies that are not directly related to Si device processing. The main reason for using FLA in alternative applications is the reduced thermal budget because of the short annealing time, which enables one to achieve high temperatures (> 500degC) in the near-surface region while keeping the substrate bulk relatively cold. This is of particularly high importance for the development of novel polymer-based electronics and flexible solar cell technologies, where the substrates cannot withstand temperatures in excess of 150degC. An overview of theoretical simulations and related results from FLA experiments for a variety of layered systems is given. The influence of the flash duration and intensity on the heat distribution and the resulting physical properties is considered. Design and performance issues of the FLA tools depending on the specific uses and technical requirements are addressed. Furthermore, topics covered include high-throughput applications e.g. for roll-to-roll production of polymer substrates. Results of a prototype tool for multi-flash processing up to a frequency of 1 Hz using a pulse duration of 1 ms are also discussed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lamps","Temperature","Substrates","Polymers","Photovoltaic cells","Rapid thermal annealing","Thermal conductivity","Ion beams","Physics","Optical materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incoherent light annealing","laser beam annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millisecond annealing","flashlamps","flash lamp annealing","reduced thermal budget","polymer-based electronics","flexible solar cell technologies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RTP.2006.367981","publicationTitle":"2006 14th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 14th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200427/4223089/04223108.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTP.2006.367981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millisecond Annealing with Flashlamps: Tool and Process Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millisecond Annealing with Flashlamps: Tool and Process Challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223108/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4223108/","accessionNumber":"9420230","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millisecond Annealing with Flashlamps: Tool and Process Challenges","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"RTP-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047421S","chronDate":"10-13 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4200427","isNumber":"4223089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4200427","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4223089","articleId":"4223108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4223148,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Geis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Geis","id":"37686139700"},{"name":"Martin Middendorf","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Middendorf","id":"37265567000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0708-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4223148","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","RNA","Genetic algorithms","Thermodynamics","Bioinformatics","Computer science","Predictive models","Proteins","Testing","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetic algorithms","macromolecules","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HelixPSO","particle swarm optimization","RNA secondary structures","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Genetic algorithms","RNA secondary structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223148","abstract":"This paper introduces the HelixPSO particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for finding minimum energy RNA secondary structures.

The network is used as a dynamic system modeling tool to identify the frequency-dependent impedances of power electronic systems such as rectifiers, inverters, and DC-DC converters. As a category of supervised learning methods, the various backpropagation training algorithms developed for recurrent neural networks use gradient descent information to guide their search for optimal weights solutions that minimize the output errors. While they prove to be very robust and effective in training many types of network structures, they suffer from some serious drawbacks such as slow convergence and being trapped at local minima. In this paper, a modified particle swarm optimization technique is used in combination with the backpropagation algorithm to traverse in a much larger search space for the optimal solution. The combined method preserves the advantages of both techniques and avoids their drawbacks. The method is implemented to train a RNN that successfully identifies the impedance characteristics of a three-phase inverter system. The performance of the proposed method is compared to those of both BP and PSO when used separately to solve the problem, demonstrating its superiority","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2007.368020","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223143/4223144/04223149.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2007.368020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Training of Recurrent Neural Networks with Particle Swarm Optimization and Backpropagation Algorithms for Impedance Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Combined Training of Recurrent Neural Networks with Particle Swarm Optimization and Backpropagation Algorithms for Impedance Identification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9507048","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4223149/","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Training of Recurrent Neural Networks with Particle Swarm Optimization and Backpropagation Algorithms for Impedance Identification","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SIS-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084296S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223143","isNumber":"4223144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223143","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4223144","articleId":"4223149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4223150,"authors":[{"name":"Y.G.

The tests show that using the PSO to control a swarm can successfully find the target, even in the presence of obstacles","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2007.368026","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223143/4223144/04223155.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2007.368026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Robotic Search Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223155/","displayDocTitle":"Using the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Robotic Search Applications","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4223155/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9507052","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Robotic Search Applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SIS-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045698S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223143","isNumber":"4223144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223143","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4223144","articleId":"4223155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4223160,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37687945800"},{"name":"Yupin Luo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yupin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37332831200"},{"name":"Shiyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279518100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0708-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4223160","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Stochastic processes","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic systems","Robustness","Convergence","History","Sufficient conditions","Analysis of variance","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stagnation analysis","particle swarm optimization","formal stochastic analysis"]}],"abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has shown to be an efficient, robust and simple optimization algorithm, and has been successfully applied to many different kinds of problems.

The standard PSO algorithm is here shown to be inadequate for optimisation tasks where such neutrality exists; we investigate modifications of a standard PSO and compare their performances on various novel fitness landscapes that contain neutrality. One simple modification to the standard PSO algorithm is shown to enable significantly improved functionality upon neutral landscapes, with no compromise to operation upon non-neutral terrains","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapting Particle Swarm Optimisation for Fitness Landscapes with Neutrality","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2007.367946","startPage":"258","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2007.367946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223144","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223143/4223144/04223183.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adapting Particle Swarm Optimisation for Fitness Landscapes with Neutrality","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4223183/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9507077","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting Particle Swarm Optimisation for Fitness Landscapes with Neutrality","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"SIS-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044602S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223143","isNumber":"4223144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223143","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4223144","articleId":"4223183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4223184,"authors":[{"name":"Ammar W.

Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(lscr) times the size of the block, where lscr is the number of servers. Finally, we discuss our implementation of these protocols, and measure their performance in order to determine their practicality.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2007.23","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223200/4223201/04223220.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2007.23","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","startPage":"131","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Robustness of Private Information Retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Robustness of Private Information Retrieval","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223220/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4223220/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10286352","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Robustness of Private Information Retrieval","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28480131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.147001S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223200","isNumber":"4223201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223200","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4223201","articleId":"4223220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4223233,"authors":[{"name":"Ted Huffmire","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ted","lastName":"Huffmire","id":"38572502900"},{"name":"Brett Brotherton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Brotherton","id":"37660138700"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291646300"},{"name":"Timothy Sherwood","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Sherwood","id":"37283546900"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner","id":"37266396600"},{"name":"Timothy Levin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Levin","id":"37372884800"},{"name":"Thuy Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thuy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37423336000"},{"name":"Cynthia Irvine","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Irvine","id":"37371838000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2848-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-6011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1207"}],"articleNumber":"4223233","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":518},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223233","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Embedded system","Silicon","Software prototyping","Prototypes","Resource management","Operating systems","Control systems","Security","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","microprocessor chips","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moats","drawbridges","isolation primitive","reconfigurable hardware based systems","custom designs","system development methodology","soft IP cores","operating system","interconnect traceability","secure reconfigurable broadcast","configuration scrubbing","FPGAs"]}],"abstract":"Blurring the line between software and hardware, reconfigurable devices strike a balance between the raw high speed of custom silicon and the post-fabrication flexibility of general-purpose processors. While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of \"soft IP cores,\" often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices. We carefully quantify the required overheads on real FPGAs and demonstrate the utility of our methods by applying them to the practical problem of memory protection.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2007.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2007.28","startPage":"281","endPage":"295","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223200/4223201/04223233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moats and Drawbridges: An Isolation Primitive for Reconfigurable Hardware Based Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223233/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Moats and Drawbridges: An Isolation Primitive for Reconfigurable Hardware Based Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"10286355","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4223233/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moats and Drawbridges: An Isolation Primitive for Reconfigurable Hardware Based Systems","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28480281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12442S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223200","isNumber":"4223201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223200","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4223201","articleId":"4223233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4223234,"authors":[{"name":"Dakshi Agrawal","affiliation":["IBM T.

This poses a significant security risk for ICs used for critical military and business applications. Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223234/","conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10286356","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4223234/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trojan Detection using IC Fingerprinting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trojan Detection using IC Fingerprinting","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28480296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099011S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223200","isNumber":"4223201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223200","citationCount":"451","xplore-issue":"4223201","articleId":"4223234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4223236,"authors":[{"name":"John Bethencourt","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bethencourt","id":"37689387400"},{"name":"Amit Sahai","affiliation":["UCLA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769300"},{"name":"Brent Waters","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Waters","id":"37529404500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2848-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-6011"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1207"}],"articleNumber":"4223236","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2018,"citationCountPatent":213,"totalDownloads":12211},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4223236","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Access control","Secure storage","Measurement","Personnel","File servers","Monitoring","Certification","Data security","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","distributed processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption","distributed system","policy enforcement","data confidentiality","trusted storage server","collusion attack","role-based access control"]}],"abstract":"In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user posses a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the confidentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.","doi":"10.1109/SP.2007.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4223201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SP.2007.11","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4223200/4223201/04223236.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4223236/","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"10286357","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4223236/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28480321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116674S","chronDate":"20-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4223200","isNumber":"4223201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4223200","citationCount":"2018","xplore-issue":"4223201","articleId":"4223236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4223238,"authors":[{"name":"Elaine Shi","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Shi","id":"37271533200"},{"name":"John Bethencourt","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bethencourt","id":"37689387400"},{"name":"T-H.

When network intrusions are suspected, an authority can release a key to an auditor, allowing the auditor to decrypt flows whose attributes (e.g., source and destination addresses, port numbers, etc.) fall within specific ranges. However, the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved. We formally define the security for MRQED and prove the security of our construction under the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decision linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups. We study the practical performance of our construction in the context of network audit logs.

Path constraints for routing are end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. We do not assume full cooperation for call forwarding and present a facile incentive mechanism to motivate the cooperation for call forwarding. We incorporate a realistic mobility model and dynamic call dropping notion in our system. Flat fading i.i.d Rayleigh channel is assumed between mobile nodes.

However, when the number of cognitive users tends to be very large, the bandwidth for reporting their sensing results to the common receiver will be very huge. In this paper, the authors employ a censoring method with quantization to decrease the average number of sensing bits to the common receiver. By censoring the collected local observations, only the users with enough information will send their local one bit decisions (0 or 1) to the common receiver. The performance of spectrum sensing is investigated for both perfect and imperfect reporting channels. Numerical results show that the average number of sensing bits decreases greatly at the expense of a little sensing performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios under Bandwidth Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios under Bandwidth Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582876","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios under Bandwidth Constraints","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050334S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4224252,"authors":[{"name":"Duo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37695091300"},{"name":"Zhi Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Tian","id":"37278997500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224252","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Narrowband","Ultra wideband technology","Chromium","Spread spectrum communication","Interference constraints","Capacity planning","Power system protection","Frequency conversion","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","ultra-wideband systems","spectrum sharing","channel multipath profile","licensed bands","orthogonal channelization","interference temperature constraint"]}],"abstract":"For cognitive wireless networks, this paper analyzes the achievable sum capacity of spectrum-sharing cognitive radio (CR) networks, taking into account of a number of factors including channel multipath profile, transmit power constraints, as well as the outage probability at a primary legacy user. Two transmission formats, narrowband versus ultra-wideband, are compared for adoption in CRs. Capacity analysis indicates that ultra-wideband CRs are in general more suitable for networks operating over licensed bands, when strict outage requirements are imposed for protecting primary users. On license-free bands, on the other hand, narrowband CRs employing orthogonal channelization offer higher network capacity, while its ultra-wideband counterparts become competitive only when the multipath effect is moderate. In the presence of primary users, the interference temperature constraint deteriorates a narrowband cognitive network more than its ultra-wideband counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224252.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Capacity of Cognitive Radio Networks: Narrowband Versus Ultra-Wideband Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Capacity of Cognitive Radio Networks: Narrowband Versus Ultra-Wideband Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224252/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224252/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582877","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Capacity of Cognitive Radio Networks: Narrowband Versus Ultra-Wideband Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041559S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224253,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boise State University, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Han","id":"37278605300"},{"name":"Charles Pandana","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Pandana","id":"37283688700"},{"name":"K.

In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum sharing among a primary user and multiple secondary users. We formulate this problem as an oligopoly market competition and use a Cournot game to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary users. Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We first present the formulation of a static Cournot game for the case when all secondary users can observe the adopted strategies and the payoff of each other. However, this assumption may not be realistic in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore, we formulate a dynamic Cournot game in which the strategy of one secondary user is selected solely based on the pricing information obtained from the primary user. The stability condition of the dynamic behavior for this spectrum sharing scheme is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.9","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Competitive Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Competitive Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224254/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582879","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Approach to Competitive Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S01P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061493S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4224256,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Peh","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Peh","id":"37294297800"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224256","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":324,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2656},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Frequency","Protection","FCC","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","TV","Detectors","Communications Society","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative systems","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative sensing","cognitive radio networks","detection probability","false alarm probability","signal to noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, the secondary users can use the frequency bands when the primary users are not present. Hence secondary users need to constantly sense the presence of the primary users. When the primary users are detected, the secondary users have to vacate that channel. This makes the probability of detection important to the primary users as it indicates their protection level from secondary users. When the secondary users detect the presence of a primary user which is in fact not there, it is referred to as false alarm. The probability of false alarm is important to the secondary users as it determines their usage of an unoccupied channel. Depending on whose interest is of priority, either a targeted probability of detection or false alarm shall be set. After setting one of the probabilities, the other can be optimized through cooperative sensing. In this paper, we show that cooperating all secondary users in the network does not necessary achieve the optimum performance, but instead, it is achieved by cooperating a certain number of users with the highest primary user's signal to noise ratio.

The secondary user is allowed to sense and to transmit in a single channel. By exploiting idle periods between bursty transmissions of primary users, and by using a periodic sensing strategy, optimal dynamic access is achieved by maximizing the throughput of the secondary user while constraining collision probability with the primary user. The optimal dynamic spectrum access problem can then be formulated within the framework of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). The optimal control policy is identified via a linear program, and its performance is analyzed numerically and through Monte Carlo simulations.

However, these objectives bring significant challenges and required functionalities such as spectrum sensing, sharing, management and mobility for the realization of cognitive radio networks (CRN). In particular, efficient spectrum sharing problem in cognitive radio communication is one of the most important problem which must be addressed in order to enhance the overall spectrum utilization in dynamic spectrum access environments. In this paper, we introduce a new BIOlogically-inspired spectrum sharing (BIOSS) algorithm which is based on the adaptive task allocation model in insect colonies. Without need for any coordination among the unlicensed users, BIOSS enables each unlicensed user to distributively determine the appropriate channel(s) over which it can communicate. Performance evaluations clearly reveal that BIOSS achieves efficient dynamic spectrum sharing with high spectrum utilization and without any coordination among the users and hence yielding no spectrum handoff latency overhead due to coordination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BIOlogically-Inspired Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224259.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"BIOlogically-Inspired Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224259/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582884","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BIOlogically-Inspired Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S02P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059186S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224260,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292078900"},{"name":"Tae Yoon Park","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Tae Yoon","lastName":"Park","id":"38257303400"},{"name":"Y.

The encoding of T is implemented by serially concatenating a multiplexer, a multilevel delay processor, and a signal mapper to the encoder of a conventional binary turbo code C. With such a construction, in T, there is some irregularity for the code bits in C. To provide more variety of irregularity, we can construct T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</sub>\n which is obtained by passing only a fraction of C through a multilevel delay processor and a signal mapper.

After decoding of one TP, according to the error bit positions, other TPs that will have the same decoded codeword are identified and rejected from decoding. In the mean time, if these TPs fall into the range of second half of TPs, their syndromes and metrics need not to be calculated either. Simulations results for TPCs built with eBCH(64,51,6,2) or eBCH(64,45,8,3) are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

To fulfill such a goal, we propose a cognitive MAC protocol using statistical channel allocation and call it SCA-MAC in this work. SCA-MAC is a CSMA/CA-based protocol, which exploits statistics of spectrum usage for decision making on channel access. For each transmission, the sender negotiates with the receiver on transmission parameters through the control channel. A model is developed for CR devices to evaluate the successful rate of transmission. A CR device should pass the threshold of the successful transmission rate via negotiation before it can begin a valid transmission on data channels. The operating range and channel aggregation are two control parameters introduced to maintain the MAC performance. To validate our ideas, we conducted theoretical analysis and simulations to show that SCA-MAC does improve the throughput performance and guarantee the interference to incumbents to be bounded by a predetermined acceptable rate. The proposed MAC protocol does not need a centralized controller, as the negotiation between the sender and the receiver is performed using the CSMA/CA-based algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cognitive MAC Protocol Using Statistical Channel Allocation for Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.25","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224270.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Cognitive MAC Protocol Using Statistical Channel Allocation for Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224270/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582895","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cognitive MAC Protocol Using Statistical Channel Allocation for Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S05P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044381S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4224271,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37384525400"},{"name":"Limin Xiao","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37367806200"},{"name":"Shidong Zhou","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shidong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854100"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224271","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":691},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Data communication","Chromium","Interference","Frequency","Communications Society","Laboratories","Information science","Wireless communication","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection time optimization","channel efficiency","cognitive radio systems","detection time selection","numerical optimization algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio (CR) systems, secondary users (SUs) have to detect the channel periodically during their data transmission to decide whether the channel is idle in order to avoid unacceptable interferences to primary users (PUs).

Also, the detection time needs to be adaptively adjusted due to path loss variations caused by movements of PUs and SUs.

According to these properties, an improved branch and bound algorithm which is more efficient than the general branch and bound algorithm is proposed for optimal power control optimization problem in cognitive radio network.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.27","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224272.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Control Under Interference Temperature Constraints in Cognitive Radio Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224272/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Control Under Interference Temperature Constraints in Cognitive Radio Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582897","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224272/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Control Under Interference Temperature Constraints in Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S05P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045532S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224273,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280758200"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Wang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405905200"},{"name":"Yin-Chih Lu","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yin-Chih","lastName":"Lu","id":"37696578200"},{"name":"Chuan-Ming Liu","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37423241200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224273","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Peer to peer computing","Chromium","Transmitters","Access protocols","Wideband","Interference","Communications Society","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","IEEE standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent transmission","MAC protocol","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","wideband sensing","multiple access protocol","CT-MAC scheme","IEEE 802.11 standard"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224273","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.28","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","abstract":"For the cognitive radio (CR) network, a fundamental issue is how to identify the spectrum opportunities. First, each CR node determines whether there exists transmission opportunities on unlicensed bands. If not, this node will find other opportunity on licensed bands. Thus, increasing the opportunities of concurrent transmissions in unlicensed bands can reduce the overhead of wide-band sensing. In this paper, based on the carrier sensing multiple access protocol, the paper proposed a novel concurrent transmissions MAC (CT-MAC) protocol to identify the possibility of establishing the second link in the presence of the first link in the unlicensed band. In addition to reducing the overhead of wide-band sensing, the proposed CT-MAC scheme can enhance overall throughput and is backward compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224273.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Concurrent Transmission MAC Protocol for Enhancing Throughout and Avoiding Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224273/","displayDocTitle":"A Concurrent Transmission MAC Protocol for Enhancing Throughout and Avoiding Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582898","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Concurrent Transmission MAC Protocol for Enhancing Throughout and Avoiding Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S05P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045145S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224274,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Yu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Yu","id":"37269376700"},{"name":"Emir Saric","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Emir","lastName":"Saric","id":"37297029800"},{"name":"Anfei Li","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Anfei","lastName":"Li","id":"37288889100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224274","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management","FCC","Bandwidth","Resource management","Dynamic programming","Communication system control","Estimation error","Chromium","Communications Society","Potential well"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","Markov processes","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic control","open spectrum management","licensed spectrum resources","secondary networks","spectrum broker","Markov decision process","dynamic programming","resource utilizations"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on sharing of open spectrum under a new sharing policy of prioritized dynamic spectrum leasing, where the designated spectrum broker dynamically allocates time-varying unused licensed spectrum resources to secondary networks of various access priorities. The proposed optimal stochastically controlled dynamic guard bandwidth (OSC-DGB) scheme enables the spectrum broker to adapt differentiated capacity limits of open spectrum for prioritized connection accesses by secondary networks in anticipation of their access request rates, which are expected to be opportunistic and non-stationary. The differences in capacity limits determine the amount of guard band reserved for the higher priority secondary networks. This spectrum adaptation problem is formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process to minimize service denials of secondary networks according to their spectrum access priorities, which is solved through dynamic programming.

The analysis shows that the mean-squared error (MSE) is linearly related to ELCIR. Tracking the variation in ELCIR is thus very important for conventional MLE. But, incorporating a run-time update of ELCIR into the ML estimator turns out to be computationally expensive. Therefore, a modified ML channel estimator, which combines the ML estimation with a frequency-domain smoothing technique, is proposed. The proposed method introduces no extra complexity, and its performance has been proved using theoretical analysis and simulations to be robust to variation in ELCIR. Numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed estimator under time-invariant and time-variant channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.37","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224282.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224282/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582907","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224282/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S07P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044776S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224283,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Liang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37690010500"},{"name":"Guo Jinjing","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Jinjing","id":"37694609900"},{"name":"Wang Yafeng","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yafeng","id":"37293740300"},{"name":"Yang Dacheng","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Dacheng","id":"37298691200"},{"name":"Zhang Xin","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xin","id":"37288177600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224283","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"An improved channel estimation scheme based on estimation of parameters is presented for frequency-selective MIMO channels.

Analyses are carried out for noncooperative and cooperative users in uplink and downlink static and Nakagami fading channels. The results are applied to a versatile multiple access channel model introduced in Nikjah and Beaulieu (2006). The model is based on the time-bandwidth dimensionality and is considered for the user capacity analysis of a variety of multiuser spread spectrum systems contaminated by jamming. It is found that the jammer should spread its energy evenly over all degrees of freedom in order to minimize the average capacity. Also, the capacity behavior appears to be dominated more by knowledge of jammer state information than by the effects of fading. The capacity of downlink channels in cooperative schemes is found to be more sensitive to changes in fading severity, compared with the capacity of other kinds of channels.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.41","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224286.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Jamming Capacity of General Multiuser CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224286/","displayDocTitle":"On Jamming Capacity of General Multiuser CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582911","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224286/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Jamming Capacity of General Multiuser CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S08P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0953S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224288,"authors":[{"name":"Catalin Lacatus","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Catalin","lastName":"Lacatus","id":"37427879100"},{"name":"Dimitrie C.

An automatic gain controller (AGC) acts to trace such unpredictable received signal variation in a timely manner so that the signal relatively remains at a desired level. In such condition, an ordinary AGC with single-rate accumulator does not improve the system performance; even worsen it at high noise power. This paper proposes a dual-rate AGC, where there are two different rates of sample accumulation, as a solution to improve the signal reception performance in such conditions. Results show that the dual-rate AGC significantly improves both the BER performance and the power level stability at the receiver. The AGC architecture is investigated through simulations in 3GPP WCDMA system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224290.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Rate Automatic Gain Controller for WCDMA Mobile Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Multiaccess communication","Fluctuations","Quantization","Mobile communication","Dynamic range","Communications Society","Communication system control","Control systems","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic gain control","code division multiple access","mobile radio","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-rate automatic gain controller","WCDMA mobile receiver","power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Rate Automatic Gain Controller for WCDMA Mobile Receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582915","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Rate Automatic Gain Controller for WCDMA Mobile Receiver","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S08P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037426S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224291,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Amleh","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, Intel Research Laboratories, Mont Alto, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Amleh","id":"37266003200"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224291","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224291","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Interference suppression","Filter bank","Narrowband","Channel estimation","OFDM","USA Councils","Interference elimination","Intersymbol interference","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint blind channel estimation","interference suppression","block transmission systems","zero padding","cyclic prefix","single-carrier systems","multicarrier systems","generalized multichannel minimum variance principle","equalizing filterbank","channel estimate"]}],"abstract":"Block transmission has recently been considered as an alternative to the conventional continuous transmission technique. In particular, block transmission techniques with zero padding (ZP) and cyclic prefix (CP) are becoming attractive procedures for their ability to eliminate both inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-block interference (IBI). In this paper, we present a unified approach to blind channel estimation and interference suppression for block transmission using ZP or CP in both single-carrier (SC) and multicarrier (MC) systems. Our approach uses a generalized multichannel minimum variance principle to design an equalizing filterbank. Channel estimate is then obtained from an asymptotically tight lower bound of the filterbank output power. Numerical examples show that the proposed schemes approach the CRB as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases. Additionally, they exhibit low sensitivity to unknown narrowband interference and compare favorably with subspace blind channel estimators.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224291.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach to Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Block Transmission Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Block Transmission Systems","htmlLink":"/document/4224291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9582916","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Interference Suppression for Block Transmission Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S09P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040811S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224292,"authors":[{"name":"Haris Gacanin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Haris","lastName":"Gacanin","id":"37280076500"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Graduate, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224292","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"abstract":"We present, in this paper, pilot-assisted channel estimation (CE) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing combined with time division multiplexing (OFDM/TDM) using minimum mean square error frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) over a nonlinear and frequency-selective fading channel.

However, in practice, users may be delay sensitive with heterogeneous delay requirements, and CSIT usually becomes outdated in time varying channel. When CSIT is outdated, there will always be systematic packet errors even if powerful channel coding is applied, resulting in significant degradation on the delay performance of heterogeneous users. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-sensitive cross-layer design framework for multi-user OFDMA systems with heterogeneous delay requirements in slow fading channels, by utilizing both queueing theory and information theory to model the system dynamics as well as accounting impacts upon outdated CSIT. Based on the framework, the optimal power and subcarrier allocation solution is shown to maintain heterogeneous users' delay constraints and guarantee a fixed target outage probability, and its asymptotic multi-user diversity gain over fixed allocation scheme is also obtained analytically. Simulation results further show that our proposed delay-sensitive CSIT error considerate schemes provide robust system performance enhancement over naive scheduler while satisfying heterogeneous delay requirements even at moderate to high CSIT errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer Designs for OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.55","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224300.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer Designs for OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224300/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582925","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Sensitive Cross-Layer Designs for OFDMA Systems with Outdated CSIT","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S11P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067383S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224302,"authors":[{"name":"Kemal Karakayali","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kemal","lastName":"Karakayali","id":"37589355200"},{"name":"Joseph H.

The network under consideration is assumed to consist of fixed mesh routers (or base station routers) inter-connected using OFDMA wireless links with some of the mesh routers functioning as gateways to a wired network. The objective of our cross-layer formulation is to allow joint determination of power control, frequency-selective OFDMA scheduling and multi-hop routing in order to maximize the minimum throughput that can be supported to all mesh routers. Results of our investigations under typical cellular deployment, propagation and channel model assumptions show that this approach achieves significant mesh throughput improvements primarily due to the following: (a) frequency selective scheduling with OFDMA which provides improved tone diversity thus allowing more efficient bandwidth utilization relative to single carrier methods; and (b) multi-hop routing which provides improved path diversity relative to single hop transmissions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for OFDMA-Based Wireless Mesh Backhaul Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.57","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224302.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for OFDMA-Based Wireless Mesh Backhaul Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224302/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582927","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Optimization for OFDMA-Based Wireless Mesh Backhaul Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S11P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047754S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224304,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293456700"},{"name":"Henry C.

However, better system performance (e.g., lower overall packet loss ratio (PLR)) can be achieved if BER and FDR are jointly optimized. This paper, the authors first set up a Markov chain model to evaluate the performance of transporting multimedia traffic over a multi-code CDMA network. Then, the authors propose two novel cross-layer optimization methods that dynamically adjust the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions according to the traffic arrival rate and the queue status, respectively. Simulation and analytical results show that these two methods can significantly reduce PLR and increase the system throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and

Furthermore, by taking full advantage of the residual excess powers, unequal error protection on important bits of video streams is provided by the LDPC code.

Conventional multi-user diversity schemes require all mobile terminals' channel state information to be available at the access point, thereby inducing huge system overhead. In this paper, we propose a user identification approach to significantly reduce system overhead for wireless network with multi-user diversity. The proposed user identification approach is then applied to OFDM systems. We shows that the network throughput upper limit can be significantly improved by using the user identification approach compared with the user polling approach in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.74","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224319.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Identification for Opportunistic OFDM Based Broadband Wireless Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User Identification for Opportunistic OFDM Based Broadband Wireless Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224319/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582944","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224319/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Identification for Opportunistic OFDM Based Broadband Wireless Network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S15P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059266S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224321,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Larsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Larsson","id":"37427263500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224321","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224321","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Unicast","Decoding","Throughput","Network coding","Telecommunication traffic","Feedback","Portable media players","Scheduling","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","encoding","probability","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser ARQ","multiple unicast flows","noniid reception probabilities","arbitrary reception probabilities","wise selection","joint encoding","scheduling approach","network coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.76","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224321.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Multi-User ARQ with Multiple Unicast Flows Under Non-iid Reception Probabilities","abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of multi-user ARQ for multiple unicast flows with arbitrary reception probabilities. The core idea of multi-user ARQ is to exploit knowledge of previously overheard packets by unintended users, and perform wise selection and joint encoding of any retransmitted information.

In this paper, a scheduling approach that balances the traffic shares and maximizes the throughput is proposed and analyzed. It is found that identical reception probabilities among the users yield the best performance and that the sensitivity in throughput efficiency, with respect to changes in reception probabilities, is reduced when the number of user increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224321/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9582946","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224321/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Multi-User ARQ with Multiple Unicast Flows Under Non-iid Reception Probabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Multi-User ARQ with Multiple Unicast Flows Under Non-iid Reception Probabilities","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S15P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040978S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224322,"authors":[{"name":"Sarma Vangala","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sarma","lastName":"Vangala","id":"37531583400"},{"name":"Hossein Pishro-Nik","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Pishro-Nik","id":"38278138700"},{"name":"Bharat Doshi","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Bharat","lastName":"Doshi","id":"37357720300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224322","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Interleaved codes","Automatic repeat request","Forward error correction","Throughput","Parity check codes","Delay","Error correction","Wireless communication","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","forward error correction","interleaved codes","Internet","parity check codes","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application performance","error prone routes","Internet","coding effect","interleaving effect","ARQ","voice traffic","video traffic","data traffic","error free transfer","forward error corrections","error controls","effective throughput","parameter optimization","LDPC codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224322","abstract":"Voice and video traffic can tolerate some errors in end-to-end transfer but require very low latency. Data traffic typically requires an almost error free transfer but can tolerate higher latency. Thus, coding and forward error corrections are the main mechanisms for error controls for voice and video traffic while ARQ is the main mechanism for error controls for data traffic. When the error rates are high (for example, in wireless links), it is beneficial to have both forward error corrections and ARQ for data traffic. In addition, the effectiveness of the coding and FEC can be improved by using interleaving. The combined effects of coding, interleaving, and ARQ on data traffic effective throughput is not well understood. In this paper, we take the first steps. In particular, we show the effective throughput is very sensitive to channel, coding, and interleaving parameters, thus identifying a need to study parameter optimization further. We also show that appropriately sized LDPC codes provide better throughput than traditional codes do. Early results also suggest that, for mixed traffic environment, it may pay to have some coding and interleaving be done at higher layer to allow application specific parameters.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.77","startPage":"389","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224322.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Application Performance Over Error Prone Routes in Internet: Joint Impact of Coding, Interleaving, and ARQ","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving Application Performance Over Error Prone Routes in Internet: Joint Impact of Coding, Interleaving, and ARQ","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224322/","accessionNumber":"9582947","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224322/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Application Performance Over Error Prone Routes in Internet: Joint Impact of Coding, Interleaving, and ARQ","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S15P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04107S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224326,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Einhaus","affiliation":["Communication Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Einhaus","id":"37297125800"},{"name":"Ole Klein","affiliation":["Communication Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ole","lastName":"Klein","id":"37702403600"},{"name":"Bernhard Walke","affiliation":["Communication Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Walke","id":"37268354600"},{"name":"Rudiger Halfmann","affiliation":["Communication Networks, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudiger","lastName":"Halfmann","id":"37332032700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224326","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Physical layer","Signal to noise ratio","Media Access Protocol","Channel coding","Interference","Frequency conversion","Communications Society","Communication networks","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete event simulation","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","performance evaluation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","OFDMA system","frequency correlated subchannel fading","MAC level simulations","medium access control scheme","stochastic event-driven simulations","resource scheduling"]}],"abstract":"This paper is focused on the performance evaluation of OFDMA systems under the consideration of frequency correlated subchannel fading.

Numerical results show that the performance gap between the optimal and sub-optimal receivers increases with increase of the channel correlation and the number of diversity branches, whereas it decreases with increase of pilot-to-signal ratio.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224339.pdf","endPage":"487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Receiver for MPSK Signaling with Imperfect Channel Estimation","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.94","startPage":"483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Receiver for MPSK Signaling with Imperfect Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224339/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9582964","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224339/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Receiver for MPSK Signaling with Imperfect Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S19P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055497S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224340,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Cheng","affiliation":["JRI in SIP, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37399092900"},{"name":"Cheng-Xiang Wang","affiliation":["JRI in SIP, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Cheng-Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292500000"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"},{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Hwa","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281172400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224340","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224340","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Tellurium","System performance","Equalizers","Computational complexity","Switches","Transmitters","Turbo codes","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","concatenated codes","convolutional codes","equalisers","iterative methods","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization","computational complexity","maximum a posteriori probability","extrinsic information transfer chart","iterative methods","parallel concatenation","serial concatenation","convolutional codes"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Iterative Method for Turbo Equalization","startPage":"488","endPage":"492","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.95","abstract":"A number of turbo equalization (TE) methods with reduced complexity have recently been introduced, in which the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalizer is replaced by suboptimal and low complexity ones. These methods can save the computational complexity significantly, but with sacrificed system performance. In this paper, the authors first use the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart tool to visually explain why these suboptimal methods have the worse performance. Then, the authors propose a novel iterative method for TE which takes advantage of both parallel and serial concatenation turbo-like schemes. In the novel iterative method, the EXIT chart switches between the two schemes as a balance. The transmitter side is also changed correspondingly by utilizing the concept of repetition code to acquire a structure similar to turbo codes. It is shown from both analytical and simulation results that the proposed iterative method for TE results in the excellent system performance while its realization complexity is kept relatively low.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224340/","accessionNumber":"9582965","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Iterative Method for Turbo Equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Iterative Method for Turbo Equalization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S20P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061405S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224346,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This check-node merging decoding not only needs smaller number of operations at each iteration but also shows faster decoding convergence speed than the conventional erasure decoding. For the binary erasure channel (BEC) and AWGN channel, the authors analyze and compare the check-node merging and the conventional erasure decoding schemes of the punctured LDPC codes with dual-diagonal parity structure using density evolution. Analytical results show that the check-node merging decoding gives faster convergence speed for both BEC and AWGN channel. Also, simulation results are provided to confirm the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.111","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224356.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Check-Node Merging Decoding for Punctured LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224356/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Check-Node Merging Decoding for Punctured LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224356/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Check-Node Merging Decoding for Punctured LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S23P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050131S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224358,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For a system with multiple transmit antennas, symbol shuffling scheme, together with an EST, has been proposed for transmit diversity. Even though symbol shuffling scheme alone is not as good as Alamouti's code, it can be combined with Alamouti's code to reach matched filter bound (MFB) for systems with over four transmit antennas. Comparison of our transmit-diversity approach with the widely used MMSE detection for MC-CDMA systems is also provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224363.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"615","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Diversity for Down-Link MC-CDMA Based on Energy Spreading Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Multiaccess communication","Data communication","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Power engineering and energy","Mobile communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","signal detection","transforms","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit diversity","energy spreading transform","MC-CDMA down-link mobile communications","code division multiple access","frequency-selective wireless channels","signal detection performance","bit-error-rate","indoor channel","urban channel","transmit antennas","Alamouti code","symbol shuffling scheme","matched filter bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Diversity for Down-Link MC-CDMA Based on Energy Spreading Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582988","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Diversity for Down-Link MC-CDMA Based on Energy Spreading Transform","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S25P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055216S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224365,"authors":[{"name":"Nevio Benvenuto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nevio","lastName":"Benvenuto","id":"37266482000"},{"name":"Paola Bisaglia","affiliation":["Dora Spa, STMicroelectronics Group, Aosta, Italy"],"firstName":"Paola","lastName":"Bisaglia","id":"37266639800"},{"name":"Federico Boccardi","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Swindon, Wiltshire, UK"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Boccardi","id":"37294661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224365","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Base stations","Loaded antennas","Iterative methods","Throughput","Power control","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","iterative decoding","precoding","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink MC-CDMA systems","post-detection techniques","iterative joint linear precoding","power allocation methods","multiple transmit antennas","base station","precoding coefficients","power control","multicarrier code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, as an alternative to post-detection techniques, we derive two iterative joint linear precoding and power allocation methods for downlink MC-CDMA systems with multiple transmit antennas at the base station. The first method optimally solves the so called assigned target SINRs problem, i.e. determines the precoding coefficients and the minimum sum-power allocation under a constraint on the SINR of each user. The second method instead solves the maximum sum-rate problem, i.e. maximizes the system throughput under a constraint on the overall transmit power. The main result of this paper is that the proposed joint precoding and power control solutions provide an advantage with respect to suboptimal solutions for a fully loaded system, i.e. when the number of users is equal to the spreading factor times the number of transmit antennas. For lower loads, performance of the various schemes becomes closer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoding for Downlink MC-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.120","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224365.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoding for Downlink MC-CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224365/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582990","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoding for Downlink MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S25P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086172S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224366,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Yang","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292058000"},{"name":"Emad Alsusa","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Alsusa","id":"37284811700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224366","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Fading","Partial transmit sequences","Power engineering and energy","Degradation","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","code division multiple access","Golay codes","Hadamard codes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic code-allocation","PAPR reduction technique","downlink MC-CDMA systems","multicarrier code division multiple access","high-data rate fourth generation wireless systems","multicarrier modulation","spreading codes","Walsh-Hadamard sequences","complementary Golay sequences"]}],"abstract":"Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA/OFDM-CDMA) is a promising candidate for future high-data rate fourth generation (4G) wireless systems. However multicarrier modulation tends to have a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) factor which leads to a significant degradation in the transmission power efficiency. In this paper we propose a PAPR reduction technique for the downlink MC-CDMA based on redistributing the spreading codes and optimizing the sequences with the objective to minimize the PAPR at the transmitter. Our technique utilizes the characteristic of the CDMA spreading codes as an extra degree of freedom that can be exploited to reduce the signal's PAPR without any loss in the system performance. Both lightly loaded and fully loaded systems are considered with the orthogonal sets of Walsh-Hadamard and complementary Golay sequences. It will be shown that our proposed technique requires very low complexity and only a few side information, while at the same time achieves significant PAPR reduction.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.121","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Code-Allocation Based PAPR Reduction Technique for MC-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Code-Allocation Based PAPR Reduction Technique for MC-CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224366/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582991","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224366/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Code-Allocation Based PAPR Reduction Technique for MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S25P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080223S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224367,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288835800"},{"name":"Daoben Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daoben","lastName":"Li","id":"37277108000"},{"name":"Xingpeng Mao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Xingpeng","lastName":"Mao","id":"37290014600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224367","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Convolutional codes","Fading","Diversity methods","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Frequency diversity","Convolution","Diversity reception","AWGN","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","fading channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier systems","diversity gain","multicarrier convolutional multiplexing","data symbols","convolutional spreader","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","spreading codes","frequency selective fading channels","free distance searching algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A new multiplexing scheme with high diversity gain for multicarrier systems, which is called multicarrier convolutional multiplexing (MCCM), is proposed.

The proposed encoding method is applicable to parity-check matrices having dual-diagonal parity structure with single column of weight 3. Unlike finding a direct solution for parity bits in schemes (Richardson and Urbanke, 2001 and Classon and Blankeship, 2004), the proposed scheme first generates arbitrary parity bits. Then, given the parity bits for the first sub-block and exploiting the dual-diagonal structure, all parity bits are found through correction. With slight modification of parity-check matrix H, proposed LDPC encoding scheme is directly applicable to matrices defined in IEEE physical layer standards with almost negligible performance loss. Moreover, the overall computational complexity involving encoding process is lower than well-known Richardson's efficient encoding scheme (Richardson and Urbanke, 2001).","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.127","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224372.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary Bit Generation and Correction Technique for Encoding QC-LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary Bit Generation and Correction Technique for Encoding QC-LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224372/","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9582997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary Bit Generation and Correction Technique for Encoding QC-LDPC Codes with Dual-Diagonal Parity Structure","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S27P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068825S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224373,"authors":[{"name":"Dongliang Xiao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Dongliang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37285287100"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University,Beijing 100084, ChinaEmail: lujh@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"},{"name":"Chunlei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Peking University,Beijing 100871, ChinaEmail: philippe\u2212lin@tom.com"],"firstName":"Chunlei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291396100"},{"name":"Bingli Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Peking University,Beijing 100871, ChinaEmail: jiaobl@pku.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Bingli","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37282213500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224373","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Perturbation methods","Parity check codes","Concatenated codes","Cyclic redundancy check","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Message passing","Joining processes","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","cyclic redundancy check codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","perturbation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perturbation method","low density parity check code","perturbation techniques","residual error","BP algorithm","LDPC decoding","iterative decoding algorithm","codeword length","cyclic redundancy check"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel decoding algorithm using perturbation techniques for LDPC concatenated with CRC (LDPC-CRC) is proposed.

Along with asymptotic performances analysis, the optimization of 'irregularity' profile for different channels and the performance analysis of practical finite-length codes has also been extensively explored. With multi-carrier communications becoming the physical layer choice for many emerging wireless systems, a feasible solution for optimizing the irregularity profile of irregular LDPC codes for a frequency selective channel is a problem of particular importance and interest. This paper proposes a simple-to-implement greedy 'check' allocation (GCA) based method for the construction of BER-optimized irregular LDPC codes using the criterion of Gallager upper bound (Gallager, 1962) for probabilistic decoding.

Although RA codes are very simple in terms of complexity compared to other codes such as turbo codes or low density parity check (LDPC) codes, the performance of these codes is quite competitive.

Moreover, the complexity of the proposed ML detector is further reduced with sacrificing slight performance loss, provided that the proposed DSTTD transmitter is used.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","Maximum likelihood decoding","Receiving antennas","Performance loss","Transmitters","Diversity methods","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","radio transmitters","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSTTD transceiver architecture","Schnorr-Euchner sphere decoding algorithm","maximum-likelihood detector","channel matrix","double space-time transmit diversity transceiver","low-complexity maximum-likelihood detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.144","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224389.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New DSTTD Transceiver Architecture for Low-Complexity Maximum-Likelihood Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New DSTTD Transceiver Architecture for Low-Complexity Maximum-Likelihood Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224389/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224389/","accessionNumber":"9583014","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New DSTTD Transceiver Architecture for Low-Complexity Maximum-Likelihood Detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S30P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04892S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224391,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Philips Research North America, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292144200"},{"name":"Jinyun Zhang","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jinyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463200"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modulation coding","Fading","Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Performance analysis","Wireless communication","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","fading channels","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonunitary super orthogonal differential space-time trellis coding","trellis decoding","quadrature amplitude modulation","suboptimal differential decoders","slow fading channels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224391","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224391.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Unitary Super Orthogonal Differential Space-Time Trellis Coding and Decoding","abstract":"In this paper, a non-unitary differential space-time coding scheme is proposed based on the super orthogonal space-time trellis coding scheme (SOSTTC).

In this paper, we address the routing issue from a link layer point of view. We focus on a multihop network with multiple relays at each hop and three routing strategies are designed to achieve the full diversity gain provided by the cooperation among relays. In particular, an optimal routing strategy is proposed to minimize the end-to-end outage, which requires the channel information of all the links and serves as a performance bound. An ad-hoc routing strategy is then proposed based on a hop-by-hop relay selection, which can be easily implemented in a distributed way. The outage analysis shows that the performance gap between these two routing strategies increases with the number of hops. To achieve a good complexity-performance tradeoff, a N-hop routing strategy is further proposed, where a joint optimization is performed every N hops. Simulation results are presented which verify the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224393.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"778","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Strategies in Multihop Cooperative Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Relays","Diversity methods","Fading","Wireless networks","Broadcasting","Routing protocols","Performance analysis","Communications Society","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","diversity reception","fading channels","optimisation","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop cooperative networks","fading characteristics","wireless channels","routing protocols","wireless networks","link layer","diversity gain","optimal routing strategy","channel information","ad-hoc routing strategy","hop-by-hop relay selection","outage analysis","joint optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Routing Strategies in Multihop Cooperative Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583018","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing Strategies in Multihop Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S31P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064417S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4224394,"authors":[{"name":"Shengli Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291013900"},{"name":"Yu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37292650600"},{"name":"Soung-Chang Liew","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Soung-Chang","lastName":"Liew","id":"37279300600"},{"name":"Khaled Ben Letaief","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Ben Letaief","id":"37275272700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224394","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":507},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Decoding","Wireless networks","Bit error rate","Throughput","Robustness","Performance analysis","AWGN channels","Channel capacity","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","combined source-channel coding","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","channel decoding","wireless networks","network throughput","network robustness","binary symmetric channel","AWGN channel","channel capacity","bit error rate","cooperative networks","log-likelihood ratio"]}],"abstract":"Network coding has been receiving much attention recently for its ability to improve network throughput and enhance network robustness.

The paper considers the scenario where one source and multiple partners cooperate to transmit messages to the destination. The powers emitted by the users are subject to the SNR requirement at the destination. First, the power allocation strategy that demands the minimum instantaneous aggregate transmit power of all cooperating partners is described and analyzed. The optimal solution results in a form of selective relaying; namely, the user with the best channel condition is selected to help in relaying the message. However, this instantaneous power minimization strategy does not necessarily maximize the lifetime of battery-limited systems. Then, three AF cooperative schemes were proposed to exploit the channel state information (CSI), the residual battery energy and the QoS requirement. It is shown that the network lifetime can be extended considerably by taking all these three factors into account.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224400.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"818","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lifetime Maximization for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system relaying","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","MIMO","Relays","Channel state information","Costs","Antenna arrays","Strontium","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward cooperative networks","cooperative network lifetime maximization","power allocation strategy","selective relaying","power minimization strategy","battery-limited systems","channel state information","QoS requirement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Lifetime Maximization for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224400/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583025","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifetime Maximization for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S32P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050627S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4224401,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Darmawan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Darmawan","id":"37689748200"},{"name":"Sang W.

scheme. It combines the spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing in order to exploit the benefits of both techniques. The transmit antennas are divided into several layers and each layer is encoded by STBC. The antennas transmit OFDM signals in order to deal with frequency-selective fading channels. In addition to exhaustive detection scheme which applies the same detection at each subcarrier independently, the subcarrier correlation was exploited to develop two subcarrier-grouping based detection schemes. The subcarriers bound into the same group share the same detection parameters, e.g., layer detection order or nulling matrices, which are obtained at the center subcarrier of that group. The proposed schemes can significantly reduce the complexity with very small performance loss. The simulation results show that compared with exhaustive detection scheme, the propose detection scheme is capable of reducing 51.79% complexity with only 0.5dB performance loss for 4times4 system, and reducing 69.96% complexity with only 1.0dB performance loss for 6times6 system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224405/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9583030","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224405/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier-Grouping Based Detection Schemes for Multi-Layer STBC Coded MIMO-OFDM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier-Grouping Based Detection Schemes for Multi-Layer STBC Coded MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S33P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060471S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224406,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37271340300"},{"name":"Norman C.

ISI occurs due to the violation of the 'quasi-static' fading assumption caused due to frequency- and/or time-selectivity of the channel. In addition, ICI occurs due to time-selectivity of the channel which results in loss of orthogonality among the subcarriers. This paper is concerned with the detection of SFBC-OFDM signals on time- and frequency-selective MIMO channels. Specifically, the performance of an interference cancelling receiver for SFBC-OFDM which alleviates the effects of ISI and ICI in highly time- and frequency-selective channels was proposed and evaluated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of SFBC-OFDM Signals in Frequency and Time-Selective MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.162","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224407.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Detection of SFBC-OFDM Signals in Frequency and Time-Selective MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224407/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583032","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of SFBC-OFDM Signals in Frequency and Time-Selective MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S34P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05286S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224408,"authors":[{"name":"Jichao Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jichao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37695387700"},{"name":"Guixia Kang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guixia","lastName":"Kang","id":"37290963700"},{"name":"Shan Lu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37696050800"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224408","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"A novel preamble sequence design for random access using complete complementary code sets in multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) scheme is proposed.

The partial linear approaches mitigate the ICI effects with banded submatrices, instead of full channel frequency response (CFR) matrix. For further improvement of BER performance, the partial SQRD-based DFD with a modified ordering criterion is developed, which effectively removes above two types of interferences including inter-STTD-unit interference simultaneously.

A popular suboptimal scheme is the so-called soft interference cancellation plus minimum mean-square error (SIC-MMSE) detection that uses the a priori information from the outer decoder(s) to perform soft interference cancellation before the linear MMSE detection. In addition to the outer decoder outputs, channel observation also provides useful information for the interferences. Motivated by this observation, a new soft-output multi-user detection scheme was proposed that uses both the decoder and the detector outputs of the previous iteration as the a priori information. A nonlinear MMSE estimator is developed that takes these two \"a priori\" information sources to produce soft interference estimates before interference cancellation and linear MMSE detection. In one iteration, the proposed scheme has comparable complexity as that of the SIC-MMSE scheme. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme leads to a convergence point with higher output mutual information but with significantly less iterations. As a result, considerable performance improvement is achieved with lower complexity when compared to conventional SIC-MMSE-based turbo multi-user receiver.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.175","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"922","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224420.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Interference cancellation","Detectors","MIMO","Analytical models","Convergence","Demodulation","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interference suppression","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo multiuser receiver","recursive SIC-MMSE detection","inner detection","soft interference cancellation","minimum mean-square error detection","soft-output multiuser detection","a priori information","extrinsic information transfer chart analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Turbo Multi-User Receiver With Recursive SIC-MMSE Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224420/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224420/","accessionNumber":"9583045","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Turbo Multi-User Receiver With Recursive SIC-MMSE Detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S36P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136504S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4224421,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37674715900"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhongshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279639900"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224421","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Diversity reception","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio analysis","MIMO-OFDM","carrier frequency offset","channel estimation errors","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","frequency-selective Rayleigh fading","intercarrier interference","equal gain combining","maximal ratio combining"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the authors derive the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of frequency offset and channel estimation errors.

In this paper, we extend DPC-OF/TDMA to support higher data rates with the same bandwidth of its original version. The evolved DPC-OF/TDMA is based on our newly proposed multi-layer STBC OFDM (multi-layer space-time block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) scheme. This scheme combines the spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing in order to exploit the benefits of both techniques. To evaluate the performance of the evolved DPC-OF/TDMA, we conduct simulations under different MIMO antenna configurations. As the packet error rate (PER) is required to be 1.0e-2 with Eb/No lower than 20.0dB, the evolved DPC-OF/TDMA can reach data rate of 921.6Mbps while the bandwidth is 128MHz. The achieved average spectral efficiency is 7.2bit/s/Hz.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.178","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224423.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Data-Rate DPC-OF/TDMA Based on Multi-Layer STBC Coded MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224423/","displayDocTitle":"High-Data-Rate DPC-OF/TDMA Based on Multi-Layer STBC Coded MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224423/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Data-Rate DPC-OF/TDMA Based on Multi-Layer STBC Coded MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S37P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051057S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224424,"authors":[{"name":"Changkee Min","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changkee","lastName":"Min","id":"37686179700"},{"name":"Namseok Chang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namseok","lastName":"Chang","id":"37694039000"},{"name":"Jongsub Cha","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongsub","lastName":"Cha","id":"37289272900"},{"name":"Joonhyuk Kang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joonhyuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37288717500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224424","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":750},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Bit error rate","Channel state information","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Channel estimation","Kalman filters","Nonlinear filters","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Kalman filters","least mean squares methods","metropolitan area networks","MIMO communication","mobile computing","OFDM modulation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM downlink channel prediction","IEEE802.16e systems","Kalman filter","channel state information","multiple-input multiple-output downlink","MMSE channel estimation","linear interpolation","precoding weighing"]}],"abstract":"Channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink systems is indispensable to beamforming or precoding to take advantage of MIMO capacity. In time-division duplex (TDD) systems, CSI for downlink can be obtained from uplink channel using reciprocity. However, the CSI from uplink is not accurate enough to keep track of the continuously varying channel characteristic in downlink period. In this paper, a MIMO-OFDM downlink channel prediction technique based on Kalman filter is proposed for IEEE802.16e systems. The proposed method consists of three procedures: MMSE channel estimation, Kalman filtering and prediction, and linear interpolation. Kalman filter is employed to filter the estimated channel and to predict the next channel sample to determine the precoding weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the bit error rate (BER) performance significantly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Downlink Channel Prediction for IEEE802.16e Systems Using Kalman Filter","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.179","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224424.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM Downlink Channel Prediction for IEEE802.16e Systems Using Kalman Filter","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224424/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583049","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM Downlink Channel Prediction for IEEE802.16e Systems Using Kalman Filter","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S37P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052621S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224425,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292301100"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280588900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224425","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","OFDM","Media Access Protocol","MIMO","Access protocols","Downlink","Wireless communication","Interchannel interference","Timing","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM transceiver","power-saving MAC","WLAN","multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","physical-layer techniques","cross-layer approach","PSM-MIMO/OFDM","downlink transceiver","access point","IEEE 802.11","ad-hoc traffic indication message window","multiuser diversity"]}],"abstract":"The combination of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is regarded as one of the most promising solutions for improving spectrum efficiency and enhancing data rate for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, the applications of these advanced physical-layer techniques also impose great challenges on upper layer protocol designs. In this paper, a cross-layer approach was proposed to exploring the utility of the joint design of multiuser MIMO-OFDM technique and power-saving MAC protocol. Specifically, a novel MIMO-OFDM transceiver architecture and an improved power-saving MAC protocol (namely, PSM-MIMO/OFDM) are proposed. In the proposed downlink transceiver architecture, by processing the data according to the channel state, the access point (AP) makes the data for one user appear as zero at the other user on each subcarrier such that it can send distinct packets to two users simultaneously. In the dual uplink, two users can concurrently transmit data to the AP without co-channel interference by uplink-downlink duality. The key ideas of PSM-MIMO/OFDM can be summarized as follows. A similar timing structure was employed to IEEE 802.11 power-saving mechanism (PSM). By utilizing ATIM (ad-hoc traffic indication message) window, negotiations are conducted between the AP and multiple candidate users via ATIM messages to achieve multiuser diversity gains. At the end of ATIM window, the AP sends an additional beacon to indicate the estimated time duration for data exchange with the measurement result of the number of active links which have been successfully negotiated during ATIM window. The length of a beacon interval is adjustable to satisfy the requirements of active links to the maximum extent. During the data exchange, the AP always communicates with two compatible users simultaneously both in the downlink and uplink, which effectively creates extra dimensions in the spatial domain. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results demonstrate that the new protocol significantly outperforms other power-saving MAC protocols with only minimum additional overhead and minor modifications to the IEEE 802.11 PSM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Design of MIMO-OFDM Transceiver and Power-Saving MAC in WLANs","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.180","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224425.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Design of MIMO-OFDM Transceiver and Power-Saving MAC in WLANs","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224425/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Design of MIMO-OFDM Transceiver and Power-Saving MAC in WLANs","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S37P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060274S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224426,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Jiang","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37687040800"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293664100"},{"name":"Guangyi Liu","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293589300"},{"name":"Xi Fang","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Fang","id":"37693689200"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224426","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency diversity","System performance","Scheduling algorithm","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Singular value decomposition","OFDM","Broadband antennas","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","greedy algorithms","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","scheduling","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser spatial diversity","MIMO-OFDM system","uplink scheduling","multiuser singular value decomposition","singular vector correlation","greedy scheduling algorithm","orthogonal spatial subchannel","maximum singular mode"]}],"abstract":"Through exploiting the multiuser diversity, the capacity of MIMO-OFDM system can increase dramatically.

In this paper, we propose an OFDM-based selective relaying scheme, where the relay selection at each hop is performed on a per-subcarrier basis and joint selection is adopted at the last two hops. The outage analysis clearly shows that full spatial diversity gain can be achieved with this proposed selective OFDMA relaying. In contrast, no diversity gain can be obtained if the entire OFDM block chooses the same relay with the highest combined SNR. It is also demonstrated that with coding among the subcarriers, superior performance can be achieved by selective OFDMA relaying with only symbol detection at each relay.

We first analyze a baseline scheme, called static relaying, where the relaying decisions are based only on the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of all the links. The second scheme, dynamic relaying, allows the relay to make decisions based on the instantaneous SNR of the source-relay link and average SNRs of the relay-destination and source-destination links. We show that, in dynamic relaying the optimal strategy to minimize the average end-to-end bit error rate is a threshold rule on the instantaneous SNR of the source-relay channel. In this case, the optimal threshold value is a function of average SNR of relay-destination and source-destination channels. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal threshold and the bit error performance achieved by this threshold. We show that dynamic relaying can provide significant performance advantage over static relaying.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Threshold for SNR-Based Selective Digital Relaying Schemes in Cooperative Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.184","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224429.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Threshold for SNR-Based Selective Digital Relaying Schemes in Cooperative Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224429/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583054","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Threshold for SNR-Based Selective Digital Relaying Schemes in Cooperative Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S38P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043262S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224430,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Shi","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Shi","id":"37691679000"},{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guanding","lastName":"Yu","id":"37288513300"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279636300"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293321600"},{"name":"Peiliang Qiu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peiliang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37267267500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224430","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224430","abstract":"In this paper, the issue of partial channel state information (CSI) based cooperative relaying and partner selection is discussed. First, we propose a new selection relaying scheme which switches between two fixed modes: direct transmission, and regenerative relaying cooperation. Unlike the existing scheme which employs instantaneous source-relay channel gain as criteria of the switching, we utilize only the geographical information of source, relay and destination terminals. Then, in order to apply our proposed scheme to large-scale networks, a cooperative partner selection protocol based on min-max criteria is introduced. We consider the scenario that all the nodes try to transmit packets to the same access point (AP) in a round-robin manner, and the AP tries to select a cooperative partner for each node utilizing the geographical information of nodes. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed selection relaying scheme can efficiently minimize the outage probability by properly choosing the dominant transmission mode. And our partner selection protocol based on the min-max criteria outperforms both the random partner selection strategy and the fixed non-cooperative strategy in terms of outage probability while ensuring fairness among users.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"975","endPage":"979","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224430.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Channel State Information Based Cooperative Relaying and Partner Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Relays","Protocols","Decoding","Peer to peer computing","Large-scale systems","Numerical simulation","Transmitting antennas","Wireless sensor networks","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial channel state information","cooperative relaying","direct transmission","regenerative relaying cooperation","instantaneous source-relay channel gain","geographical information","source terminals","relay terminals","destination terminals","large-scale networks","cooperative partner selection protocol","min-max criteria","numerical simulation","selection relaying scheme","probability","dominant transmission mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Partial Channel State Information Based Cooperative Relaying and Partner Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224430/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224430/","accessionNumber":"9583055","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Channel State Information Based Cooperative Relaying and Partner Selection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S38P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14315S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224431,"authors":[{"name":"Poramate Tarasak","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Poramate","lastName":"Tarasak","id":"37271202900"},{"name":"Yong Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Hoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281120300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224431","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading","Throughput","OFDM","Frequency diversity","Frequency domain analysis","Aggregates","Delay effects","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","OFDM modulation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint cooperative diversity","scheduling","OFDMA relay systems","frequency-flat fading relay systems","frequency-selective fading relay systems","time-varying phase rotation","fixed cyclic delay times","cyclic delay diversity","MIMO-OFDM system","multiuser relay system","multipath diversity","multiuser diversity"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by joint cooperative diversity and scheduling (JCDS) in frequency-flat fading relay systems, this paper proposes JCDS for frequency-selective fading relay systems with an OFDMA technique.

This technique can be considered as an extension of cyclic delay diversity in a conventional MIMO-OFDM system to a multiuser relay system in order to gain both multipath diversity and multiuser diversity. It is shown that JCDS using fixed cyclic delay has significant gains in aggregate throughput while per-link throughput can be maintained when there are enough relays.

Conventionally, partial-cancelation-factors (PCFs) are optimally derived and kept constant in a designated interval. Recently, a special kind of partial PIC was proposed. In the approach, PCFs are adaptively trained (chip-by-chip) using the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, and PCFs are updated with a bit-by-bit fashion. It has been shown that the adaptive partial PIC detector outperforms conventional partial PIC. Despite its good performance, performance analysis of the approach has not been explored yet. This paper is aimed to fill the gap by conducting the performance analysis of an adaptive two-stage partial PIC detector. We first analyze optimal weights (i.e., PCFs), weight error means, and weight error variances. Simulation results indicates that our analytical results highly agree with empirical ones.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Interference cancellation","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance analysis","Analytical models","AWGN","Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight behavior analysis","adaptive receivers","adaptive detector","performance analysis","adaptive partial detector","least-mean-square algorithm","partial-cancelation-factors","DS/CMDA systems","multiuser detection technique","partial parallel-interference-cancelation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.188","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224433.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weight Behavior Analysis of Adaptive Two-Stage Partial PIC Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weight Behavior Analysis of Adaptive Two-Stage Partial PIC Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224433/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224433/","accessionNumber":"9583058","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight Behavior Analysis of Adaptive Two-Stage Partial PIC Receivers","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S39P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059936S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224434,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In practical uplink OFDMA systems (e.g., IEEE 802.16e standard), effect of this MUI is made acceptably small by requiring that frequency/timing alignment be achieved at the receiver with high precision (e.g., CFO must be within 1 % of the subcarrier spacing and TO must be within l/8th of the cyclic prefix duration in IEEE 802.16e), which is realized using complex closed-loop frequency/timing correction between the transmitter and the receiver. An alternate open-loop approach to handle the MUI induced by large CFOs and TOs is to employ interference cancellation techniques at the receiver. In this paper, we first analytically characterize the degradation in the average output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) due to the combined effect of large CFOs and TOs in uplink OFDMA. We then propose a parallel interference canceller (PIC) for the mitigation of interference due to CFOs and TOs in this system. We show that the proposed PIC effectively mitigates the performance loss due to CFO/TO induced interference in uplink OFDMA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIR Analysis and Interference Cancellation in Uplink OFDMA with Large Carrier Frequency and Timing Offsets","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.189","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224434.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"SIR Analysis and Interference Cancellation in Uplink OFDMA with Large Carrier Frequency and Timing Offsets","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224434/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583059","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIR Analysis and Interference Cancellation in Uplink OFDMA with Large Carrier Frequency and Timing Offsets","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S39P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069759S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224435,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenning Shi","affiliation":["National ICT Australia, Research, Australian National University, Braddon, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhenning","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278371900"},{"name":"Mark C.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of timing offset on the performance of a recently proposed subspace based joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation scheme. It is found that this scheme is highly sensitive to timing offsets. An improved timing robust scheme is then proposed. In the proposed CFO estimation scheme, the orthogonality loss between two subspaces due to timing offset is restored by exploiting a reduced null-subspace. The missing taps in the original channel estimate are recovered by using an upper bound of the channel length instead of the actual value. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.194","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Robust Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Timing Robust Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224439/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583064","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224439/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Robust Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S40P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082345S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224440,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Deuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Deuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37697308900"},{"name":"Youn-Shik Byun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youn-Shik","lastName":"Byun","id":"37277402800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224440","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Independent component analysis","Bandwidth","Interference","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Wireless communication","Frequency synchronization","Communications Society","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","independent component analysis","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier frequency offset estimation","CP-ICA scheme","OFDM systems","inter-carrier interference","OFDM symbol","OFDM receiver","ICI cancellation algorithm","cyclic prefix-independent component analysis","subcarriers phase rotation","statistical blind estimation method","eigenvalue decomposition","rotating phasor"]}],"abstract":"A well-known problem of OFDM is its sensitivity to carrier frequency offset which leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM symbol.

The size of search space in the algorithm is not dependent on the maximum number of transmission but only on the number of transmit antennas.

Optimal MIMO detection entails maximizing or marginalizing a likelihood function over a very large set of vectors. Similar to other low-complexity detection schemes such as sphere decoding, the SD approach restricts the maximization/marginalization to a small set of candidate vectors.

Unfortunately, these techniques require accurate channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for their proper operation. In practice however perfect CSIT is hard to obtain due to capacity-limited feedback channel in FDD systems for example. In this paper we investigate systems employing MU-MIMO decomposition transmission in the downlink with limited feedback. In particular, the essential information that enables the scheme to deal with inter-user interference is identified and the optimal codebook design in terms of minimizing the residual inter-user interference power is derived. Simulation results show that in general limited feedback has a significant impact on the mutual information achieved by MU-MIMO decomposition transmission.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.210","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MU-MIMO Decomposition Transmission with Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MU-MIMO Decomposition Transmission with Limited Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583080","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MU-MIMO Decomposition Transmission with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S44P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055278S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224456,"authors":[{"name":"Jinliang Huang","affiliation":["Electronic Computer and Software Systems, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jinliang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293537000"},{"name":"Svante Signell","affiliation":["Electronic Computer and Software Systems, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Svante","lastName":"Signell","id":"37270081300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224456","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":163},"abstract":"Adaptive MQAM modulation is used to maximize spectral efficiency while keeping bit error rate (BER) under a target level.

They have shown that the virtual receive antennas created by repeating the same transmit symbols several times can improve the outage rate of slow MIMO fading channels, especially if the number of transmit antennas is smaller than the number of receive antennas. Inspired by (Rankin, 2006) we propose in this paper two novel channel augmentation schemes which have the same complexity as the RTM scheme. In the first scheme, the transmitted symbols are not only repeated but also complex conjugated leading to the conjugate virtual antenna (CVA) scheme. In the second scheme, the transmitted symbols are constrained to be real-valued leading to the real virtual antenna (RVA) scheme. We show that the RTM, CVA, and RVA schemes can achieve a higher outage rate than the baseline scheme without augmentation for both V-BLAST and D-BLAST. Thereby, the novel RVA and CVA schemes are more robust to channel correlations than the RTM scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224458.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1128","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Novel Channel Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Fading","RAKE receivers","Transmitters","Signal processing","Channel capacity","Decoding","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel augmentation schemes","MIMO systems","multiple input multiple output systems","virtual receive antennas","MIMO fading channels","transmit antennas","conjugate virtual antenna scheme","real virtual antenna scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Two Novel Channel Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583083","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Novel Channel Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S44P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065539S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224459,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37697204800"},{"name":"Changqing Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Changqing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309396300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224459","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Downlink","Base stations","Iterative decoding","Channel state information","Mean square error methods","Iterative algorithms","Performance loss","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","decoding","iterative methods","linear codes","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoders","linear decoders","multiuser MIMO downlink","CSI","base station","channel state information","sum mean square error","iterative procedure","optimization algorithm","single-user MIMO system"]}],"abstract":"A robust scheme is proposed to optimize the linear precoders/decoders for MIMO downlinks where the available channel state information (CSI) at base station (BS) is imperfect.

In practice, only limited CSIT knowledge is usually available. In most existing works, the focus was on the precoder and power adaptation design for i.i.d. MIMO channels to optimize the ergodic capacity or SNR. The issues of rate adaptation and spatial correlation between antennas, which plays a key role in the overall system performance in slow fading channels, has been ignored in the existing works. In this paper, we shall propose an integrated framework for the rate and precoder adaptation under limited feedback for slow and spatially correlated MIMO fading channels. To capture the effects of potential packet errors, we consider average system goodput, which measures the b/s/Hz successfully delivered to the receiver, as our performance measure. The average system goodput is maximized subject to a total transmit power constraint and a target frame error rate (FER) constraint. Simulation results show our integrated design outperforms the Grassmannian precoder design in i.i.d. and spatially correlated MIMO channels. Furthermore, the limited feedback efficiency increases as the correlation coefficient increases.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.218","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224463.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Rate and Precoder Design for Slow Fading Correlated MIMO Channels with Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224463/","displayDocTitle":"Combined Rate and Precoder Design for Slow Fading Correlated MIMO Channels with Limited Feedback","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583088","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224463/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Rate and Precoder Design for Slow Fading Correlated MIMO Channels with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S45P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068362S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224464,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, UESTC, Chengdu, China","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37087022183"},{"name":"Anthony C.

It is shown by computer simulation that, compared with the existing method, the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a 1% bit-error rate (BER) is reduced by over 2 dB for a system with 4 transmit antennas and 2 users when the variance of the CSI is -20 dB. The performance gain increases with the number of transmit antennas when the number of users is fixed. The required SNR for a 1% BER is reduced by over 4 dB if the the number of transmitter antennas is 8.

For coarse timing synchronization, a sliding window differentiator is used after a conventional autocorrelation device so that the timing ambiguity caused by the auto-correlation metric plateau can be removed. For fine timing synchronization, a metric called signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is devised. Based on this metric, a fine timing synchronization method is developed to improve the timing precision. Compared with the conventional cross-correlation synchronization methods, this method is more robust to multipaths and pseudo multipaths caused by the cyclic delay diversity (CDD) scheme, which may be adopted in the next generation WLAN IEEE 802.11n system.

We consider an approach where the mobile receiver estimates the downlink channel and chooses one of the predefined channel characterization codewords whose indices are transmitted back to the base station transmitter. In practice, the feedback channel introduces delay in transmission of the indices and we evaluate the resulting channel throughput loss for different system setups. Moreover, we define two new parameters of VQ MIMO systems: the channel eigenmode coherence time and singular value coherence time, and discuss their influence on system design. We demonstrate the performance of two types of systems, one using time division multiplexing of individual mobile users and another transmitting to multiple users at the same time. The simulation results show that feedback delay sensitivity of the multiple-user system throughput is much higher than in the TDM approach. Based on those results we propose a simple method allowing a selection of the VQ resolution for the given channel characteristics and system setup.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.225","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1188","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of CSI Feedback Delay on Capacity of Linear Multi-User MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of CSI Feedback Delay on Capacity of Linear Multi-User MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224470/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583095","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224470/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of CSI Feedback Delay on Capacity of Linear Multi-User MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S47P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043953S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224471,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Kaiser","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269751800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224471","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"The performance of spatial pre-coding schemes depends on the amount of channel state information available at the transmitter. A novel approach is spatial pre-coding with phase flipping investigated in this paper. The scheme is referred to as spatial phase coding (SPQ). Two flipping criteria, the angle criterion (AC) and the absolute value criterion (AVC), are proposed which change the phase relation of the signals between multiple transmit antennas such that the probability of constructive superposition of the signals at the receiver antenna is increased. Compared to known pre-coding schemes, SPC AVC does not need knowledge about the channel from each transmit antenna for pre-coding. Instead, it requires only information about the absolute value of the superimposed channel. This paper shows that SPC can achieve an array gain additional to the diversity gain. This is not possible with schemes like transmitter antenna selection diversity (SD). The lower bounds for SPC are defined by equal gain transmission (EGT) and maximum ration transmission (MRT).","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224471.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1198","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Pre-Coding with Phase Flipping for Wireless Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Automatic voltage control","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Performance gain","Bit error rate","Throughput","Robustness","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel coding","phase coding","precoding","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase flipping","wireless communications","spatial pre-coding schemes","channel state information","spatial phase coding","angle criterion","absolute value criterion","transmit antennas","receiver antenna","array gain","diversity gain","equal gain transmission","maximum ration transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Pre-Coding with Phase Flipping for Wireless Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583096","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Pre-Coding with Phase Flipping for Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S47P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055103S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224472,"authors":[{"name":"Massimiliano Siti","affiliation":["Advanced System Technologies, STMicroelectronics, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Siti","id":"37391665400"},{"name":"Michael P.

This paper presents a near-optimal layer ordering technique applicable to the hard-output version of the algorithm, essential to achieve near-ML performance up to high-dimensional MIMO systems. The Euclidean distance metrics are minimized over a constant number of transmit sequences, a property desirable to maintain constant throughput and not guaranteed by the most known sphere decoder. Differently from previous art works, attention is also paid to the optimization of the implementation complexity. Finally, it is also shown how the above mentioned ordering technique should be modified for the soft-output version of the algorithm, significantly improving the performance of MIMO-OFDM BICM systems.

The use of orthogonal transmission enables the transmitter to calculate exact signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values during the user selection process. The knowledge of multiuser interference proves to be of particular importance for user scheduling as both the number of users in the cell and the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decrease. The sum capacity of our scheme is characterized in the low-SNR regime, providing analytical results on the performance gain over zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF).

However, OFDM is very sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO). For conventional communication system, only one CFO exists and its effect is easy to be compensated. But for cooperative communication, the CFO between each relay and destination may be very different. These multiple CFO make frequency compensation difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, we propose a detection scheme for SF codes which can work much better than the conventional SISO zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) methods. Moreover, parallel interference cancellation (PIC) can be used to further improve the system performance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme combined with PIC is capable to achieve almost the same performance as cases without CFO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Detection for Space-Frequency Coded Cooperative Communication System with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.231","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224476.pdf","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Signal Detection for Space-Frequency Coded Cooperative Communication System with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224476/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583101","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Detection for Space-Frequency Coded Cooperative Communication System with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S48P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041961S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224479,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Nagy","affiliation":["ISI/ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37282837100"},{"name":"Mark C.

Successive least squares (SLS) channel estimation through linear interpolation is performed by using more than one symbol in the LS estimator introducing the weight channel change (WCC) factor that represents the change of the wireless channel between the successive symbols used. A novel analysis deriving exact expressions for the mean square error (MSE) as a function of pilot spacing, channel statistics and WCC for an OFDM system where data subcarriers also exist before the first and after the last pilot is given. The MSE and the bit error rate (BER) of the estimator are characterized by the number and distance of the pilots, the Doppler spread and the WCC factor. Simulations show the effect of each factor on MSE and BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.236","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224481.pdf","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Performance Evaluation of a K-Symbol Pilot Assisted Channel Estimator using Linear Interpolation for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224481/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Performance Evaluation of a K-Symbol Pilot Assisted Channel Estimator using Linear Interpolation for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583106","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224481/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Performance Evaluation of a K-Symbol Pilot Assisted Channel Estimator using Linear Interpolation for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S48P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059231S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224482,"authors":[{"name":"Benoit Le Saux","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Le Saux","id":"37686051800"},{"name":"Maryline Helard","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269770700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224482","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Ice","OFDM modulation","Frequency estimation","Wireless communication","Linear regression","Iterative algorithms","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","iterative methods","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative channel estimation","nonorthogonal schemes","wireless communications","MIMO-OFDM systems","frequency-selective channels","linear regression","multiantenna interference","turbo-channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output OFDM systems receive a great deal of attention due to their great potential in achieving high data rates in wireless communications.

However, layered space-time processing requires the number of receive antennas to be the same or larger than the number of transmit antennas. It is difficult to design a small sized mobile unit with such number of antennas, and hinders the broad dissemination of this promising technology. The authors investigate this problem and present the novel concept of virtual receive antennas for spatial multiplexing system. Each substream is transmitted with a specific timing offset, and the received matched filter output signal is oversampled. The oversampled signals have certain properties such that they can be considered as signals from correlated antennas. Hence, virtual receive antennas are created and the number of physical receive antennas can be reduced. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the system performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.238","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224483.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1262","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Receive Antennas for Spatial Multiplexing System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Receive Antennas for Spatial Multiplexing System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583108","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224483/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Receive Antennas for Spatial Multiplexing System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S49P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048581S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224484,"authors":[{"name":"Akiyo Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sophia University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akiyo","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37698639000"},{"name":"Takeshi Hattori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sophia University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Hattori","id":"37286895000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224484","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"abstract":"Multilink MIMO technique is a promising technology for cellular networks with a guaranteed quality-of-service.

A low-complexity scheme is proposed for joint scheduling and beamforming, which employs feedback in the form of quantized channel directions and lower bounds on each user's received SINR, given a maximum orthogonality factor epsi between transmit beamforming vectors (epsi = 0 if orthogonal beamforming). The authors assume a simple power allocation, which consists of distributing the available power equally over the active beams. In a system with K active users and a given average SNR, the authors show that the sum rate is a function of the number of antennas, the number of active beams (considered less than or equal to the number of antennas), the orthogonality factor epsi and the quantization codebook size. A practical rate function is derived for the described system which approximates the average sum rate accurately as validated through computer simulations. Based on the proposed rate function, optimality of SDMA vs. TDMA systems with asymptotically large number of users is shown. In addition, the authors provide a performance comparison between the proposed algorithm with limited feedback and other approaches with different level of channel state information at the transmitter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balance of Multiuser Diversity and Multiplexing Gain in Near-Orthogonal MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.240","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224485.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Balance of Multiuser Diversity and Multiplexing Gain in Near-Orthogonal MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224485/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583110","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balance of Multiuser Diversity and Multiplexing Gain in Near-Orthogonal MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S49P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05877S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224486,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Musavian","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Musavian","id":"37284625400"},{"name":"Sonia Aissa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Aissa","id":"37273216100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224486","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224486","abstract":"This paper investigates the effects of channel estimation error at the receiver on the achievable rate of distributed space-time block coded transmission.

However, it suffers from error propagation when operated in time-varying channels. In this paper, an adaptive two-stage PIC with the minimum variance (MV) criterion is proposed to solve the problem. Adaptation with the MV criterion is realized with a decision feedback generalized sidelobe canceller (DFGSC). In the first-stage cancellation, a special structure involving dual DFGSCs is developed. All adaptation operations are implemented with the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed two-stage PIC detection can significantly outperform the conventional adaptive PIC detection in fast time-varying channel environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224489.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1294","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Minimum Variance Two-Stage Parallel Interference Cancellation for Time-Varying MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","MIMO","Computational complexity","Time-varying channels","Silicon carbide","Signal detection","Feedback","Least squares approximation","Transmitting antennas","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","signal detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive minimum variance","parallel interference cancellation","time-varying MIMO channels","signal detection","multiple-input multiple-output systems","time-varying channels","decision feedback generalized sidelobe canceller","least-mean-square"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Minimum Variance Two-Stage Parallel Interference Cancellation for Time-Varying MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224489/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583114","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Minimum Variance Two-Stage Parallel Interference Cancellation for Time-Varying MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S50P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067258S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224490,"authors":[{"name":"Jane W.

Instead of relying on complex iterative algorithms, the authors propose a low-complexity, non-iterative but close-to-optimal precoder design solution by relaxing the problem into a simpler convex optimization problem. In this way, a closed-form linear transceiver structure can be derived by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions.

Based on the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, a new design criterion, namely, the good shaping criterion, is introduced. Existing precoding techniques are discussed and an ad-hoc constellation shaping strategy is presented in order to satisfy the proposed criterion. Since maximum-likelihood (ML) detection has the ability to exploit the diversity achieved with the most effective spreading matrices, small size precoders are considered to keep the complexity reasonable. Simulation results have shown that linear precoding recovers most of the frequency diversity loss that is inherent to OFDMA. Moreover it is observed that simple constellation shaping strategies may be effective for small sizes of precoders.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Linear Precoding Techniques for OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.246","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224491.pdf","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Linear Precoding Techniques for OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224491/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583116","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Linear Precoding Techniques for OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S51P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055736S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224492,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37286601400"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"},{"name":"Witold A.

The strategy of the algorithms is to use a correction subcode for error control and a scrambling subcode for PAPR control. The transmitted OFDM sequence is selected with minimum PAPR from a number of candidates which form a coset of scrambling subcode for each codeword of correction subcode. In a BPSK OFDM system, the PAPR reduction is obtained by combining the SLM method with binary cyclic codes. In a 16-QAM OFDM system, the PAPR reduction is achieved by combining the SLM with block coded modulation. The received signal of the modified SLM can be decoded without the need of explicit side information and the proposed scheme achieves good PAPR reduction.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.251","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224496.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Selective Mapping with PAPR Reduction and Error Correction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Selective Mapping with PAPR Reduction and Error Correction in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224496/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583121","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224496/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Selective Mapping with PAPR Reduction and Error Correction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S52P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050072S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224497,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Many PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature each offering a different combination of system performance, complexity and bandwidth efficiency. Selective mapping (SLM) is one of the most promising techniques which has been shown to offer PAPR reductions of several dBs. However, the fact that the SLM technique requires invoking the IFFT process several times per transmitted OFDM-block increases the system complexity and hence results in long latencies and high power consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel post-IFFT PAPR reduction technique combined with a intelligent strategy for generating a unique time-domain sequence per OFDM block that can minimize the PAPR. It will be shown that our proposed technique has much better overall PAPR reduction ability than the ordinary SLM while at the same time requires several order of magnitude less complexity than that of the SLM technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224498.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1343","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Low-Complexity Post-IFFT PAPR Reduction Technique by Utilising Amplitude Transforming for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation","Power engineering and energy","Bandwidth","Transmitters","Constellation diagram","Baseband","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Communications Society","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","time-varying networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post IFFT","PAPR reduction","peak to average power ratio","amplitude transforming","OFDM systems","multicarrier transmission","selective mapping","time domain sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel Low-Complexity Post-IFFT PAPR Reduction Technique by Utilising Amplitude Transforming for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224498/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583123","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Low-Complexity Post-IFFT PAPR Reduction Technique by Utilising Amplitude Transforming for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S52P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061625S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224499,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, OFDM signals have a critical drawback; their peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) is very high compared to that of single-carrier signals. The clipping and filtering method is an effective method to cope with such a problem. However, as the required transmission rate increases with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), clipping distortion becomes dominant and causes burst errors. In this paper, we study a use of Reed-Solomon (RS) code for mitigating the clipping distortion. It is shown that judicious selection of the code parameters can improve the overall system performance. The decoding error rate as well as achievable throughput of the proposed system is calculated based on the combination of theoretical analysis and computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224502.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1366","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Reed-Solomon Codes for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","OFDM","Filtering","Peak to average power ratio","Robustness","Fading","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Distortion","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","filtering theory","OFDM modulation","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","OFDM systems","clipping","filtering","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading","decoding error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Reed-Solomon Codes for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224502/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583127","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Reed-Solomon Codes for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Filtering","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S53P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055575S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224503,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio G.

Numerical examples corroborate the analytical claims and reveal that significant power savings result even with few fed back bits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Power in Wireless OFDMA with Limited-Rate Feedback","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.258","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224503.pdf","startPage":"1367","endPage":"1372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Power in Wireless OFDMA with Limited-Rate Feedback","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224503/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583128","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Power in Wireless OFDMA with Limited-Rate Feedback","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S54P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079242S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224504,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Liu","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Liu","id":"37696831100"},{"name":"Jianchi Zhu","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianchi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37634304800"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Tao","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37288199300"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293664100"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["WTI Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224504","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Scheduling","Fading","Wireless LAN","Digital video broadcasting","Analytical models","Communications Society","Modulation coding","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","scheduling","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA","E-UTRA","uplink","inter cell interference","proportional fairness scheduling","single input and single output"]}],"abstract":"For the Evolved UTRA (EUTRA), in OFDMA uplink, the Inter-cell interference cannot be predicted precisely, so scheduling becomes a puzzling problem and directly affects the uplink performance in OFDMA based system.

In current OFDM system, the sub carrier bandwidth or sub carrier spacing is a fixed design parameter. This is not efficient since the optimum sub carrier bandwidth depends on ICI, which is a function of several parameters such as residual frequency offset, Doppler frequency spread, received signal strength and carrier frequency. Existing algorithms to combat ICI are very complex and sometimes reduce bandwidth efficiency. As an alternative approach, it is worth verifying the benefits of using adaptive bandwidth for sub carrier (ABS). A method for implementing the above scheme is given. Results show that this type of adaptive OFDM scheme has the potential to provide a significant improvement in performance over OFDM systems which use fixed sub carrier bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.260","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224505.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Adaptive Bandwidth for Sub Carriers in OFDM Based Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224505/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Adaptive Bandwidth for Sub Carriers in OFDM Based Wireless Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583130","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224505/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Adaptive Bandwidth for Sub Carriers in OFDM Based Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S54P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045707S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224506,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Tang","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37416991000"},{"name":"Mingqi Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mingqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37291657900"},{"name":"Mosa Ali Abu-Rgheff","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Research, University of Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Mosa Ali","lastName":"Abu-Rgheff","id":"38276207400"},{"name":"Haifeng Wang","affiliation":["Nokia, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280093100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224506","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Bit error rate","Throughput","Peak to average power ratio","Analytical models","Equalizers","Communications Society","Wireless communication","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR analysis","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","single carrier systems","GOFDM","cyclic prefix single carrier","peak to average power ratio","PAPR"]}],"abstract":"GOFDM (generalized OFDM) has been proposed as a tradeoff solution between cyclic prefix single carrier (CP-SC) and OFDM system that can alleviate the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) problem of OFDM.

Under the assumption that channel delay spread is smaller than the guard interval period of an OFDM symbol, the suitably selected inter-symbol interference (ISI) free received signals are exploited through compensating the corresponding linear phases and taking the average in the frequency domain, and in consequence some ICI terms can be automatically cancelled. However, the performance of this self-ICI cancellation scheme is restricted by the inadequate ISI-free region in current OFDM systems. Therefore, a concatenated scheme, which consists of the self-ICI cancellation scheme and a residual ICI reconstruction scheme, is proposed to further improve the BER performance. The simulation results are provided to support that the ICI effect can be significantly removed by the proposed low-complexity concatenated scheme for current high-mobility OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224507.pdf","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1393","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity Concatenated ICI Cancellation Scheme for High-Mobility OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Interference cancellation","Time-varying channels","Delay","Frequency domain analysis","Transmitters","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic prefix","CP","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","inter-carrier interference","ICI","guard interval","GI","inter-symbol interference","ISI","high mobility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Concatenated ICI Cancellation Scheme for High-Mobility OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224507/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583132","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Concatenated ICI Cancellation Scheme for High-Mobility OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S54P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037632S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224508,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuto Yano","affiliation":["Wave Engineering Laboratories, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuto","lastName":"Yano","id":"37402299800"},{"name":"Makoto Taromaru","affiliation":["Wave Engineering Laboratories, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Taromaru","id":"37300843900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224508","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"abstract":"In this paper, a pre-FFT type MMSE adaptive array antenna for an OFDM packet transmission system to suppress asynchronous inter-system interference is proposed.

In the data period, it detects a new arrival of an interference signal by measuring the instantaneous fluctuation of the complex amplitude on each pilot subcarrier, and then regenerates the weight immediately by an iterative process in a few OFDM symbols. The average packet error rate of the proposed receiver is evaluated through computer simulations assuming an indoor line-of-sight environment and the IEEE 802.11a data packet structure.

Recently, we introduced an OFDM-AF schemes that achieves significant SNR gains by reordering groups of received subcarriers (chunks) at the relay station to optimally couple them into the 2n hop channel. This reordering process, however, destroys the correlation between chunks, so channel estimation techniques based on interpolation no longer work. To mitigate this problem, we propose to insert a new pilot grid at the relay station in addition to the existing pilot grid. At the mobile, channel estimation is performed in two steps, where the 2n and 1 hop channels are estimated separately. The proposed pilot and channel estimation scheme allows to fully exploit the gains through chunk reordering at the relay station with only a small increase in complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224509.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1405","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Design for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward with Chunk Reordering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Decoding","Interpolation","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth","Base stations","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","multihop networks","chunk reordering","amplify and forward","OFDM","pilot design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Design for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward with Chunk Reordering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583134","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Design for OFDM Amplify-and-Forward with Chunk Reordering","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S55P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067153S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224510,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Ruan","affiliation":["Research, Australian National University, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37409994800"},{"name":"Mark C.

However, using denser pilot symbols reduces the transmission throughput. In this paper, we propose a pseudo-pilot algorithm for data detection in fast-varying channels without increasing the pilot density. In our algorithm, we select some data symbols among a block of transmitted symbols, and the selected symbols are considered as pseudo-pilot symbols. Then based on a regressional model-based least-square-fitting (LSF) approach, the receiver associates each possible pattern of pseudo-pilots with a data sequence and a corresponding metric. All possible patterns of pseudo-pilots are searched and among which we choose the associated data sequence whose corresponding metric is minimum. The proposed algorithm needs to search all possible patterns of pseudo-pilots, and therefore the complexity may increase with the number of pseudo-pilots and constellation size. To reduce the searching number, we further propose two modified schemes. In the first modified scheme, once the metric is smaller than a threshold, we stop searching other patterns of pseudo-pilots. The second modified scheme further computes a preferable pattern of pseudo-pilots before the searching process. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm could approach a BEP lower bound that is obtained by letting the receiver know the true values of pseudo-pilots. Comparing with the linear interpolation method, the proposed algorithm shows obvious improvement in fast-varying channels. The proposed modified schemes could effectively reduce the searching number while maintain the performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.268","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of OFDM Signals in Fast Fading with Low-Density Pilot Symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of OFDM Signals in Fast Fading with Low-Density Pilot Symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224513/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583138","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of OFDM Signals in Fast Fading with Low-Density Pilot Symbols","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S55P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067725S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224515,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37690102800"},{"name":"Roger S.

Using these SNR thresholds, we derive a frequency spreading adaptive modulation scheme and obtain its performance. For comparison, we derive an algorithm which provides a tight upper bound. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme exhibits more than 5 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gain relative to the constant transmit power adaptive modulation without frequency spreading in the low SNR region. When compared with the multiband UWB system, the proposed algorithm achieves up to at least 7 dB and 4 dB improvements at the high SNR region and the low SNR region respectively.

Motivated by the increasing popularity of OFDM and the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique, how to use the multiuser and the frequency diversity simultaneously to improve the coverage reliability of the diversity-deficient multiplexing system is an essential issue. Because the total available transmit power is split uniformly across transmit antennas in the OFDM-based spatial multiplexing systems, increasing the number of transmit antennas leads to a smaller signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom. Thus we propose the COSA algorithm to enhance the coverage performance of this system.

Layered space time processing in V-BLAST requires the number of receive antennas to be equal to or larger than the number of transmit antennas. However, it is impractical for small-sized mobile units to accommodate all the required antennas. Focusing on this problem, we have presented a novel concept of virtual receive antennas (VRA) for spatial multiplexing system in flat fading channels. In that work, time domain equalization is utilized to eliminate inter-symbol interference, which is generated in the VRA. However, the employed time domain equalizer has a high computational complexity. In this paper, the VRA system with low complexity frequency domain equalizer (FDE) is investigated. Moreover, as the noise in the VRA system is correlated due to oversampling, we also present the noise decorrelating filter design. Through complexity and performance evaluation, FDE is demonstrated to be more suitable for the VRA system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.277","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224522.pdf","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1474","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Receive Antenna System with Frequency Domain Equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Receive Antenna System with Frequency Domain Equalization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583147","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224522/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Receive Antenna System with Frequency Domain Equalization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S57P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074807S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224523,"authors":[{"name":"Young Geon Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Geon","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37544054600"},{"name":"Joon Ho Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276361800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224523","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Equivalence of SC LMMSE-FDE to Continuous-Time LMMSE Equalizer","abstract":"In this paper, it is shown that single-carrier (SC) linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) frequency domain equalizer (FDE) is asymptotically equivalent to continuous-time (CT) LMMSE equalizer in the limit of a very large block length. The equivalence is established in the sense that the mean-squared error (MSE) of the SC LMMSE-FDE converges to that of the CT LMMSE equalizer. First, the asymptotic MSE of the SC LMMSE-FDE is derived. Then, the necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic equivalence is obtained. It is shown that if the received signal is sampled slower than the Nyquist rate then no fixed receive filter followed by a symbol-rate sampler can achieve the MSE of the CT LMMSE equalizer, given an arbitrary channel response. On the contrary, if the received signal is sampled faster than the Nyquist rate then the MSE of the CT LMMSE receiver can be asymptotically achieved by any square-root Nyquist receive filter, of which energy spectral density is flat over transmitted signal's frequency band. Representative numerical results are provided and discussions on convergence rate are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.278","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224523.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Nonlinear filters","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Sufficient conditions","Convergence of numerical methods","Adaptive filters","H infinity control","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","least mean squares methods","Nyquist criterion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic equivalence","continuous-time LMMSE equalizer","single-carrier linear minimum mean-squared error frequency domain equalizer","Nyquist rate","symbol-rate sampler","arbitrary channel response","Nyquist receive filter","energy spectral density"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Equivalence of SC LMMSE-FDE to Continuous-Time LMMSE Equalizer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224523/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224523/","accessionNumber":"9583148","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Equivalence of SC LMMSE-FDE to Continuous-Time LMMSE Equalizer","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S57P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086178S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224524,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, High Technology Center, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311555300"},{"name":"Job Oostveen","affiliation":["TNO Information and Communication Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Job","lastName":"Oostveen","id":"37294715300"},{"name":"Alessio Filippi","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, High Technology Center, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Filippi","id":"37266355300"},{"name":"Stefan Wesemann","affiliation":["Signalion GmbH, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wesemann","id":"37697785900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224524","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless LAN","Telecommunication traffic","Channel estimation","Frequency synchronization","Payloads","Interference","Communications Society","Laboratories","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation","packet radio networks","synchronisation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-based OFDM WLAN","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","IEEE 802.11a/g/n","fixed-length preamble","channel estimation","superimposed preamble","signal structure","variable data rate","receiver processing scheme","time synchronization","frequency synchronization","data detection"]}],"abstract":"In packet-based OFDM WLAN systems (IEEE 802.11a/g/n), each packet has a fixed-length preamble for synchronization and channel estimation purposes.

In this work, we propose a new scheme, called superimposed preamble, to improve the efficiency of 802.11a alike systems.

A flexible iterative turbo decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed and studied numerically, which exhibits good error performance and resilience to fading, requires moderate training and low complexity, and accommodates multiple antennas easily. The scheme performs well without knowledge of the pilots of interfering signals from other cells, which is typically unavailable in practice, while such knowledge may improve the performance significantly. Furthermore, in the absence of knowledge of pilots for the out-of-cell interference, it is found that estimating the filter coefficients of the DFE directly is superior to deriving the coefficients from estimates of the instantaneous channel gains.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224525.pdf","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1490","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Turbo Decision-Feedback Detection for Downlink OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","OFDM","Decision feedback equalizers","Multiuser detection","Iterative decoding","Frequency division multiplexing","Resilience","Fading","Interference","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","decision feedback equalisers","interference (signal)","iterative methods","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo decision-feedback detection","downlink OFDM","multiuser detection","cellular systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","cell boundary","neighboring cell","iterative turbo decision-feedback equalizer","interfering signals","out-of-cell interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Turbo Decision-Feedback Detection for Downlink OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583150","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Turbo Decision-Feedback Detection for Downlink OFDM","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S58P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094375S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224526,"authors":[{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289794700"},{"name":"Young-Jun Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Jun","lastName":"Hong","id":"37402792000"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"},{"name":"Sae-Young Chung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sae-Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37291425800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224526","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency domain analysis","Fading","OFDM","Channel state information","Modulation coding","Communications Society","Computer science","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subband nulling","OFDM-based wireless communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","water-filling","optimal resource allocation","channel state information","enhanced distributed transmission mode"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive sub-band nulling technique in order to improve the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless communication systems.

Multiuser multichannel diversity is investigated to exploit the innate multiplexing gain from fading variation and delay tolerance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224527.pdf","startPage":"1496","endPage":"1501","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Optimal Real-time Video Transmission in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","OFDM","Quality of service","Fading","Bit error rate","Throughput","Delay","Forward error correction","Wireless networks","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","quality of service","video streaming","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasioptimal real-time video transmission","OFDM systems","QoS provisioning","quality of service","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless channels","subcarrier allocation schemes","real-time video streaming","Munkres algorithm","subcarrier assignment","multiuser multichannel diversity","fading variation","delay tolerance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Optimal Real-time Video Transmission in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583152","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Optimal Real-time Video Transmission in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S58P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043374S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224528,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37690743900"},{"name":"Ping Gong","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Gong","id":"37597601100"},{"name":"Shaopeng Feng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaopeng","lastName":"Feng","id":"37287686200"},{"name":"Hanfeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hanfeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293133300"},{"name":"Yonghua Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yonghua","lastName":"Li","id":"37292406800"},{"name":"Weiling Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224528","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a spatial multiplexing and diversity joint transmit structure for MIMO-OFDM system where space-frequency block coding (SFBC) is used over all spatial multiplexing layers to obtain both space diversity and frequency diversity gain.

Given a multiuser time-division (TD) multiplexing system with users' delay constraints, our aim is to minimize the overall transmit power by optimizing the power allocation and the time sharing (i.e., the number of assigned blocks) among the users. The central transmitter (or scheduler) is assumed to have only the channel statistics (CST) while the mobile receivers (or users) have perfect instantaneous channel state information. This problem is of great importance for communication systems where the data rates are preset and the transmission cost is to be minimized. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we derive an analytic equation for the minimum power to support a given rate with an outage probability constraint if the number of assigned blocks for a user is known a priori. On the other hand, by constraining the upper bounds of the outage rate requirements, we show that the optimal time-sharing parameters can be found using convex optimization after relaxation. Our proposed solution hence first finds the time-sharing parameters by proper mapping from the relaxed optimum, and then uses the minimum power equations to obtain the corresponding optimal power distribution.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.285","startPage":"1512","endPage":"1516","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation and Multiuser Scheduling for Delay-Limited Communications Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation and Multiuser Scheduling for Delay-Limited Communications Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224530/","accessionNumber":"9583155","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224530/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation and Multiuser Scheduling for Delay-Limited Communications Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S59P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053657S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224531,"authors":[{"name":"Amoakoh Gyasi-Agyei","affiliation":["Central QLD University, Rockhampton, Australia"],"firstName":"Amoakoh","lastName":"Gyasi-Agyei","id":"38272858800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224531","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224531","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Artificial neural networks","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Constraint optimization","Fading","Throughput","Design optimization","Processor scheduling","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","differential equations","Lyapunov methods","multi-access systems","neural nets","protocols","scheduling","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-constrained cross-layer scheduling","artificial neural networks","protocol interactions","service requirements","Lyapunov stable power-constrained opportunistic scheduler","wireless spectrum","multiflow multiuser wireless systems","constrained scheduling problem","differential equations","Lyapunov function","constrained convex optimization problem","Lyapunov stability theory","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.286","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224531.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"1517","endPage":"1521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Power-Constrained Cross-Layer Scheduling Using Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"Cross-layer scheduling has received an intense attention recently owing to the desire to exploit protocol interactions to design optimum systems that are adaptable to service requirements of network applications.

In this paper, the authors propose a practical packet scheduling algorithm for wireless packet-switched OFDM systems, called buffer-aware and traffic-dependent (BATD) scheduler, which consists of two interactive parts: PHY-layer adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) technology on each subcarrier and MAC-layer opportunistic scheduling. Aiming at decreasing the buffer overflow probability while keeping the system throughput as large as possible, the scheduling decision is made based on the information of not only channel conditions but also buffer status as well as traffic characteristics. In addition, the scheduler is able to guarantee certain fairness among users by introducing the so-called \"history service function\". Simulation results show that under practical constraints of finite buffer space and variable packet length, the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional packet scheduling schemes significantly in terms of packet loss rate due to buffer overflow and the total system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.293","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1554","endPage":"1558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer-Aware and Traffic-Dependent Packet Scheduling in Wireless OFDM Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-Aware and Traffic-Dependent Packet Scheduling in Wireless OFDM Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224538/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583163","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-Aware and Traffic-Dependent Packet Scheduling in Wireless OFDM Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S60P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044984S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224541,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Guvenc","affiliation":["DoCoMo Communications Laboratory USA, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Guvenc","id":"37547369300"},{"name":"Chia-Chin Chong","affiliation":["DoCoMo Communications Laboratory USA, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Chin","lastName":"Chong","id":"37274456100"},{"name":"Fujio Watanabe","affiliation":["DoCoMo Communications Laboratory USA, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fujio","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37299792800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224541","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2450},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Statistics","Testing","Least squares methods","Signal processing","Root mean square","Ultra wideband technology","Random variables","Noise measurement","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","least squares approximations","Monte Carlo methods","multipath channels","personal area networks","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonline-of-sight","NLOS identification","NLOS mitigation","wireless positioning","multipath channel statistics","ultra wideband localization systems","least squares localization","IEEE 802.15.4a","wireless LAN","Monte-Carlo simulations"]}],"abstract":"Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) identification and mitigation carries significant importance in wireless positioning systems.

In particular, the IEEE 802.15.4a ultrawideband channel models are used as examples and the above statistics are found to be well modeled by log-normal random variables.

In this paper, a new modelling method for correlated shadowing with log-normal distribution in UWB multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels is proposed based on the Kronecker model and IEEE 802.15.3a channel model recommendation. Moreover, antenna selection technique with low hardware complexity is proposed for a UWB system with multiple receive or transmit antennas to mitigate its channel shadowing effect. The BER performance for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) UWB system with power based antenna selection is evaluated. Antenna selection technique is shown to be effective in mitigating the correlated shadow fading.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224543.pdf","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1587","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kronecker Modelling for Correlated Shadowing in UWB MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","MIMO","Ultra wideband antennas","Fading","Power system modeling","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Ultra wideband technology","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","log normal distribution","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kronecker model","shadow fading","MIMO channels","ultra wideband channels","multipath channels","IEEE 802.15.3a","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","antenna selection","bit error rate","log-normal distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Kronecker Modelling for Correlated Shadowing in UWB MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224543/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583168","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kronecker Modelling for Correlated Shadowing in UWB MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S62P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084099S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224544,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghua Liang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghua","lastName":"Liang","id":"37417135600"},{"name":"Shihua Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281408500"},{"name":"Shaopeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shaopeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423068500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224544","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"abstract":"In this paper, a multiuser detection (MUD) scheme employing joint adaptive filter and space-time signal processing is discussed and experimentally investigated for direct-sequence (DS) ultra-wideband (UWB) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

The minimum required overhead is shown to depend on the level of fairness required, and the bounds that are derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Resource Allocation in an Uplink OFDMA System","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.319","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224564.pdf","startPage":"1695","endPage":"1699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fair Resource Allocation in an Uplink OFDMA System","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224564/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583189","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Resource Allocation in an Uplink OFDMA System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S66P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047331S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224566,"authors":[{"name":"Maung Sann Maw","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Maung Sann","lastName":"Maw","id":"37697699200"},{"name":"Iwao Sasase","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Iwao","lastName":"Sasase","id":"37268382400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224566","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","OFDM","MIMO","Computer science","Frequency conversion","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Time division multiple access","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation scheme","MIMO-OFDMA system","power allocation criterion","data rate fairness","subchannel allocation","singular value decomposition","SVD","channel matrix","multi-input multi-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems"]}],"abstract":"In the conventional subcarrier and power allocation schemes in multi-input multi-output and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA) systems, only equal fairness among users has been considered, and no scheme for proportional data rate fairness is considered. In this paper, subcarrier and power allocation criterion is proposed to maximize the total throughput under the constraints of total power and proportional data rate fairness among users. In the proposed scheme, subchannel allocation is firstly performed by using singular value decomposition (SVD) of channel matrix under the constraint of users' data throughput requirements, and then adaptive bit and power loading is applied.

Proposed algorithms select user and antenna subsets that maximize total power gain of the equivalent channel through mutual null-space projections of the active user channels. With this approach, algorithms add the best user at a time from the set of users not selected yet to the set of selected users until the desired number of users have been selected. To reduce the complexity further, users whose channel correlation to the signal subspace of the previously selected users is under some specified threshold are grouped at each step of the algorithm such that next user is selected from that group. This avoids the search through all K - i remaining users at the ith step of the algorithm. Two RAS algorithms are proposed, which further enhance the power gain of the equivalent channel by selecting a subset that contributes most towards the sum rate. For SO, user selection accounts for the interference of the previously selected users and maximizes the ratio of the total power of the equivalent channel to the approximate interference power on the desired signal subspace. Proposed algorithms perform close to the previously proposed algorithms with much less complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.325","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224570.pdf","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Antenna Selection and User Scheduling for Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224570/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Antenna Selection and User Scheduling for Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224570/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Antenna Selection and User Scheduling for Orthogonal Space-Division Multiplexing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S67P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054629S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224573,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper presents the optimum adaptive modulation and channel coding (AMC) scheme for simultaneously assigned resource blocks (RBs) for the same user when frequency and time domain channel-dependent scheduling is used in the downlink OFDMA radio access with single-antenna transmission. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that, irrespective of the application of power adaptation to RB-dependent modulation, the improvement in the achievable throughput of the RB-dependent modulation scheme compared to that for the RB-common modulation scheme is slight, i.e., 4 to 5%. In addition, the number of required control signaling bits in the RB-dependent modulation scheme becomes greater than that for the RB-common modulation scheme. Therefore, the authors conclude that the RB-common modulation and channel coding rate scheme is preferred, when multiple RBs of the same coded stream are assigned to one user in the case of single-antenna transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Adaptive Modulation and Channel Coding Scheme for Frequency Domain Channel-Dependent Scheduling in OFDM Based Evolved UTRA Downlink","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.335","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224580.pdf","startPage":"1783","endPage":"1788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Adaptive Modulation and Channel Coding Scheme for Frequency Domain Channel-Dependent Scheduling in OFDM Based Evolved UTRA Downlink","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224580/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583205","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Adaptive Modulation and Channel Coding Scheme for Frequency Domain Channel-Dependent Scheduling in OFDM Based Evolved UTRA Downlink","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S69P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082718S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224582,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"Nageen Himayat","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group,Radio Communication Laboratory/ Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nageen","lastName":"Himayat","id":"37355694700"},{"name":"Shilpa Talwar","affiliation":["Corporate Technology Group,Radio Communication Laboratory/ Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37323366400"},{"name":"J.

More specifically, data rates are expected to exceed those of conventional cellular technologies. The IEEE 802.16e WiMAX standard enables the deployment of metropolitan area networks to mobile terminals in non-line-of-sight radio environments. Current concerns include leveraging high data rates, increasing area coverage, and competing with beyond 3G networks. Based on the IEEE 802.16e wirelessMAN-OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) physical (PHY) layer air-interface, this paper presents a physical layer study of MIMO enabled mobile WiMAX in an urban environment. The radio channels are based on those developed in the European Union IST-WINNER project. Results are given in terms of system throughput and outage probability with and without relays for a range of SISO, MISO and MIMO architectures. Results show that satisfactory performance cannot be achieved in macrocells unless radio relays are used in combination with MIMO-STBC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224586.pdf","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1819","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO and Relay Extensions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","MIMO","Relays","Samarium","Frequency conversion","Physical layer","Throughput","Sun","Diversity methods","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","MIMO communication","mobile communication","telecommunication standards","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","MIMO","relay extensions","mobile WiMAX standard","IEEE 802.16e WiMAX standard","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","radio channels","radio relays","MIMO-STBC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO and Relay Extensions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583211","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Mobile WiMAX with MIMO and Relay Extensions","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S71P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070023S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224588,"authors":[{"name":"Wout Joseph","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wout","lastName":"Joseph","id":"37303160500"},{"name":"Wouter Reynders","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Reynders","id":"37697690500"},{"name":"Jeffrey Debruyne","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Debruyne","id":"37697693700"},{"name":"Luc Martens","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Martens","id":"37299329200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224588","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mathematical model","WiMAX","OFDM","Performance analysis","Forward error correction","Throughput","Physical layer","Transmitters","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","diversity reception","IEEE standards","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel models","MIMO communication","IEEE 802.16","diversity schemes","3500 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of a system based on IEEE 802.16-2004 is analyzed for different conditions.

In this paper, we propose a novel admission control scheme based on power reservation. Foremost, we introduce a joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm for WiMAX system, which achieves high power efficiency by minimizing the overall downlink transmit power and utilizing all available subchannels. Based on this, we propose two power reservation schemes for inter-cell handoff calls and intra-cell handoff calls, respectively.

We propose two novel frame detection algorithms: one is based on the pseudo-periodicity property of the preamble signal in time-domain (TD algorithm), and the other one is based on the Euclidean distance in frequency-domain (FD algorithm). In comparison with the FD algorithm, the TD algorithm is more robust to fading and interference, at the cost of a higher implementation complexity. Therefore, we should choose the suitable one based on different system reliability and complexity requirements. As for the cell ID identification procedure, an adaptive correlation length algorithm (ACL algorithm) is proposed, in which the necessary correlation length can be chosen without prior channel knowledge, and thereby greatly reduces the cell search time. The system simulation results show that the proposed frame detection and cell ID identification algorithms are robust and efficient for OFDMA cellular systems, especially for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.347","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224592.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"1848","endPage":"1853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Cell Search Algorithms for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Study on Cell Search Algorithms for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224592/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583217","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224592/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on Cell Search Algorithms for IEEE 802.16e OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S72P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057883S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224595,"authors":[{"name":"Lihua Wan","affiliation":["School of Telecommunications Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Wan","id":"37689865400"},{"name":"Wenchao Ma","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Group, Lenovo Corporate Research and Development, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenchao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37289072800"},{"name":"Zihua Guo","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Group, Lenovo Corporate Research and Development, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zihua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37271604700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224595","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Physical layer","Resource management","Diversity methods","Channel state information","OFDM","Communications Society","Standards development","Telecommunication standards","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","diversity reception","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","scheduling","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer packet scheduling","subchannel allocation scheme","broadband wireless access system","PHY OFDMA mode","subchannel building methods","diversity permutation","contiguous permutation","IEEE 802.16e OFDMA AMC subchannel","multiuser system","multiservice system","multichannel packet-switched system","scheduling priority","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE 802.16e standard is a rapidly developing technology for broadband wireless access system.

In this paper we propose a joint packet scheduling and subchannel allocation scheme applicable for the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA AMC subchannel. Since it is a multiuser, multi-service and multichannel packet-switched system, we define a distinct scheduling priority for each packet on each subchannel that integrates MAC QoS requirements, service type and PHY channel state information (CSI). Based on these scheduling priorities and specific scheduling mechanism, efficient QoS guaranteed resource allocation is achieved in our scheme. Intensive simulations show that our scheme outperforms throughput-oriented maximum C/I (MCI) and QoS-oriented priority schemes under various conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-layer Packet Scheduling and Subchannel Allocation Scheme in 802.16e OFDMA System","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.350","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224595.pdf","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-layer Packet Scheduling and Subchannel Allocation Scheme in 802.16e OFDMA System","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224595/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583220","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-layer Packet Scheduling and Subchannel Allocation Scheme in 802.16e OFDMA System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S73P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05942S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224596,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In order to improve modelling accuracy, statistical model parameters, which are dependent on the environment, are extended to include spatial and temporal correlation. In outdoor scenarios these parameters are assumed constant over \"large\" areas of several wavelengths hence the name large scale parameters. This paper studies the large scale fading (LSF) and the applicability of bringing this previously used outdoor variable to the indoor case. The impacts of the model of the LSF on the outdoor system-performance have been studied and several relevant models have been proposed for outdoor cases. We present the intra-site autocorrelation as well as the inter-site cross correlation of the LSF for an indoor channel. The results are based on two separate measurement campaigns conducted at KTH, Stockholm and TUI, Ilmenau, using a single mobile station (MS) and multiple base stations (BSs) to investigate such models. We observe that the areas under which the LSF could be assumed constant are, in indoor scenarios, so small that it can be assumed independent from one local area to another. Furthermore, we find results that point towards the existence of inter-site correlation in some specific scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224600.pdf","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1899","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Properties of Large Scale Fading Based on Indoor Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Fading","Base stations","Autocorrelation","Floors","Frequency measurement","Communications Society","Signal processing","Information technology","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","fading channels","indoor radio","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation properties","large scale fading","indoor measurements","statistical channel models","outdoor system-performance","intra-site autocorrelation","inter-site crosscorrelation","indoor channel","mobile station","multiple base stations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Properties of Large Scale Fading Based on Indoor Measurements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224600/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583225","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Properties of Large Scale Fading Based on Indoor Measurements","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S74P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052877S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224601,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Bauch","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Bauch","id":"37266555700"},{"name":"Jorgen Bach Andersen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jorgen Bach","lastName":"Andersen","id":"37280846000"},{"name":"Christian Guthy","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Munich University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Guthy","id":"37294594500"},{"name":"Markus Herdin","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Herdin","id":"37266562100"},{"name":"Jesper Nielsen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37280839400"},{"name":"Josef A.

We report interesting results of a measurement campaign which suggest that significant MIMO gains are possible in an indoor environment even under strong line-of-sight condition as long as the distance of the users from the base station is larger than a reverberation distance which only depends on room surface and material. We show results on the achievable multiuser MIMO data rates for the given scenario compare to theoretical limits and discuss the results in the light of the insights gained from the measurement campaign. We also introduce restrictions on the rate distribution between users, i.e. QoS constraints. It is shown that the theoretical limits can be approximately achieved provided that the users which compete for the spatial resources are carefully chosen.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224601.pdf","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1905","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance in a Large Office Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Gain measurement","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Base stations","Transmitting antennas","Indoor environments","Reverberation","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO channel","large office environment","multiuser MIMO-OFDMA scheme","multiuser diversity","reverberation distance","rate distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance in a Large Office Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224601/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583226","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance in a Large Office Environment","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S74P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088971S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4224603,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The resulting ME covariance is similar to, but distinct from, the Kronecker modelling strategy, warranting a direct comparison of the two techniques. Application of the method to wideband indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) measurements taken at 2.4 GHz indicates a slight improvement in the modelling accuracy of the dominant covariance eigenvalues compared to the Kronecker model. On the other hand, the double-directional joint transmit/receive Bartlett spectra are nearly identical, indicating that the ME technique does not significantly improve modelling of the channel multipath structure. This fact suggests that accurate multipath modelling for MIMO systems may not be possible without detailed joint transmit/receive channel knowledge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Channel Modelling: The Kronecker Model and Maximum Entropy","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.358","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224603.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Channel Modelling: The Kronecker Model and Maximum Entropy","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224603/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583228","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Channel Modelling: The Kronecker Model and Maximum Entropy","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S74P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05341S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224608,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"Nageen Himayat","affiliation":["Radio Communication Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nageen","lastName":"Himayat","id":"37355694700"},{"name":"Shilpa Talwar","affiliation":["Radio Communication Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37323366400"},{"name":"Minnie Ho","affiliation":["Radio Communication Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Minnie","lastName":"Ho","id":"37272565000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224608","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Performance analysis","Working environment noise","Signal to noise ratio","Signal analysis","Matched filters","Filtering","Analytical models","Block codes","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cochannel interference","diversity reception","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","spatial diversity techniques","signal to noise plus interference ratio","interference limited environment","OFDMA system","space time block code schemes"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the effects of co-channel interference on spatial diversity techniques.

Due to the structure of the preamble signal, it is reasonable to take a two-stage approach in which one first estimates and compensates the timing offset and the so-called fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) and then deals with the integral CFO and the preamble index. This paper considers joint detection of integral CFO and preamble index, under the assumption that timing and fractional CFO have been acquired to reasonable accuracy. Based on an optimization formulation, we derive a number of detection methods of different complexity and suboptimality. The methods exploit the quasi-orthogonality among the OFDMA WiMAX preamble sequences as well as the organization of the nonzero subcarriers in the preambles. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224612.pdf","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1964","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Detection of Integral Carrier Frequency Offset and Preamble Index in OFDMA WiMAX Downlink Synchronization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Downlink","Frequency synchronization","Timing","Sampling methods","Oscillators","Frequency estimation","Interference","Fading","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","optimisation","signal detection","synchronisation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral carrier frequency offset","OFDMA WiMAX downlink synchronization","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","WiMAX transmission","carrier frequency synchronization","timing synchronization","preamble index identification","joint detection","optimization formulation","detection methods","preamble sequences","nonzero subcarriers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Detection of Integral Carrier Frequency Offset and Preamble Index in OFDMA WiMAX Downlink Synchronization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583237","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Detection of Integral Carrier Frequency Offset and Preamble Index in OFDMA WiMAX Downlink Synchronization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S76P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048287S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224614,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Attallah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Attallah","id":"37279227900"},{"name":"Wu Yan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Yan","id":"37279327800"},{"name":"J.

In this paper, based on practical considerations, we propose a low complexity blind CFO estimation method. We derive an approximate closed-form solution for the CFO estimate. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves similar performance as the method in Liu and Toreli (1998) with significantly reduced computational complexity. For relatively large CFO values, we show that we could use the iterative algorithm in Wu et al.

In uplink OFDMA transmissions, simultaneous transmitted user signals give rise to multiple phase noise where conventional phase noise correction methods can not be directly applied since they target at single phase noise. To solve this problem, a unified phase noise corrupted uplink OFDMA signal model which can apply to any sub-carrier assignment schemes is derived. According to this model, two algorithms based on least-square and maximum likelihood criteria are proposed respectively. Performance simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for uplink OFDMA systems. Our study also shows that interleaved scheme suffers more ICI than subband based scheme under phase noise environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224615.pdf","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1981","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Common Phase Error Estimation for Uplink OFDMA Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Phase noise","Multiple access interference","Communications Society","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Bandwidth","Stochastic resonance","Educational institutions","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser common phase error estimation","uplink OFDMA communications","intercarrier interference","multiple phase noise","maximum likelihood criteria","Wiener phase noise","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Common Phase Error Estimation for Uplink OFDMA Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224615/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583240","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Common Phase Error Estimation for Uplink OFDMA Communications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S77P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044651S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":4224616,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Henkel","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Forschung, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37413352200"},{"name":"Wolfgang Schroer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Forschung, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Schroer","id":"37689746800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224616","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"Receiver synchronization, in terms of time and frequency, is one of the most important tasks designing an OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplex) receiver for coherent detection. Any LO (local oscillator) misalignment of the receivers analog front-end against the transmitter carrier frequency leads to ICI (inter carrier interference) and degrades the overall SNR. This paper introduces a frequency synchronization approach for an OFDM receiver based on the broadcast standard DRM (digital radio mondiale). Based on the desired synchronization bandwidth the procedure of synchronization is separated into two steps. First a rough offset is estimated and a pre-correction is accomplished. In a second step the remaining offset is estimated. Both algorithms are implemented before the actual FFT in the OFDM receiver and doesn't depend on any timing or robustness mode information. Both methods are based either on frequency pilots (references) or the information of the guard interval (cyclic prefix).","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking

from the power amplifier. The loop delay between these two signals must be controlled precisely so that the convergence of the predistorter should be assured. In this paper a novel two-stage loop delay correction scheme is presented. In the first stage, the integer delay between the input signal and the feedback signal is estimated based on the cross-correlation of them. In the second stage, the fractional delay between these two signals are corrected by a delay lock loop (DLL) circuit, in which a novel timing error detector used as the discriminator is proposed. The proposed loop delay correction scheme is applied to an adaptive digital predistorter in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Simulation results show that the proposed loop delay correction method eliminates the loop delay perfectly, so that nearly optimal power spectral density (PSD) performance is achieved and a high degree of linearization is realized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224617/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583242","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Loop Delay Correction for Adaptive Digital Linearization of Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop Delay Correction for Adaptive Digital Linearization of Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S77P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042795S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4224618,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Cottatellucci","affiliation":["University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Cottatellucci","id":"38491386700"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Institut Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Ralf R.

In this paper we focus on the time and frequency dimensions and propose a metric that can be used to quantify diversity. We use the proposed diversity metric to design highly diverse data subchannels and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through simulations. With the use of this diversity metric one can more easily design OFDMA channels because of the reduced computational time required to compare layouts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantifying the Diversity of OFDMA Subchannels","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.374","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224619.pdf","startPage":"1996","endPage":"2000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quantifying the Diversity of OFDMA Subchannels","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224619/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583244","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantifying the Diversity of OFDMA Subchannels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S78P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05165S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224622,"authors":[{"name":"Le Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku Sendai, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293122100"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku Sendai, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224622","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Signal to noise ratio","Filters","Power control","Power engineering and energy","Multiple access interference","Transmitters","Multiuser detection","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink site selection transmit diversity","power allocation","2D block spread DS-CDMA cellular system","direct sequence-code division multiple access","multi-access interference","frequency-selective fading channel","site selection diversity transmission"]}],"abstract":"2D block spread direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) allows multi-rate/multi-connection without causing downlink multi-access interference (MAI) in the presence of a frequency-selective fading channel.

Likewise, contemporary bandwidth requirements of each user in the network rise significantly, being a mixture of traffic types such as Web surfing, file transfer protocol (FTP), video, video-teleconference, and voice. Multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) techniques are recognized as methods that can meet these requirements, since they significantly increase the capacity of wireless networks, without additional bandwidth or transmission power. With a MIMO physical layer (PHY), the transmission channel gets a layered structure. Consequently, support from higher layers with a cross-layer approach that provides efficient management of the channel's spatial layers, can significantly increase the network's performance on both link and system level. In this paper a high capacity medium access control (MAC) protocol for MIMO support is presented. The proposed protocol is based on IEEE 802.11 standard, and provides a flexible and scalable support for multiple antenna terminals, backwards compatible with legacy stations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MAC Protocol for MIMO Based IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.399","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224644.pdf","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A MAC Protocol for MIMO Based IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224644/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583269","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MAC Protocol for MIMO Based IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S83P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046938S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224650,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Chung Ng","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Ping Chung","lastName":"Ng","id":"37279921500"},{"name":"David J.

To improve data reliability, automatic request (ARQ) is used for retransmission of erroneous packets from the radio link level queue. The proposed power allocation scheme is designed to minimize the cost which is defined as a function of transmit power and packet dropping probability at the radio link level queue. The genetic algorithm is used to obtain the solutions for the optimal parameters of the queue-aware power allocation scheme to minimize radio resource usage while meeting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for data traffic.

The numerical results obtained from our exact BER expression are verified by our simulation results and are also compared to those of the Gaussian approximation (GA).","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.414","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224659.pdf","startPage":"2216","endPage":"2220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact BER of Rectangular-Constellation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Subjected to Asynchronous Co-Channel Interference and Nakagami-m Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224659/","displayDocTitle":"Exact BER of Rectangular-Constellation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Subjected to Asynchronous Co-Channel Interference and Nakagami-m Fading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583284","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224659/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact BER of Rectangular-Constellation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Subjected to Asynchronous Co-Channel Interference and Nakagami-m Fading","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S85P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068946S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224664,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed B.

Here we investigate the combination of decision feedback equalizers (DFE's) with Alamouti space-time block codes (STBQ) in time-varying wideband channels. Most prior work considers the use of STBC in flat-fading channels. However, for many mobile applications, time and frequency selectivity in the wireless channel must be included in the analysis. As a result of delay spread and terminal mobility, the transmitted data stream can suffer from severe time varying inter symbol interference (ISI) which requires a form of channel equalization. For a quasi-static environment Alamouti's linear combining scheme provides a reliable and low complexity MIMO solution when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. In this paper we address the mitigation of wideband channels effects on Alamouti STBC codes. The study considers the minimum mean square error (MMSE) performance as a function of channel estimation error for maximum likelihood (ML) and DFE equalizers.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224664.pdf","startPage":"2241","endPage":"2246","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.419","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.419","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224664","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Decision feedback equalizers","Block codes","Wideband","Fading","MIMO","Maximum likelihood estimation","Diversity reception","Frequency","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","block codes","channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time block codes","intersymbol interference","delay spread","multipath fading","adaptive equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224664/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on the Performance of DFE Equalizers with Space Time Block Codes in Wideband Fading Channels","accessionNumber":"9583289","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224664/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on the Performance of DFE Equalizers with Space Time Block Codes in Wideband Fading Channels","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S85P15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049947S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4224669,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Sang Wu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279270400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224669","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"abstract":"We present a new soft handoff scheme in forward link code division multiple access cellular systems, wherein each base station participating in soft handoff sends only a subset of the main data stream (called sub-stream) and the mobile receiver reassembles the sub-streams and restores the main data stream. This approach can reduce the data transmission rate per base station by a factor of the number of participating base stations at the cost of sacrificing the spatial (macro) diversity that is available in conventional soft handoff system. The key to the proposed technique is to increase the signal distance or the processing gain rather than to obtain additional diversity from multiple base stations on top of multi-path diversity that provides diminishing gain. Power gain and the resulting coverage extension over conventional soft handoff system is analyzed as a function of the number of participating base stations and relative signal strengths from different base stations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Multiaccess communication","Signal processing","Bit error rate","Ultra wideband technology","Data communication","Signal analysis","Communications Society","Data engineering","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","error statistics","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft handoff","spatial multiplexing","CDMA cellular","coverage extension","coded BER analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.424","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224669.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-Multiplexed Soft Handoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-Multiplexed Soft Handoff","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224669/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224669/","accessionNumber":"9583294","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-Multiplexed Soft Handoff","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S86P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053019S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224670,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Kimura","affiliation":["Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan","Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryota","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37269075500"},{"name":"Shigeru Shimamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Shimamoto","id":"37281343200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224670","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Filter bank","OFDM","Analog circuits","Bit error rate","Dynamic range","Wireless communication","Resource management","Computer simulation","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division duplex","OFDD system","analog filter bank","multi carrier based duplexing","flexible radio resource management","analog circuit designs","signal dynamic range problem","sub carrier configuration","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed a multi-carrier based duplexing, or orthogonal frequency division duplex (OFDD), that realizes the flexible radio resource management.

The aim of the analog filter bank is moderating the difficulty of analog circuit designs and solving the signal dynamic range problem in the OFDD. The OFDD system approaches a practical one with the help of the analog filter bank. In this paper, we investigate the sub-carrier configuration for OFDD and evaluate the effect of the analog filter bank. Then, we evaluate the bit error rate performance of the OFDD using the analog filter bank in the presence of carrier frequency offset by computer simulations. From the results, we observe that four null sub-carriers are sufficient for a given analog filter bank to avoid the nonlinear degradation at the analog circuit. We also observe that the OFDD system almost achieves the ideal bit error rate performance when the normalized carrier frequency offset is 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.425","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224670.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"2275","endPage":"2280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Orthogonal Frequency Division Duplex (OFDD) System Using an Analog Filter Bank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Orthogonal Frequency Division Duplex (OFDD) System Using an Analog Filter Bank","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224670/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583295","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224670/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Orthogonal Frequency Division Duplex (OFDD) System Using an Analog Filter Bank","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S86P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086077S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224694,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Theoretical analysis is first derived and practical algorithm is proposed based on the analytical results. The algorithm employs a modified auto-covariance of received signal power to estimate the speed of mobiles. The algorithm is based on the received signals which contain unknown transmitted data, unknown frequency selective multipaths possibly including line-of-sight (LOS) component, and random receiver noise. The algorithm works well for frequency selective Rayleigh and Rician channels. The algorithm is very resistant to noise, it provides accurate speed estimation even if the signal-to-noise (SNR) is as low as 0dB. Simulation results indicate that the new algorithm is very reliable and effective to estimation mobile speed corresponding maximum Doppler up to 500Hz. The algorithm has high computational efficiency and low estimation latency, with results being available within one second after communication is established.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224696.pdf","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2425","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.451","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.451","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Wireless communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency","Fading","Intersymbol interference","Rician channels","Signal to noise ratio","Computational modeling","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mobile radio","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile speed estimation","broadband wireless communications","fading channel taps","intersymbol interference","received signal power","frequency selective multipaths","line-of-sight component","random receiver noise","frequency selective Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224696/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Speed Estimation for Broadband Wireless Communications","accessionNumber":"9583321","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224696/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Speed Estimation for Broadband Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S88P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075782S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224698,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunkee Min","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunkee","lastName":"Min","id":"37395615600"},{"name":"Jihyung Kim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jihyung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311399600"},{"name":"Sungeun Lee","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungeun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407202900"},{"name":"Kyungchul Kwak","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungchul","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37406622100"},{"name":"Keuk-Joon Bang","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Keuk-Joon","lastName":"Bang","id":"37365431500"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224698","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Phase estimation","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Multiple access interference","Band pass filters","Degradation","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency response","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing offset estimation algorithm","phase difference","adjacent subcarriers","interleaved OFDMA uplink systems","timing estimator","interleaved orthogonal frequency-division multiple access uplink systems","channel frequency responses","timing offset information","frequency domain","mean square error","channel impulse response","channel length"]}],"abstract":"A new timing estimator using phase difference between adjacent subcarriers is proposed for interleaved orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems.

The proposed approach is non-data-aided and uses only the second order statistics (SOS) of the received signal. In the first stage, determinant of a matrix which is a function of the CFO is used as a cost function. A linear search is performed and the search point which minimizes the determinant value is taken as the estimated CFO. This is called coarse synchronization. In the second stage, adaptive LMS algorithm is used to estimate the CFO. The LMS algorithm is initialized with the estimated CFO from the first stage. The application of the gradient type algorithm is due to the local convexity of the cost function. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated through computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224700.pdf","startPage":"2441","endPage":"2445","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Frequency Synchronization for Uplink MC-CDMA System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Cost function","Least squares approximation","Base stations","OFDM","Downlink","Frequency estimation","Computer simulation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","frequency estimation","higher order statistics","least mean squares methods","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage frequency synchronization","uplink MC-CDMA system","carrier frequency offset estimator","second order statistics","matrix determinant","linear search","search point","coarse synchronization","adaptive LMS algorithm","gradient type algorithm","code division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Frequency Synchronization for Uplink MC-CDMA System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583325","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Frequency Synchronization for Uplink MC-CDMA System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T1S88P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062438S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224701,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Shi","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communication and Signal Processing Research, ECE Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Shi","id":"38270545000"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communication and Signal Processing Research, ECE Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"},{"name":"Seokhyun Yoon","affiliation":["ECE Department, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokhyun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37279393500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224701","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Timing","Estimation error","Autocorrelation","Signal processing","Robustness","AWGN channels","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","estimation theory","OFDM modulation","sequences","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame synchronization","permuted sequences combination","sync words","timing estimation error","constant amplitude zero autocorrelation sequence","sliding window processing","symmetric correlation method","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","frequency offset","AWGN channel","multipath environments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224701","abstract":"A novel \"permuted sequences combination\" method is proposed in this paper, which uses the conventional frame structure wherein two sync words, each comprising M complex symbols, are appended at the frame start.

Essentially, the first sync word, stilde\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, is a predetermined constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence.

As a special case of permuted sequences combination method, symmetric correlation method is robust to the frequency offset.

In this paper, the filters used to track the channel are restricted to have a recursive structure, based on the previous estimate and new observation.

We increase the reliability of our power control scheme by using linguistic knowledge of transmit power control (TPC) obtained from a group of network experts rather than a single expert.

The subcarrier allocation algorithm is based on routing information and a novel definition of interference sets and it aims at providing fair transmission rate among traffic flows in an end-to-end basis. The joint rate and power control is treated as a network utility maximization problem considering interference of simultaneous transmissions on the same subcarrier with node power constraint.

This paper derives the position error bound (PEB), a fundamental limit for localization accuracy, by using information inequality. In particular, the authors consider all multipath propagation parameters, and hence our bound is tighter than those of previous work. To alleviate computation complexity, the authors put forth the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to characterize the localization accuracy. This approach also unifies the contributions from line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and a priori knowledge to the PEB in a consistent form. These results are applicable to ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) systems as a specific case.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.564","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224809.pdf","startPage":"3046","endPage":"3051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization Accuracy via Fisher Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224809/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization Accuracy via Fisher Information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583433","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224809/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization Accuracy via Fisher Information","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S06P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057557S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224814,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Qian","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qian","id":"37692626100"},{"name":"Bin Fan","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Fan","id":"37624671300"},{"name":"Kan Zheng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276693000"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224814","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Interference","Multiaccess communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Probability","Linear systems","Equations","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","complex networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiservice access capacity analysis","TDD-CDMA system","Delbrouck's algorithm","multiservice time division duplex-code division multiple access","soft blocking probability","call blocking rate","service time distribution","multidimensional Erlang-B formula","complex linear system","network dimensioning","network optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper represents a method based on generalizing Delbrouck's algorithm for calculating the access capacities of multi-service time division duplex-code division multiple access (TDD-CDMA) networks. The method models the system as a multi-service model with state dependent soft blocking probabilities, and it uses the soft capacity limit caused by TDD-CDMA system in calculating the call blocking rate of multi-services. The traffic models used in this method are insensitive to the service time distribution and thus the method is very robust for applications. So it is more accurate than multi-dimensional Erlang-B formula, which does not consider the soft capacity, and it is also simpler than resolving the complex linear system equations with soft capacity. The paper provides both analytical results and simulation results to support the method, and these results match. Thus the proposed method can be used in TDD-CDMA network dimensioning and optimizing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Service Access Capacities Analysis of TDDCDMA System with Soft Blocking","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.569","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224814.pdf","startPage":"3076","endPage":"3081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Service Access Capacities Analysis of TDDCDMA System with Soft Blocking","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224814/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583438","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Service Access Capacities Analysis of TDDCDMA System with Soft Blocking","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S07P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075582S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224818,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["Network Technology Research Centre, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277306500"},{"name":"Peter H.

Any MS can be allocated to any TS for either uplink or downlink transmission. The time slot allocation scheme within these 15 TSs gives the system the freedom of adapting the channel environment. In this paper, we propose and study multihop dynamic time slot allocation schemes, namely dynamic switching point with multihop (DSPM) and maximum interference first (MIF), for TDD-CDMA system. Compared to slot allocation schemes without multihop technique, it is shown that our proposed schemes can improve both the data rate for single user and the overall throughput for the whole system. In addition, we also study the distribution of data transmission speed to demonstrate the effectiveness of each slot allocation scheme clearly.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.573","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3099","endPage":"3104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Slot Allocation Schemes for Multihop TDD-CDMA Cellular System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time Slot Allocation Schemes for Multihop TDD-CDMA Cellular System","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224818/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583442","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224818/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Slot Allocation Schemes for Multihop TDD-CDMA Cellular System","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S07P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069394S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224829,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Yao","id":"37280659600"},{"name":"Chen-Khong Tham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen-Khong","lastName":"Tham","id":"37302074200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224829","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Learning","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Power system modeling","Communications Society","Decision making","Next generation networking","Degradation","Measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","distributed decision making","learning (artificial intelligence)","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed reinforcement learning","forward link soft handoff","cellular CDMA systems","dynamic power control scheme","coordinated decision-making method","optimal transmission power levels"]}],"abstract":"Power control for forward link soft handoff users in cellular CDMA systems is important in order to obtain good forward link performance. The two existing schemes in the 3GPP specification, balancing power control (BPC) and site selection diversity transmission (SSDT), both have shortcomings due to their static properties. In this paper, we propose a dynamic power control scheme which can modify the power control policy according to changing environment situations. We apply a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL)-based coordinated decision-making method to achieve dynamic power control. The main idea is to learn the optimal transmission power levels from BSs under different environmental situations with multiple mobile users. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively combines the advantages of existing schemes in order to maximize the forward link capacity.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.584","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224829.pdf","startPage":"3164","endPage":"3169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control using Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Forward Link Soft Handoff in Cellular CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224829/","displayDocTitle":"Power Control using Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Forward Link Soft Handoff in Cellular CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583453","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224829/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control using Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Forward Link Soft Handoff in Cellular CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S09P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053102S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224831,"authors":[{"name":"Carmen Rodriguez-Estrello","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, CINVESTAV, Mexicali, Mexico"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Rodriguez-Estrello","id":"38272908600"},{"name":"Felipe A.

The analysis takes into account call connection types (i.e., soft handoff or single base station) and their respective link reliabilities, which according to some measurements in real cellular networks reported in the literature can adequately be modeled by considering a Poisson call interruption process. This is turn results in significant simplifications of system level analysis. Then, with the proposed interruption modeling, an elegant teletraffic analysis for the performance evaluation of mobile cellular CDMA networks considering both wireless link unreliability and resource insufficiency is developed. Realistic mobility conditions are taken into account by characterizing users' mobility parameters by means of a smooth random mobility model. Novel mathematical expressions for the new call blocking, handoff failure, and forced termination probabilities are then derived. Graph theory and Mason's rule are employed for the derivation of the forced termination probability.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.586","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224831.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3176","endPage":"3181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Level Model for Wireless Channel Unreliability in CDMA Mobile Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System Level Model for Wireless Channel Unreliability in CDMA Mobile Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224831/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583455","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224831/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Level Model for Wireless Channel Unreliability in CDMA Mobile Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S10P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062028S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224848,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Zhan-jun","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Zhan-jun","id":"38274212900"},{"name":"Pan Wen","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Wen","id":"38276112800"},{"name":"Yu Xiao-hu","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Xiao-hu","id":"38276593500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224848","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Macrocell networks","Microcell networks","Interference","Hierarchical systems","Power control","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Control systems","Diversity reception","Optical fiber cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA hierarchical cellular system","DAS embedment","code division multiple access","cellular network structure","underlaid distributed antenna system","overlaid macrocells","network control","site engineering","remote access unit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a two-layer code division multiple access (CDMA) hierarchical cellular network structure is presented, which made up underlaid distributed antenna system (DAS) and overlaid macrocells.

Network selection and QoS support for different services are two of the major challenges in integrated CDMA cellular/WLAN networks. In this paper, a net utility-based network selection scheme was proposed, which takes into account the network resource, QoS requirements of applications, user mobility, and vertical handoff. The goal of the proposed scheme is to guide users to select the most suitable access network, where the users' QoS requirements can be satisfied and the cost that user paid for is the lowest. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network selection scheme in integrated CDMA cellular/WLAN networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Net Utility-Based Network Selection Scheme in CDMA Cellular/WLAN Integrated Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.610","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224855.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Net Utility-Based Network Selection Scheme in CDMA Cellular/WLAN Integrated Networks","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224855/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583479","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Net Utility-Based Network Selection Scheme in CDMA Cellular/WLAN Integrated Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S15P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11676S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224857,"authors":[{"name":"Kari Aho","affiliation":["University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Kari","lastName":"Aho","id":"37294202200"},{"name":"Tapani Ristaniemi","affiliation":["University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Tapani","lastName":"Ristaniemi","id":"37282833000"},{"name":"Janne Kurjenniemi","affiliation":["Magister Solutions Limited, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Kurjenniemi","id":"37294203000"},{"name":"Ville Haikola","affiliation":["Nokia, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Haikola","id":"37268942400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224857","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia systems","Multimedia communication","Diversity reception","Delay","Fading","Communications Society","Cultural differences","Multiaccess communication","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","multicast communication","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia broadcast multicast service","macro diversity","WCDMA networks","soft combining","selective combining","3GPP release 6","dynamic system level tool","point-to-multipoint mode"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Level Performance of Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) with Macro Diversity","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","endPage":"3329","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.612","startPage":"3325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224857","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to evaluate the system level performance of multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) in WCDMA networks. To enhance coverage and data rates of MBMS users, two macro diversity concepts were introduced in 3GPP release 6: soft and selective combining. Prior work on the evaluation of MBMS with macro diversity schemes has been restricted to link level studies or to very limited scenarios in system level studies. This paper examines the concepts in more detail with dynamic system level tool in which e.g. mobility of users and interactions of the radio resource management functionalities are explicitly taken into account. The evaluation of combining set size and data rates with different thresholds and delays in the combining procedures are especially emphasized. Considering point-to-multipoint (p-t-m) mode of MBMS, the studies indicated clear performance improvements to be gained with macro diversity. In addition, the impact of delays in combining set update procedures was observed to be rather small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9583481","htmlLink":"/document/4224857/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"System Level Performance of Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) with Macro Diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Level Performance of Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) with Macro Diversity","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S16P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043392S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4224866,"authors":[{"name":"Soochang Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soochang","lastName":"Park","id":"37293203000"},{"name":"Donghun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Donghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292969900"},{"name":"Euisin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Euisin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37290908000"},{"name":"Fucai Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Fucai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37291835800"},{"name":"Younghwan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younghwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37290815400"},{"name":"Sang-Ha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Ha","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279284100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224866","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Network topology","Peer to peer computing","Communication channels","Computer architecture","Temperature sensors","Communications Society","Computer networks","Wireless communication","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication architecture","user mobility issue","wireless sensor fields","infrastructureless sensor field","dynamic sink model","average delay","delivery ratio","network lifetime"]}],"abstract":"Typical sensor networks consist of users, sinks, and a number of sensor nodes. The traditional architecture usually assumes that there is a legacy network between users and sinks. However, practical users like firefighters and soldiers move around sensor fields and they might not have any direct communication through legacy networks. In other words, sensor networks are the only communication channel between users and sinks in practical sensor fields. Now there are no researches with respect to architecture to support the user mobility. Thus it is necessary to deliberate a new architecture for such the issue. In this paper, a novel communication architecture was presented where a user operates around an infrastructureless sensor field. A new networking model was then proposed, named dynamic sink model, to support user mobility on the novel architecture. In the model a sink is temporarily selected among generic sensor nodes by a user when the user wants to get information from a sensor network. The chosen sink gathers data from sensor nodes for interested tasks and propagates collected information to the user via the sensor network. The performance of the dynamic sink model on the novel architecture was evaluated and explored with regard to average delay, delivery ratio, and network lifetime compared with the common static sink network model on typical communication architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Communication Architecture to Reflect User Mobility Issue in Wireless Sensor Fields","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.621","startPage":"3376","endPage":"3381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224866.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Communication Architecture to Reflect User Mobility Issue in Wireless Sensor Fields","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224866/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583490","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Communication Architecture to Reflect User Mobility Issue in Wireless Sensor Fields","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S18P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067948S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224871,"authors":[{"name":"Ca Van Phan","affiliation":["Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Ca Van","lastName":"Phan","id":"38184688100"},{"name":"Jeong Geun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong Geun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539890300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224871","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Wireless sensor networks","Fading","Proposals","Throughput","Intelligent sensors","Peer to peer computing","Access protocols","Media Access Protocol","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","binary decision diagrams","fading channels","Markov processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient transmission strategy","wireless sensor networks","transmission algorithm","binary-decision based transmission","channel-aware backoff adjustment","channel quality","Markov decision process","transmission priority","fading wireless channels","network lifetime"]}],"abstract":"In this work we propose an energy-efficient transmission strategy for wireless sensor networks that operate in a strict energy-constrained environment. Our transmission algorithm consists of two components: a binary-decision based transmission and a channel-aware backoff adjustment. In the binary-decision based transmission, decision on whether to transmit or not is absolutely dependent on the current channel conditions. Specifically, transmission is initiated only when the channel quality exceeds a specified threshold, so that unsuccessful transmissions causing a waste of energy are avoided whenever possible. Using the Markov decision process (MDP) formulation we obtain the optimum threshold for successful transmission. A channel-aware backoff adjustment, the second component of our proposal, is introduced to favor sensor nodes seeing better channel in terms of transmission priority. By intelligently combining these two ingredients our transmission algorithm attempts to maximize energy efficiency. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the performance of our proposal over fading wireless channels. Numerical results show that our transmission algorithm outperforms the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency, thereby further prolonging the network lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.626","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224871.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.626","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"3406","endPage":"3411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Transmission Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Transmission Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224871/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224871/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583495","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Transmission Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S18P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077885S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4224876,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Marc Kelif","affiliation":["France Telecom Research and Development Center, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Kelif","id":"37391908400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224876","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"abstract":"We develop an analytical approach of omni-directional and sectored CDMA systems, adapted to each given zone of the network: we establish explicit expressions of the interference factors, which represent a characteristic of these networks.

Mesh routers are equipped with multiple radio transceivers that can work simultaneously. This MIMO feature greatly improves data throughput of mesh routers. A critical issue in MIMO mesh networks is to maintain network coverage and routing for a long lifetime with high energy efficiency. As more and more outdoor applications require long-lasting, high energy efficient and continuously-working mesh networks with battery-powered mesh routers, it is important to maximize the performance of mesh networks from a battery aware point of view. Recent study in battery technology reveals that discharging of a battery is nonlinear. Batteries tend to discharge more power than needed, and reimburse the over-discharged power later if they have sufficiently long recovery time. To take advantage of the battery recovery property, in this paper we first study the relationships between various MIMO transceiver parameters and their battery parameters to give an energy model for MIMO transceivers. We then present a multiple current battery model that can accurately describe battery behaviors with multiple current inputs. Based on these two models, we propose a battery aware MIMO mesh network power scheduling scheme. The scheme consists of two algorithms: the coverage algorithm and the backhaul routing algorithm. The key idea of the coverage algorithm is to let neighboring mesh routers collaboratively adjust their transceiver radii to dynamically recover their over-discharged battery power. The backhaul routing algorithm adopts the multiple current battery model to calculate battery discharging loss at routers for scheduling mesh backhaul routing. We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that network lifetime can be improved by up to 10.3% and 16.1% for homogeneous and heterogeneous mesh networks, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Energy efficiency","Routing","MIMO","Mesh networks","IP networks","Radio transceivers","Throughput","Collaboration","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","MIMO communication","telecommunication network routing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery aware scheme","mesh backhaul routing","battery discharging loss","mesh routers","backhaul routing algorithm","coverage algorithm","power scheduling scheme","multiple current battery model","battery parameters","MIMO transceiver parameters","multiple input multiple output mesh networks","wireless MIMO mesh networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.660","startPage":"3603","endPage":"3608","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224905.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Battery Aware Scheme for Energy Efficient Coverage and Routing in Wireless MIMO Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Battery Aware Scheme for Energy Efficient Coverage and Routing in Wireless MIMO Mesh Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9583529","publicationDate":"March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224905/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Battery Aware Scheme for Energy Efficient Coverage and Routing in Wireless MIMO Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S26P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079948S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4224921,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Seyfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Seyfi","id":"37699192600"},{"name":"Farid Ashtiani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Ashtiani","id":"37542222100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224921","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Traffic control","Capacity planning","Gain","Multiaccess communication","Queueing analysis","Steady-state","Interference","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","probability","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leaky bucket","data traffic shaping","capacity enhancement","VSG","CDMA","cellular networks","variable spreading gain","code division multiple access","closed Jackson queueing network","steady state probability","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose data traffic shaping via leaky bucket in order to reduce outage probability and enhance capacity of voice users for uplink variable spreading gain code-division multiple-access (VSG-CDMA) cellular networks.

We intend to see which protocol is more effective in coping with a long GEO-satellite link delay, especially when hybridized with a high bit-error-rate (BER), and which one has throughput performance advantage over another. Based on the analysis of the experimental results, we found that the rate-based SCPS-pure rate control outperforms CFDP and standard TCP with a much higher throughput, and the throughput advantage becomes more pronounced when the channel rates are asymmetric. Quantitatively, SCPS-pure rate control has a performance advantage around 6600 bytes/sec over symmetric channel and around 8500 bytes/sec over asymmetric channel in comparison to CFDP-TCP and Linux-TCP.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3714","endPage":"3718","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224925.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Rate-Based and Delay-Tolerant Transmission Mechanisms over GEO-Satellite Communication Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224925/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Rate-Based and Delay-Tolerant Transmission Mechanisms over GEO-Satellite Communication Links","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583549","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of Rate-Based and Delay-Tolerant Transmission Mechanisms over GEO-Satellite Communication Links","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S30P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051025S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224928,"authors":[{"name":"Na Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Yao","id":"37541315200"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224928","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"Managing congestion is essential to maximise carried traffic in a mobile network and in this paper a technique is presented that uses learning to cooperatively change antenna patterns across a cluster of cells, so minimising blocking.

In this paper, we propose a distributed uplink call admission control and network selection scheme for hybrid CDMA-OFDMA networks, which aims to efficiently utilize the overall radio resource of the HWN, on condition that the incoming call blocking probability and the ongoing call dropping probability are both within the acceptable ranges. When a new call arrives, based on the information obtained from the resource management modules of the two radio access networks (RANs), the process of network load estimation can be implemented in the corresponding mobile terminal (MT) through power estimation: 1) estimation of the required transmit power from the MT if it is admitted to either RAN; 2) estimation of the total uplink power consumptions in the two RANs after admitting the incoming call. Accordingly, CAC decisions can be made distributedly in the MT by comparing the total uplink power consumptions with the predetermined uplink power thresholds of the corresponding RANs. If the incoming call can be admitted by both RANs, the estimated terminal transmit powers in the two RANs are compared, and the RAN requiring less transmit power from the MT is selected as the target network. Simulation results indicate that our scheme is practical and effective in achieving high resource utilization with low probability of overload.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.691","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3774","endPage":"3779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Call Admission Control and Network Selection Scheme for Hybrid CDMA-OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Call Admission Control and Network Selection Scheme for Hybrid CDMA-OFDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224936/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583560","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224936/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Call Admission Control and Network Selection Scheme for Hybrid CDMA-OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S32P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050159S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224942,"authors":[{"name":"Farooq Bari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Farooq","lastName":"Bari","id":"37297175300"},{"name":"Victor Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279114300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224942","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":476},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224942","abstract":"Inter-working of existing packet switched wireless access technologies can help make services ubiquitously available. However this means that the services will have to be delivered over a heterogeneous mix of access technologies. There are several technical challenges that have to be overcome in such an environment, with selection of an optimal service delivery network being one of the most important issues. Choosing a nonoptimal network can result in problems such as the use of expensive access types or poor service experience. Multi attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms have been considered in the past to rank the candidate networks in a preference order. While many types of MADM algorithms exist, the decision maker may choose to use a particular type of algorithm to solve a decision problem based on an assessment of the suitability of the algorithm to the problem space. This paper adapts ELECTRE, a type of MADM algorithm that performs pair-wise comparisons amongst the alternatives, to solve the problem of network selection. The algorithm has been modified so that it is able to provide complete ranking of networks even in scenarios where the utility of some attributes is nonmonotonic. The algorithm has been evaluated by applying it to a network selection scenario in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3810","endPage":"3815","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224942.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of ELECTRE to Network Selection in A Hetereogeneous Wireless Network Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Packet switching","Space technology","Decision making","Roaming","Costs","Availability","Wireless LAN","3G mobile communication","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","packet switching","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ELECTRE","network selection","heterogeneous wireless network environment","packet switched wireless access technologies","optimal service delivery network","multiattribute decision making algorithms","decision maker"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of ELECTRE to Network Selection in A Hetereogeneous Wireless Network Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224942/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224942/","accessionNumber":"9583566","publicationDate":"March 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of ELECTRE to Network Selection in A Hetereogeneous Wireless Network Environment","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S34P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047437S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4224944,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Ekram Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MAN, Canada"],"firstName":"Ekram","lastName":"Hossain","id":"38514511000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224944","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Microeconomics","Radio transmitters","Pricing","Environmental economics","Iterative algorithms","Stability analysis","Wireless communication","Communications Society","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical spectrum sharing","cognitive radio environment","unlicensed service","interrelated market model","multiple-level market","shared spectrum size","charging price","iterative algorithms","stability condition","learning rate","demand and supply functions","local stability analysis","successive overrelaxation method"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of hierarchical spectrum sharing in cognitive radio environment. In the system model under consideration, licensed service (i.e., primary service) can share/sell available spectrum to an unlicensed service (i.e., secondary service), and again, this unlicensed service can share/sell allocated spectrum to other service (i.e., tertiary service). We formulate the problem of hierarchical spectrum sharing as an interrelated market model in which a multiple-level market is established among the primary, secondary, and tertiary services. We use the concept of demand and supply functions in economics to obtain the partial equilibrium for which all services are satisfied with the shared spectrum size and the charging price. These functions are derived based on the utility of the connections using the different services. In addition, we consider a system for which the global information is not available. Therefore, each service needs to learn and adapt the strategies to reach an equilibrium. Two iterative algorithms (i.e., excess demand-based and successive overrelaxation (SOR)) are proposed. The stability condition for the learning rate is analyzed for these algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.699","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio: A Microeconomic Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio: A Microeconomic Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224944/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583568","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224944/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio: A Microeconomic Approach","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S34P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043242S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224945,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Liao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Liao","id":"37285988700"},{"name":"Lemin Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lemin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280693400"},{"name":"Shizhong Xu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shizhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37286816400"},{"name":"Hongfang Yu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hongfang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275012100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224945","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Quality of service","Scheduling","Throughput","Traffic control","Bandwidth","Resource management","Telecommunication traffic","Communications Society","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","quality of service","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication channels","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic aided opportunistic scheduling","QoS support","quality of service","multiservice CDMA uplink","code division multiple access","resource allocation","wireless CDMA network","real-time communication services","nonreal-time communication services","channel condition","cross-layer information","file size information","uplink wireless CDMA system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of resource allocation with efficiency and quality of service (QoS) support in uplink for a wireless CDMA network supporting real-time (RT) and nonreal-time (NRT) communication services.

In the previous work, the problem about congestion of voice in IP-based CDMA RAN was examined and several policies were brought forward and evaluated with the assistance of simulations (Kasera et al., 2005). In this paper, we first develop a mathematical model to investigate the multi-region soft-handoff of the IP-based CDMA RAN and analyze its systematic characteristics. The effectiveness of the developed mathematical model is demonstrated by simulations. We then propose a max-leg-limit control policy to improve the system performance in terms of the blocking rate and the number of users. We also extend it to a more general situation, where instant video, instant data and voice are provided within an IP-based CDMA RAN. For such a multiple priority instant service system, we propose two control mechanisms, borrow-leg and router buffer preservation, to control the quality of services. Simulation shows that the control mechanisms are effective in keeping the quality of multi-priority services.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224947.pdf","startPage":"3838","endPage":"3843","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion and Access Control Policies of Multi-Priority Instant Services for IP-Based CDMA Radio Access Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Multiaccess communication","Radio access networks","Control systems","Quality of service","Mathematical model","Base stations","System performance","Radio network","Radio control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","code division multiple access","quality of service","radio access networks","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["congestion control","access control","multipriority instant services","IP-based CDMA radio access networks","code division multiple access","multiregion soft-handoff","max-leg-limit control policy","blocking rate","borrow-leg","router buffer preservation","quality of service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Congestion and Access Control Policies of Multi-Priority Instant Services for IP-Based CDMA Radio Access Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224947/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583571","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion and Access Control Policies of Multi-Priority Instant Services for IP-Based CDMA Radio Access Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S35P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048736S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4224959,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37289572000"},{"name":"Hong-Hsu Yen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Shih Hsin University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Hsu","lastName":"Yen","id":"37307435400"},{"name":"Sudhir Dixit","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Burlington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhir","lastName":"Dixit","id":"37274340600"},{"name":"Biswanath Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Biswanath","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37278576400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4224959","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed Integer Programming Model for Optimum Placement of Base Stations and Optical Network Units in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","abstract":"The concept of a hybrid wireless-optical broadband access network (referred to as WOBAN here) is a very attractive one. This is because it may be costly in several situations to run fiber to every home from the telecom central office (CO); also, providing wireless access from the CO to every end user may not be possible because of limited spectrum. Thus, running fiber as far as possible from the CO towards the end user and then having wireless access technologies take over may be an excellent compromise. How far should fiber penetrate before wireless takes over is an interesting engineering design and optimization problem, which our study is focussing on. We propose and investigate the characteristics of a \"mixed integer programming (MIP)\" model for optimum placements of base stations (BS) and optical network units (ONU) in a WOBAN (primal problem). We develop several constraints to be satisfied: BS and ONU installation, user and channel assignment, and signal-quality and interference constraints. To solve this MIP with reasonable accuracy, we use \"Lagrangean relaxation\" to obtain the corresponding \"Lagrangean dual\" problem. Via simulation experiments, we verify how sensitive is the placement problem with respect to a set of chosen metrics.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224959.pdf","startPage":"3907","endPage":"3911","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.714","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.714","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224959","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Base stations","Optical network units","Interference constraints","Passive optical networks","Lagrangian functions","Costs","Optical fiber networks","Optical scattering","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","integer programming","optical fibre networks","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed integer programming model","base stations","optical network units","hybrid wireless-optical broadband access network","telecom central office","wireless access technologies","engineering design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224959/","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed Integer Programming Model for Optimum Placement of Base Stations and Optical Network Units in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","accessionNumber":"9583583","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224959/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed Integer Programming Model for Optimum Placement of Base Stations and Optical Network Units in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S37P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054533S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4224967,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decisions systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37400482800"},{"name":"Henk Wymeersch","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decisions systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Wymeersch","id":"37269700200"},{"name":"Moe Z.

In a dense obstacle environment, anchors (or base stations) may not be able to provide sufficient localization information to agents because of radio blockage or limited range. In such cases, cooperation among agents (or mobile stations) can be very helpful. In this paper, we develop a model for cooperative localization based on time-of-arrival (TOA) ranging information and derive the position error bound (PEB) for agents in the network using information inequality. Equivalent Fisher information (EFI), which has been applied in the single agent localization case (Sen and Win, 2007), is employed to characterize the localization accuracy. From analysis, we also show that anchors and agents are essentially equivalent in our unified cooperative localization model.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.722","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","startPage":"3951","endPage":"3955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Cooperative Localization via Fisher Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Cooperative Localization via Fisher Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224967/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583591","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4224967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Cooperative Localization via Fisher Information","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S38P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06883S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4224972,"authors":[{"name":"Bong-Jun Ko","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

We take a modular approach by decoupling the channel selection decision from the data forwarding mechanism, which makes our solution readily applicable to real-world operation when used with emerging multi-radio routing solutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our protocol on a real-world, 14-node testbed comprised of nodes, each equipped with an 802.11a card and an 802.11g card.

Our performance evaluations demonstrate that the scheme can satisfactorily allocate multi-beam satellite resources to greatly increase communication capacity and still improve the communication quality, thus ensuring QoS under various user distribution and traffic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.732","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04224977.pdf","startPage":"4008","endPage":"4012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for QoS Provision in Multi-beam Mobile Satellite Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4224977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4224977/","displayDocTitle":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for QoS Provision in Multi-beam Mobile Satellite Communication Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583601","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4224977/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource Allocation Scheme for QoS Provision in Multi-beam Mobile Satellite Communication Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S41P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062613S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4224977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4225007,"authors":[{"name":"Xinsheng Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xinsheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37696887400"},{"name":"Jian Qi","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Qi","id":"37686899300"},{"name":"Hao Liang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37689167900"},{"name":"Xiaohu Yu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"Yu","id":"37293161000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0658-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0659-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2612"}],"articleNumber":"4225007","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Performance analysis","Wireless networks","Cyclic redundancy check","Capacity planning","Analytical models","System performance","Error analysis","Communications Society","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel capacity","code division multiple access","radio links","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA","high speed wireless link","wireless network planning","analytical capacity dimensioning","system performance","high speed wireless transmission technologies","H-ARQ","AMC","fast scheduling","system capacity","link level capacity","system level capacity","HSDPA","HSUPA"]}],"abstract":"Capacity dimensioning is one of the key problems in wireless network planning.

In such deployment, the network topology based on a tree structure can be efficiently and quickly constructed among the cognitive terminals (CT) by using the cognitive base station (CBS) as a root, to support the multihop communication. However, the original tree-based routing (TBR) protocol is designed to handle a single wireless system such as IEEE802.11a or lib, and thus can not be applied to the cognitive networks configured with multiple wireless systems, which may have the different bandwidths and transmission ranges. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper an efficient and practical protocol, called cognitive tree-based routing (CTBR) protocol, which extends and significantly enhances the ability of the known TBR protocol to enable it to support multiple wireless systems such as IEEE802.11g and IEEE802.11j. Simulation results reveal that our proposed CTBR protocol that utilizes the cognitive-aware link metric to select a route with the best end-to-end metric and an interface with the least local load for any source-destination pair, achieves much higher performance than the utilization of normal metric associated with the hop count.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2007.768","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4204175/4224245/04225013.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4224245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2007.768","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","startPage":"4204","endPage":"4208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-Based Routing Protocol for Cognitive Wireless Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4225013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Tree-Based Routing Protocol for Cognitive Wireless Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4225013/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4225013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9583637","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-Based Routing Protocol for Cognitive Wireless Access Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S48P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044908S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4225013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4225022,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For delay-tolerant applications like latency-insensitive bulk data transfer, we seek to maximize throughput by having a UAV load from a source ground node, carry the data while flying to the destination, and finally deliver the data to a destination ground node. We term this the \"load-carry-and-deliver\" (LCAD) paradigm and compare it against the conventional multi-hop, store-and-forward paradigm. We identify and analyze several of the most important factors in constructing a throughput-maximizing framework subject to constraints on both application allowable delay and UAV maneuverability. We report performance measurement results for IEEE 802.11g devices in three flight tests, based on which we derive a statistical model for predicting throughput performance for LCAD. Due to the nature of commercial off-the-shelf systems, this methodology is of essential importance for allowing better flight-path design to achieve high throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4225050/","conferenceDate":"11-15 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 March 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9583674","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4225050/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing Throughput of UAV-Relaying Networks with the Load-Carry-and-Deliver Paradigm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing Throughput of UAV-Relaying Networks with the Load-Carry-and-Deliver Paradigm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"T3S54P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061919S","chronDate":"11-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4204175","isNumber":"4224245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4204175","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4224245","articleId":"4225050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4225242,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The aim of this study was to record epicardial activity during early human VF and analyse the electrical signals in order to characterise the complexity of activity and to estimate the number of reentrant sources driving the VF. In 10 patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery, VF was induced by burst pacing and a 20-40 s episode of fibrillatory activity was recorded from a dense array of unipolar electrodes spanning the entire epicardium. Dominant frequencies were computed using the fast Fourier transform. Activation times were computed at the minimum negative slopes of the electrograms. Phase singularities and activation wavefronts were identified and quantified. We found that early human VF was typically sustained by a small number of re-entrant sources that were associated with large and coherent wavefronts. However, at times we also observed a large number of small wavefronts. Our results suggest that multiple electrophysiological mechanisms sustain VF in the human heart.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IET 3rd International Conference On Advances in Medical, Signal and Information Processing - MEDSIP 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/4225193/4225194/04225242.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2006 IET 3rd International Conference On Advances in Medical, Signal and Information Processing - MEDSIP 2006","doi":"10.1049/cp:20060366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20060366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4225194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4225242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epicardial ECG Mapping of Human Ventricular Fibrillation","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arrhythmia","ventricular fibrillation","reentry","activation wavefront","cardiac mapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4225242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Epicardial ECG Mapping of Human Ventricular Fibrillation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epicardial ECG Mapping of Human Ventricular Fibrillation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"MEDSIP-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036656S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2006","isNumber":"4225194","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4225193","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4225242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4225303,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel T.

All the known methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated-phase detector or as a linear-synchronous detector. Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through the power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer asymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted amplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of 5-50 mV, which is 12-35 dB lower than the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting the mixer at a sweet point - off the quadrature condition - where the sensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers do not have this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from the oscillator under test, it cannot be rejected by correlation. At least not with the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical frequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order - if not greater - than the phase noise.

FIELD II, which determines the two-way temporal response of a transducer at a point in space, is the current de facto standard for ultrasound simulation tools. However, the need often arises to obtain two-way spatial responses at a single point in time, a set of dimensions for which FIELD II is not well optimized. This paper describes an analytical approach for computing the two-way, far-field, spatial impulse response from rectangular transducer elements under arbitrary excitation. The described approach determines the response as the sum of polynomial functions, making computational implementation quite straightforward. The proposed algorithm, named DELFI, was implemented as a C routine under Matlab and results were compared to those obtained under similar conditions from the well-established FIELD II program. Under the specific conditions tested here, the proposed algorithm was approximately 142 times faster than FIELD II for computing spatial sensitivity functions with similar amounts of error. For temporal sensitivity functions with similar amounts of error, the proposed algorithm was about 1.7 times slower than FIELD II using rectangular elements and 19.2 times faster than FIELD II using triangular elements.

For example, an insulator in the shape of a truncated frustum is free from charging. However, since such insulator has inevitably large volume, it obstructs the compactness. On the other hand, roughening insulator surface is also effective to prevent the surface from charging. In this case, the cost for roughening the entire surface may be high when the insulator is large. In this paper we review our previous investigation results and describe new experimental results aimed at developing feasible and compact insulators used in vacuum. Surface charging characteristics of partially and mechanically processed insulators have been studied for this purpose. That is, the charging phenomena when such insulators are exposed to a ramped DC or AC voltage have been observed by using a capacitive probe embedded in the cathode. Firstly, we describe of a partially roughened cylindrical insulator, where the height of the roughened surface measured from the cathode is varied keeping the total length constant. Secondly, we describe a cylindrical insulator having a truncated conical frustum or a chamfer at its cathode-side end. Based on these experimental and simulation results we prove that the partial mechanical processing is effective to control and suppress the insulator charging in vacuum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depression of insulator charging in vacuum by partial mechanical processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2007.369520","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4225321/04225336.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2007.369520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4225321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4225336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4225336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Depression of insulator charging in vacuum by partial mechanical processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4225336/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9530433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depression of insulator charging in vacuum by partial mechanical processing","sourcePdf":"p606-yamamoto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065071S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4225321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4225321","articleId":"4225336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4225339,"authors":[{"name":"Takafumi Hosono","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/4225321/4225339/4225339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takafumi Hosono was born on 3 May 1983.

A comparative evaluation with other two well-known location techniques, i.e., time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and arrival time analysis (ATA) is presented through working cases. The results indicate that while TDR is appropriate for short cable systems, for longer cable systems, location by AF mapping can be obtained directly from PD testing, without additional efforts. The location thus achieved is, in most cases, accurate enough to allow maintenance practices to be carried out effectively. In some cases, ATA can be necessary to refine location and resolve ambiguities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polymers","Power cables","Partial discharges","Attenuation","Frequency","Reflectometry","Personal communication networks","Time domain analysis","System testing","Solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge measurement","polymers","power cable testing","time-domain reflectometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge location","polymeric cable system","amplitude-frequency mapping","AF mapping","attenuation","dispersion","time-domain reflectometry","TDR","arrival time analysis","ATA","PD testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2007.369537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4225321/04225353.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4225321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2007.369537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method to locate PD in polymeric cable systems based on amplitude-frequency (AF) map","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4225353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel method to locate PD in polymeric cable systems based on amplitude-frequency (AF) map","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4225353/","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4225353/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9530458","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method to locate PD in polymeric cable systems based on amplitude-frequency (AF) map","sourcePdf":"p726-cavallini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058591S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4225321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4225321","articleId":"4225353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4225356,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Theethayi","affiliation":["Division for Electricity and Lightning Research, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Nelson Theethayi (S'04-M'06) was born in India, in 1975.

In view of the frequency contents that typically characterize such transients, the behavior of the ground impedance and admittance is studied for a wide frequency range up to 10 MHz. Low frequency approximation of the ground impedance is not always appropriate for transient analysis. Sensitivity analyses show that, unlike overhead wires, the ground impedance for buried wires is little sensitive to the ground conductivity. On the other hand, the ground admittance varies strongly with the ground conductivity. The paper also discusses the results of transient analysis of buried cables performed by means of electromagnetic transient programs (EMTP) that neglect the ground admittance. The limits of such an approximation are discussed in order to evaluate the applicability of EMTP-like programs to the transient analysis of buried conductors. Transient pulse propagation in time domain based on finite difference time domain (FDTD) method of solution of TL equations is also discussed for a future inclusion of non-linear phenomena, like soil ionization and arcing/breakdown mechanisms, in the soil. The analysis presented could be useful in estimating surge propagation characteristics of buried wires for appropriate insulation coordination and transient protection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4225321/04225356.pdf","startPage":"751","endPage":"761","publicationTitle":"IEEE

generation of prosthetic systems. A novel multichannel regeneration-type nerve electrode that was designed to record from and stimulate peripheral nerves has been developed to allow for the control of artificial hands and to generate artificial sensations. In this study we propose a neural probe with multiple microfluidic channels for measuring signals from regenerated axons passing through the fluidic channels. Each channel also serves as a guidance tube of the nerve regeneration and as fluidic pathways for injecting chemicals such as nerve growth factors (NGF). Parylene microfluidic channels were formed with microelectrodes and then the substrate was rolled up, resulting in bundled channels. We have succeeded in injecting NGF from the channels and observed the regeneration of an axon guided by the channels.","doi":"10.1109/CNE.2007.369600","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227184/4227185/04227205.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","startPage":"17","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNE.2007.369600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bundled Microfluidic Channels for Nerve Regeneration Electrodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bundled Microfluidic Channels for Nerve Regeneration Electrodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227205/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227205/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9518598","publicationDate":"May 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bundled Microfluidic Channels for Nerve Regeneration Electrodes","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CNE-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059478S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227184","isNumber":"4227185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227184","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4227185","articleId":"4227205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4227206,"authors":[{"name":"David Cheney","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cheney","id":"37349598900"},{"name":"Aik Goh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Aik","lastName":"Goh","id":"37686957100"},{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37577830500"},{"name":"Karl Gugel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Gugel","id":"37297052100"},{"name":"John G.

MEAs, however, have limitations of their electrode numbers and densities, resulting in low spatial resolutions of stimulation and recording. Here, to overcome this problem, we propose and develop an experimental setup for light-addressed stimulation and simultaneous fluorescence calcium imaging, using the previously published light-addressable electrode. The electrode has a translucent thin-film-laminated structure and allows optical access from both sides of the substrate. We, thus, provided the fluorescence excitation light from the topside and an addressing illumination from the bottom. By instantly shutting out the fluorescence excitation light during the stimulus application, we prevented the excitation light from interfering with the addressing illumination. With this experimental setup, we successfully measured spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activities evoked by light-addressed stimuli. Evoked fluorescence transients with hundred-millisecond latencies suggested the possibility that some neurons were activated by recurrent synaptic inputs, which were possibly overlooked by previous MEA studies.","doi":"10.1109/CNE.2007.369611","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227184/4227185/04227216.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNE.2007.369611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light-Addressed Stimulation and Simultaneous Calcium Imaging for Probing Spatio-Temporal Activity of Cultured Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calcium","Neural networks","Fluorescence","Electrodes","Optical imaging","Optical recording","Lighting","Probes","Microelectrodes","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light-addressed stimulation","spatiotemporal activity probing","cultured neural network","microelectrode arrays","simultaneous fluorescence calcium imaging","light-addressable electrode","translucent thin-film-laminated structure","optical access","fluorescence excitation light","stimulus application","spatiotemporal patterns","evoked fluorescence transients","recurrent synaptic inputs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Light-Addressed Stimulation and Simultaneous Calcium Imaging for Probing Spatio-Temporal Activity of Cultured Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light-Addressed Stimulation and Simultaneous Calcium Imaging for Probing Spatio-Temporal Activity of Cultured Neural Network","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CNE-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092505S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2007","isNumber":"4227185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227184","articleId":"4227216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227239,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Rohrer","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems,Robotics and Cybernetics Group, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Rohrer","id":"37680404800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0791-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0792-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3546"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3554"}],"articleNumber":"4227239","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomimetics","Robot control","Libraries","Humans","Machine learning","Sparse matrices","Cognition","Brain modeling","Intelligent robots","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","brain models","cognition","intelligent control","learning (artificial intelligence)","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-learning","biomimetic algorithm","robots","sequence-based learning algorithm","human motor behavior","quantized sensory information","brain-emulating cognition and control architecture","human-inspired learning","point-to-point reaching task"]}],"abstract":"S-learning is a sequence-based learning algorithm patterned on human motor behavior.

For electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI, motor imagery is considered as one of the most effective ways. Different imagery activities can be classified based on the changes in mu and/or beta rhythms and their spatial distributions. However, the change in these rhythmic patterns varies from one subject to another. This causes an unavoidable time-consuming fine-tuning process in building a BCI for every subject. To address this issue, we propose a new method called sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) to solve the problem. First, we decompose the EEG signals into sub-bands using a filter bank. Subsequently, we apply a discriminative analysis to extract SBCSP features. The SBCSP features are then fed into linear discriminant analyzers (LDA) to obtain scores which reflect the classification capability of each frequency band. Finally, the scores are fused to make decision. We evaluate two fusion methods: recursive band elimination (RBE) and meta-classifier (MC). We assess our approaches on a standard database from BCI Competition III. We also compare our method with two other approaches that address the same issue. The results show that our method outperforms the other two approaches and achieves similar result as compared to the best one in the literature which was obtained by a time-consuming fine-tuning process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) for Brain-Computer Interface","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CNE.2007.369647","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227184/4227185/04227252.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNE.2007.369647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) for Brain-Computer Interface","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227252/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518669","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) for Brain-Computer Interface","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CNE-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038197S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227184","isNumber":"4227185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227184","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"4227185","articleId":"4227252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4227272,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Sajda","affiliation":["Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Sajda","id":"37276046800"},{"name":"Robin I.

We conclude that EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is of high enough fidelity to permit single-trial analysis.","doi":"10.1109/CNE.2007.369667","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227184/4227185/04227272.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNE.2007.369667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A System for Single-trial Analysis of Simultaneously Acquired EEG and fMRI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Electrodes","Resistors","Neural engineering","USA Councils","Metalworking machines","Signal resolution","High-resolution imaging","Image analysis","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","electroencephalography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-trial analysis","EEG","fMRI","neural components","auditory oddball stimulus paradigm","power spectra","single-trial discrimination performance","echo planer image acquisition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A System for Single-trial Analysis of Simultaneously Acquired EEG and fMRI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518667","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System for Single-trial Analysis of Simultaneously Acquired EEG and fMRI","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CNE-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041577S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227184","isNumber":"4227185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227184","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4227185","articleId":"4227272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4227275,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander J.

A small permanent magnet secured on the tongue using a tongue clip, tissue adhesive, or tongue piercing is utilized as a marker to track tongue movements. The magnetic field variations due to the marker movements are detected by an array of magnetic sensors mounted on a headset outside the mouth or an orthodontic brace inside. The sensor outputs are then processed and translated into different user control commands after being wirelessly transmitted to a portable computer (PC or PDA). These commands can be used to access a computer by substituting the mouse or keyboard functions. They can also be customized to operate a powered wheelchair, a phone, or other equipments. For human trials, we have developed a prototype system with 6 direct commands on a baseball helmet and successfully tested it.

Spikes of different frequency and amplitude from different channels are identified to construct unique signatures and relate them to physiological activities. A vocabulary-based communication of recorded action potentials renders two major advantages: a) it allows transmission of recorded data with large compression, thus, saving power and communication bandwidth of the integrated telemetry device; b) it helps easy mapping of alphabets in the vocabulary to muscular dynamics, which facilitates micro-stimulation based neural prostheses. In this work, we study the effectiveness of the proposed approach in neural data compression. Simulation results on pre-recorded data from the buccal nerves of a sea-slug shows that the proposed approach results in up to 80X compression","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Data Compression with Wavelet Transform: A Vocabulary Based Approach","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CNE.2007.369760","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227184/4227185/04227365.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNE.2007.369760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Data Compression with Wavelet Transform: A Vocabulary Based Approach","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227365/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9508085","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Data Compression with Wavelet Transform: A Vocabulary Based Approach","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"CNE-00-180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078582S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227184","isNumber":"4227185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227184","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4227185","articleId":"4227365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4227402,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin M.

The measurement capabilities include radiation efficiency, radiated power, diversity gain, MIMO system capacity and receiver sensitivity. In the latter case the reverberation chamber enable fast measurements of bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER), and thereby total isotropic sensitivity (TIS). In addition, the terminals can be tested under realistic and continuous fading very similar to what is present in urban and indoor environments, referred to as average fading sensitivity (AFS). The chamber is the only known measurement instrument for directly measuring diversity gain and channel capacity; the alternative being to drive measurement instruments around in an actual urban environment. The measurements can fast and easily be performed for different talk positions relative to a head phantom.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227418/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9529455","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Overview of 6 Years R&D on Characterizing Wireless Devices in Rayleigh Fading Using Reverberation Chambers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of 6 Years R&D on Characterizing Wireless Devices in Rayleigh Fading Using Reverberation Chambers","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052616S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227375","isNumber":"4227376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227375","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4227376","articleId":"4227418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4227421,"authors":[{"name":"Jerzy Guterman","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Guterman","id":"37270473300"},{"name":"Yahya Rahmat-Samii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Rahmat-Samii","id":"38272988200"},{"name":"Antonio A.

Therefore, an accurate evaluation of the radiation pattern requires a proper modelling of the laptop housing effects. Due to the large laptop dimensions, this antenna-PC integrated approach leads to a minimum far field distance of at least 12 meters at the WLAN frequency bands. Such a large distance is not easily accommodated in indoor far-field measurement ranges. A near field measurement technique seems appropriate to solve the problem. This study reports 2.4/5.2 GHz laptop internal antenna housing effects on the far field radiation pattern. The full wave simulations are compared with measurement results obtained in UCLA near field spherical range. A very good agreement obtained for all the investigated scenarios confirms that the near field technique is adequate to deal with this type of measurement problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Pattern of a 2.4/ 5.2GHz Laptop Internal Antenna: Near Field Spherical Range Measurements and Full Wave Analysis","publicationTitle":"2007 International workshop on Antenna Technology: Small and Smart Antennas Metamaterials and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IWAT.2007.370105","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International workshop on Antenna Technology: Small and Smart Antennas Metamaterials and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227375/4227376/04227421.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAT.2007.370105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Pattern of a 2.4/ 5.2GHz Laptop Internal Antenna: Near Field Spherical Range Measurements and Full Wave Analysis","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227421/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9529457","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Pattern of a 2.4/ 5.2GHz Laptop Internal Antenna: Near Field Spherical Range Measurements and Full Wave Analysis","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071576S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227375","isNumber":"4227376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227375","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4227376","articleId":"4227421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4227427,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

An antenna plays a key role in a radio as it has independent properties that affect the radio as a whole. Antenna designs for radio operating at 60 GHz or above are turning to antenna-on-chip (AoC) and antenna-in-package (AiP) solutions. In this paper we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of two novel AiPs in ceramic ball grid array packages using low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology for 60-GHz radio. LTCC process can embed high-quality passives in low loss ceramic substrates, while allowing active devices to be mounted on/in them. The LTCC process produces mechanically strong, hermetically sealed, thermally conductive, chemically inert, and dimensionally stable structures with high yield. Therefore, the LTCC process has recently been added to the narrow list of technologies capable of realizing millimeter-wave wireless systems","doi":"10.1109/IWAT.2007.370129","publicationTitle":"2007 International workshop on Antenna Technology: Small and Smart Antennas Metamaterials and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International workshop on Antenna Technology: Small and Smart Antennas Metamaterials and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227375/4227376/04227445.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWAT.2007.370129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227376","startPage":"279","endPage":"282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna-in-Package in LTCC for 60-GHz Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna-in-Package in LTCC for 60-GHz Radio","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227445/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9506778","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227445/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna-in-Package in LTCC for 60-GHz Radio","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"IWAT-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059824S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227375","isNumber":"4227376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227375","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4227376","articleId":"4227445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4227447,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Long Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hua Long","lastName":"Sun","id":"38087089700"},{"name":"Wen Xun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wen Xun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291410100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1088-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4227447","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"abstract":"Transmit-array (TA) has advantages such as low profile, easy fabrication, flexible element structure, and multi-function etc. It receives spherical wave and adjust its phases to re-radiate forwards.

Carrying it out from unmanned aerial vehicles is expensive in terms of both manpower and hardware. In this paper, we discuss the creation of a distributed ATR (DATR) method which replaces a single monolithic approach to ATR with a more robust multi-agent method. We present software and algorithms which have been developed for the purpose of testing and proving the validity of DATR, as well as some of the implementation possibilities and steps which we have taken to further prove the validity of the approach. Our examples and experiments with the normal light-weight ATR algorithms for our agents, combined with a fusion method based on belief calculus to demonstrate what DATR would perform like, show the validity of the approach","doi":"10.1109/KIMAS.2007.369806","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Integration of Knowledge Intensive Multi-Agent Systems","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KIMAS.2007.369806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227508","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227507/4227508/04227545.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Integration of Knowledge Intensive Multi-Agent Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Target recognition","Military computing","Surveillance","Costs","Protection","Sensor fusion","Cameras","Law enforcement","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","multi-agent systems","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical fusion","unmanned aerial vehicle observations","aided target recognition","target detection","target classification","multiagent method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Fusion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Observations for Aided Target Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227545/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227545/","accessionNumber":"9508118","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"April-May 2007","conferenceDate":"30 April-3 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2007-May 3 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Fusion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Observations for Aided Target Recognition","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"KIMAS-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068581S","chronDate":"April 30 2007-May 3 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227507","isNumber":"4227508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227507","xplore-issue":"4227508","articleId":"4227545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4227559,"authors":[{"name":"Raheel Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illionis University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Raheel","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37561564900"},{"name":"Yung-Chuan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illionis University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yung-Chuan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37635510600"},{"name":"Shahram Rahimi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illionis University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Rahimi","id":"37278359500"},{"name":"Bidyut Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southern Illionis University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Bidyut","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37340509200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0944-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0945-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4227559","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Multiagent systems","Computational intelligence","Intelligent agent","Stochastic processes","Space exploration","Computer science","Birds","Software agents","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","multiagent system","asynchronous execution","dynamic resource","informative resource"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227559","abstract":"We propose a new approach towards particle swarm optimization named agent-based PSO.

The transistor was operated at 1.9 GHz under real-world load and power conditions. Threshold voltage and sub-threshold slope were monitored as a measure of the device degradation versus stress time. Experimental evidence is provided, which demonstrates that damage severity strongly depends on the features of drain voltage and current waveforms, rather than on average dissipated power. The results of RF stress tests are compared to dc hot carrier and Fowler-Nordheim experiments. Large discrepancies are found between measurements and the quasi-static model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation Mechanisms in CMOS Power Amplifiers Subject to Radio-Frequency Stress and Comparison to the DC Case","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369873","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227614.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227614","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Degradation Mechanisms in CMOS Power Amplifiers Subject to Radio-Frequency Stress and Comparison to the DC Case","conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227614/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9573446","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation Mechanisms in CMOS Power Amplifiers Subject to Radio-Frequency Stress and Comparison to the DC Case","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083884S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227627,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The gate structures with trap layers remained on source and drain regions showed increased charge loss compared to the one with trap layers separated between different gate lines. The improvement by removing the trap layers between gate lines suggests that the lateral charge spreading via trap layers from the programmed cells to the adjacent erased cells contributes to the charge loss of the TANOS cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227628/","conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9573457","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Lateral Charge Spreading on the Reliability of TANOS (TaN/AlO/SiN/Oxide/Si) NAND Flash Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Lateral Charge Spreading on the Reliability of TANOS (TaN/AlO/SiN/Oxide/Si) NAND Flash Memory","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049763S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4227631,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Geun Jee","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Geun","lastName":"Jee","id":"37686144000"},{"name":"WookHyun Kwon","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Development Team, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"WookHyun","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37290201600"},{"name":"Woong Lee","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37366209800"},{"name":"Jung-Hyun Park","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Hyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37087035991"},{"name":"Hyeong-Ki Kim","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-Ki","lastName":"Kim","id":"37088815217"},{"name":"Ho-Min Son","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Min","lastName":"Son","id":"37088815917"},{"name":"Won-Jun Chang","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Jun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37088815583"},{"name":"Jae-Jong Han","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Jong","lastName":"Han","id":"37692982300"},{"name":"Yong-Woo Hyung","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Woo","lastName":"Hyung","id":"37088816035"},{"name":"Hyeon-Deok Lee","affiliation":["Process Technology Team, Semiconductor Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeon-Deok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088815843"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0918-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0919-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"}],"articleNumber":"4227631","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"abstract":"The reliability properties of NOR flash memory with 65nm node being developed in Samsung electronics are greatly improved by using the newly proposed re-oxidized tunnel oxide.

As such, these models have mostly focused on the stress phase. The relaxation phase, on the other hand, has not received as much attention, possibly because of the contradictory results published so far. Particularly noteworthy are the very long relaxation tails of almost logarithmic nature, which cannot be successfully described by the reaction-diffusion model. The authors argue that understanding the nature of the relaxation phase could hold the key to unraveling the underlying NBTI mechanism. In particular, the authors stipulate that the relaxation phase follows a universal relaxation law, demonstrate the valuable consequences resulting therefrom, and use this universality to classify presently available NBTI models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227645.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"280","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Universality of NBTI Relaxation and its Implications for Modeling and Characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Stress","Interface states","Threshold voltage","Delay","CMOS technology","Temperature","Silicon","Photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reaction-diffusion systems","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability","stress relaxation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative biased temperature instability","NBTI","stress phase","relaxation phase","reaction-diffusion model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Universality of NBTI Relaxation and its Implications for Modeling and Characterization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227645/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9573466","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Universality of NBTI Relaxation and its Implications for Modeling and Characterization","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107945S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227648,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

Recent test circuits and test methods have quantified the pulse widths of DSETs generated from heavy-ion strikes on critical microcircuit nodes. These pulse widths have proven to be much larger than previously thought, which substantiates the importance of DSET induced errors to the soft error rate (SER) of modern microcircuits. New DSET circuit modeling approaches are presented which couple the circuit response to the charge collection mechanisms responsible for forming the DSET. These new circuit charge collection models successfully account for the experimentally observed heavy-ion induced transient widths and are supported by fully-coupled 3-d device physics simulations. Novel hardening and mitigation approaches are proposed based on our new understanding of the circuit response mechanisms. These new techniques are non-invasive to existing fabrication processes and can be transparently applied to existing bulk CMOS microcircuit layouts.","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369907","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227648.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","startPage":"293","endPage":"305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEU and SET Modeling and Mitigation in Deep Submicron Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227648","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SEU and SET Modeling and Mitigation in Deep Submicron Technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227648/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9573469","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227648/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU and SET Modeling and Mitigation in Deep Submicron Technologies","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103978S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4227649,"authors":[{"name":"O.A.

Many methods have been developed to increase critical charge requirement for storage elements, thereby reducing the soft error rates. Design-based approaches have been proposed that use four storage nodes instead of two nodes to retain data. Such designs are considered single event upset (SEU) immune at low energy ion hits for all practical purposes because a single ion hit at a storage node does not cause an upset. However, such designs are vulnerable to ion hits that result in multiple nodes collecting charges. For deep sub-micron technologies, the proximity of circuit nodes results in charge collection at multiple nodes when a single ion strikes a node. Researchers first observed the effect of such charge sharing in SRAM designs. In this paper, circuit and 3D technology computer aided design (TCAD) mixed-mode simulations are used to characterize charge sharing between sensitive pairs of devices and the resulting upsets in a hardened storage cell. The simulation results were verified with experimental data showing upsets due to charge sharing in a hardened cell when exposed to low energy ions","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369908","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227649.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Event Upsets in a 130 nm Hardened Latch Design Due to Charge Sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227649","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Upsets in a 130 nm Hardened Latch Design Due to Charge Sharing","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227649/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9508168","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227649/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Upsets in a 130 nm Hardened Latch Design Due to Charge Sharing","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097023S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4227666,"authors":[{"name":"N.

PCM stores data in a chalcogenide material which can be placed in either a high resistance amorphous phase or a low resistance crystalline phase. Data retention is limited by resistance loss of the amorphous phase of the material, a process that is controlled by the kinetics of crystallization. This paper presents array-level data retention results on a statistical distribution of PCM cells that shows the failure rate with temperature to be well-described by the Arrhenius equation and distributed lognormally with time. For typical cells, the retention capability exceeds 100,000 hours at 85degC and is capable of meeting product requirements. In non-optimized devices, however, we observe cells that fail earlier than the lognormal distribution would predict. The failure distribution of these cells is Weibull with time but shows similar temperature acceleration to the intrinsic distribution, indicative of a defect in the amorphous chalcogenide. Characterization of these cells shows that their retention behavior is erratic. Furthermore, it is not significantly changed by write cycling. We then show that this defect distribution can be suppressed by process architecture or write algorithm optimization. Retention data collected on cells at both the 180nm and 90nm lithography nodes show that the intrinsic behavior is maintained with process scaling","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369948","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","startPage":"542","endPage":"546","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Data Retention Characterization of Phase-Change Memory Arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227689/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9508180","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Retention Characterization of Phase-Change Memory Arrays","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046561S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227690,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The extrinsic failures can be linked to two activation energies: while one is 0.27 eV originated from oxygen-vacancy movements at the top interface and grain boundary in the ferroelectric films, the other is 0.86 eV caused by imperfection in either the top-electrode contact (TEC), or the bottom-electrode contact (BEC), or both, of the cell capacitor.

During the system-level ESD test, where the ICs in a system have been powered up, the feedback loop used in the power-rail ESD clamp circuit provides the lock function to keep the main ESD device in a \"latch-on\" state. The latch-on ESD device, which is often designed with a larger device dimension to sustain high ESD level, conducts a huge current between the power lines to perform a latchup-like failure after the system-level ESD test.

For sub-100 nm technology, the possible impacts from burn-in stress are negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) (Schroder and Babcock, 2003) on PFET and hot carrier effect (HCE) on NFET. Recently several groups (Muller et al., 2004 and LaRosa et al., 2006) reported the studies of NBTI impact on SRAM array performance, either using circuit simulation (Muller et al., 2004) or based on test results of discrete SRAM cell (LaRosa et al., 2006). Our study, for the first time, is directly based on the product results from burn-in stress on SRAM array. With device reliability models and circuit simulation, we analyzed the shift of key product parameters: SRAM array stand-by current (Iddq) and minimum array operation voltage (Vcsmin). Our studies show that PFET NBTI is the dominant factor that is responsible for the degradation of SRAM array stability, and its impact on Vcsmin is predictable by Iddq data and modeling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227744/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9573529","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Product Burn-in Stress Impacts on SRAM Array Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Product Burn-in Stress Impacts on SRAM Array Performance","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105271S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4227745,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The neutron peak-energy dependence of the ratio for MCU to the total number of upsets can be described by Weibull-type function with a threshold energy for the MCU. As a result of the 130nm SRAM test, the probability function of MCU can be approximated as a superposition of an exponential and a Lorentzian. We also demonstrate that the MCU/SEU ratio obtained by real-time measurements (RTSER) cross over the ASER data at around 20-40MeV. This indicates that the MCU obtained from ASER test using high neutron peak energy more than 50MeV tends to lead to an excessive estimation of the MCU/SEU ratio compared to the RTSER measurements. In addition, the effect due to anomalous noise has been studied and the phenomenon could be suggested as some special signs related to a geophysical mechanism and is expected to be investigated further with more analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227591/4227592/04227750.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings. 45th Annual","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2007.369566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Quantitative Analysis of Neutron-Induced Multi-Cell Upset in Deep Submicron SRAMs and of the Impact Due to Anomalous Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neutrons","Testing","Random access memory","Single event upset","Sea measurements","Frequency","Error correction codes","Semiconductor device noise","Sea level","Counting circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor device noise","semiconductor device reliability","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantitative analysis","neutron-induced multicell upset","deep submicron SRAM","anomalous noise","Weibull-type function","real-time measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Quantitative Analysis of Neutron-Induced Multi-Cell Upset in Deep Submicron SRAMs and of the Impact Due to Anomalous Noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9529957","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-19 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Quantitative Analysis of Neutron-Induced Multi-Cell Upset in Deep Submicron SRAMs and of the Impact Due to Anomalous Noise","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"RELPHY-00-158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036119S","chronDate":"15-19 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227591","isNumber":"4227592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227591","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4227592","articleId":"4227750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227777,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The system consists of photonic transducers and sources that can be easily incorporated in optical tags and base-stations. When an optical reader sends an interrogation beam of light to an optical tag, the tag sends its response. A major advantage of our system is that various electronic or photonic sensors or transducers can be easily incorporated in the design of optical tags so that the output of the sensors can be read remotely. The proposed system does not cause RF interference to nearby objects and is secure owing to the highly directional nature of optical communication. The system can use encryption technology to provide an additional layer of security. Unlike RF-IDs our system also provides flexibility on the distance between tags and base-stations or readers. Further, optical communication is unlicensed unlike the use of RF bands. Optical identification/interrogation systems proposed in the literature either uses specially designed MEMS devices or holograms. Compared to these our system is built with low-cost optoelectronic components and can be packaged in low-cost and rugged units.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227765/4227766/04227777.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","doi":"10.1109/THS.2007.370014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2007.370014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Free Space Optics Based Identification and Interrogation System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical sensors","Optoelectronic and photonic sensors","Optical design","Transducers","Sensor systems","Optical fiber communication","Electromagnetic interference","Cryptography","Communication system security","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optics","identification system","interrogation system","optical tags","photonic sensors","transducers","RF interference","optical communication","encryption technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Free Space Optics Based Identification and Interrogation System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9701600","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Free Space Optics Based Identification and Interrogation System","confLoc":"Woburn, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"THS-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039763S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227765","isNumber":"4227766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4227766","articleId":"4227777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4227788,"authors":[{"name":"Margaret H.

PS-SoR Volume I defined functional communication and interoperability requirements. Published in September, 2006, PS-SoR Volume II identifies quantitative performance metrics, including minimum video performance requirements for public safety's tactical video applications. The goal was not to identify what is achievable with current technology but rather, looking towards the future, to investigate the minimum level of performance that first responders need in order to effectively use their video equipment. On behalf of the SAFECOM Program and the Office of Law Enforcement Standards, the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) conducted subjective video quality testing to estimate the level of video quality that first responders find acceptable for tactical video applications. This subjective testing utilized source video content that is typical of public safety operations in structured subjective viewing experiments with 35 first responders. The evaluations from these first responders, in viewing high quality video (original video) and purposefully degraded video (using video compression and transmission equipment), allowed determination of basic quality thresholds for public safety tactical video applications. These perceptual quality thresholds have been translated into technical parameters for use by video equipment designers, manufacturers, and customers. This paper summarizes those findings. Other testing to evaluate requirements for other public safety applications is underway.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2007.370025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227766","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227765/4227766/04227788.pdf","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Performance Requirements for Tactical Video Applications","doi":"10.1109/THS.2007.370025","startPage":"85","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Performance Requirements for Tactical Video Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227788/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9701611","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227788/","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Performance Requirements for Tactical Video Applications","confLoc":"Woburn, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"THS-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040665S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227765","isNumber":"4227766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227765","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4227766","articleId":"4227788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4227810,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

These events occur routinely (almost daily) under normal system conditions. In these circumstances, the electric grid and its components usually respond in a manner so as to preserve the grid's integrity. However, in a time where threats to homeland security can involve threats to the electric grid, such disturbances caused by malicious (and perhaps multiple) attacks can cascade leading to the collapse of the entire electric grid. The goal of this work is to show that FNET can be an invaluable tool for enhancing situational awareness of the country's electric infrastructure especially in situations where the preservation of homeland security is critical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FNET: A Quickly Deployable and Economic System to Monitor the Electric Grid","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","doi":"10.1109/THS.2007.370047","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4227765/4227766/04227810.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2007.370047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"FNET: A Quickly Deployable and Economic System to Monitor the Electric Grid","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227810/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9701633","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FNET: A Quickly Deployable and Economic System to Monitor the Electric Grid","confLoc":"Woburn, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"THS-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04021S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4227765","isNumber":"4227766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4227765","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4227766","articleId":"4227810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4227813,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

Moreover, maintaining proper size for these partitions is crucial. The existing storage aware caching schemes assume linear relationship between cache size and hit ratio. But, in practice a (disk) partition may accumulate cache blocks (thus, choke the remaining disks) without increasing the hit ratio significantly. This disk choking phenomenon may degenerate the performance of the disk system. In this paper, we address this issue of disk choking and present a repartitioning framework based on the notion of marginal gains. Experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach. We show that our scheme outperforms the existing storage-aware caching schemes while supplied with a workload showing the non-linear relationship between cache size and hit ratio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Utility-based Approach to Cost-Aware Caching in Heterogeneous Storage Systems","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370240","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04227968.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Utility-based Approach to Cost-Aware Caching in Heterogeneous Storage Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227968/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516695","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Utility-based Approach to Cost-Aware Caching in Heterogeneous Storage Systems","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110193S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4227968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227976,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan","School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293134200"},{"name":"Hong Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279492700"},{"name":"Yasuo Tan","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Tan","id":"37400916400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4227976","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Energy consumption","Computer networks","Telecommunication traffic","Batteries","Protocols","Network topology","Relays","Computer science","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy balanced data gathering","wireless sensor network","energy consumption","hop-by-hop transmission","direct transmission","energy dissipation","optimal transmission probability allocation","chain network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Energy Balanced Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04227976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370248","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227976","abstract":"Unbalanced energy consumption is an inherent problem in wireless sensor networks where some nodes may be overused and die out early, resulting in a short network lifetime. In this paper, we investigate the problem of balancing energy consumption for data gathering sensor networks. Our key idea is to exploit the tradeoff between hop-by-hop transmission and direct transmission to balance energy dissipation among sensor nodes. By assigning each node a transmission probability which controls the ratio between hop-by-hop transmission and direct transmission, we formulate the energy consumption balancing problem as an optimal transmission probability allocation problem. We discuss this problem for both chain networks and general networks. Moreover, we present the solution to compute the optimal number of sections in terms of maximizing the network lifetime. Numerical results demonstrate that our methods outperform the traditional hop-by-hop and direct transmission schemes and achieve significant lifetime extension especially for dense sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9516717","htmlLink":"/document/4227976/","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Energy Balanced Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Energy Balanced Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066939S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4227976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227980,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Petrini","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Petrini","id":"37271662700"},{"name":"Gordon Fossum","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Fossum","id":"37698035600"},{"name":"Juan Fernandez","affiliation":["University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Fernandez","id":"37278905700"},{"name":"Ana Lucia Varbanescu","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ana Lucia","lastName":"Varbanescu","id":"37698034900"},{"name":"Mike Kistler","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Kistler","id":"37325835900"},{"name":"Michael Perrone","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

We present a complexity model for designing algorithms on the Cell processor, along with a systematic procedure for algorithm analysis. To estimate the execution time of the algorithm, we consider the computational complexity, memory access patterns (DMA transfer sizes and latency), and the complexity of branching instructions. This model, coupled with the analysis procedure, simplifies algorithm design on the Cell and enables quick identification of potential implementation bottlenecks. Using the model, we design an efficient implementation of list ranking, a representative problem from the class of combinatorial and graph-theoretic applications. Due to its highly irregular memory patterns, list ranking is a particularly challenging problem to parallelize on current cache-based and distributed memory architectures. We describe a generic work-partitioning technique on the Cell to hide memory access latency, and apply this to efficiently implement list ranking. We run our algorithm on a 3.2 GHz Cell processor using an IBM QS20 Cell Blade and demonstrate a substantial speedup for list ranking on the Cell in comparison to traditional cache-based microprocessors. For a random linked list of 1 million nodes, we achieve an an overall speedup of 8.34 over a PPE-only implementation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04227994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370266","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370266","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4227994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Microprocessors","Delay","Engines","Multicore processing","Computer architecture","Computational complexity","Coupled mode analysis","Memory architecture","Blades"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computational complexity","distributed shared memory systems","graph theory","memory architecture","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irregular parallel algorithms","Cell processor","list ranking","Sony-Toshiba-IBM Cell Broadband Engine","heterogeneous multicore architecture","computational complexity","memory access patterns","combinatorial application","graph-theoretic application","cache-based memory architecture","distributed memory architecture","work-partitioning technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227994/","displayDocTitle":"On the Design and Analysis of Irregular Algorithms on the Cell Processor: A Case Study of List Ranking","accessionNumber":"9516735","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4227994/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design and Analysis of Irregular Algorithms on the Cell Processor: A Case Study of List Ranking","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059503S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4227994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4227995,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Blagojevic","affiliation":["Center for High-end Computing Systems Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Blagojevic","id":"37695693100"},{"name":"Alexandros Stamatakis","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Sciences, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Stamatakis","id":"37266841200"},{"name":"Christos D.

While exploring these optimizations, we present solutions to problems related to floating point code execution, complex control flow, communication, scheduling, and multilevel parallelization on the cell.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370267","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04227995.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAxML-Cell: Parallel Phylogenetic Tree Inference on the Cell Broadband Engine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4227995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RAxML-Cell: Parallel Phylogenetic Tree Inference on the Cell Broadband Engine","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516752","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4227995/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAxML-Cell: Parallel Phylogenetic Tree Inference on the Cell Broadband Engine","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072511S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4227995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4228019,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshminarayanan Renganarayana","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Lakshminarayanan","lastName":"Renganarayana","id":"37689315600"},{"name":"Manjukumar Harthikote-Matha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Manjukumar","lastName":"Harthikote-Matha","id":"38278001200"},{"name":"Rinku Dewri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Rinku","lastName":"Dewri","id":"37689176300"},{"name":"Sanjay Rajopadhye","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Rajopadhye","id":"37352391400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228019","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concurrent computing","Tiles","Law","Legal factors","Space exploration","High performance computing","Parallel processing","Shape","Analytical models","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","mathematics computing","parallel processing","program compilers","program control structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multilevel tiling","parallelization strategies","loop sizes","computation-communication code balance","processor architecture","message startup costs","design-space exploration","3D Gauss-Siedel stencil computation"]}],"abstract":"Stencil computations form the performance-critical core of many applications. Tiling and parallelization are two important optimizations to speed up stencil computations. Many tiling and parallelization strategies are applicable to a given stencil computation. The best strategy depends not only on the combination of the two techniques, but also on many parameters: tile and loop sizes in each dimension; computation-communication balance of the code; processor architecture; message startup costs; etc. The best choices can only be determined through design-space exploration, which is extremely tedious and error prone to do via exhaustive experimentation. We characterize the space of multi-level tilings and parallelizations for 2D/3D Gauss-Siedel stencil computation. A systematic exploration of a part of this space enabled us to derive a design which is up to a factor of two faster than the standard implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Optimal Multi-level Tiling for Stencil Computations","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370291","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228019.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Towards Optimal Multi-level Tiling for Stencil Computations","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228019/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516703","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Optimal Multi-level Tiling for Stencil Computations","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06641S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4228043,"authors":[{"name":"Jay Smith","affiliation":["IBM, Boulder, CO, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Smith","id":"37277158600"},{"name":"Luis D.

Robustness can be defined as the degree to which a system can function correctly in the presence of parameter values different from those assumed. We present a methodology for quantifying the robustness of resource allocations in a dynamic environment where task execution times are stochastic. The methodology is evaluated through measuring the robustness of three different resource allocation heuristics within the context of a stochastic dynamic environment. A Bayesian regression model is fit to the combined results of the three heuristics to demonstrate the correlation between the stochastic robustness metric and the presented performance metric. The correlation results demonstrated the significant potential of the stochastic robustness metric to predict the relative performance of the three heuristics given a common objective function.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370315","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the Robustness of Resource Allocations in a Stochastic Dynamic Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the Robustness of Resource Allocations in a Stochastic Dynamic Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516711","htmlLink":"/document/4228043/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the Robustness of Resource Allocations in a Stochastic Dynamic Environment","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070003S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228057,"authors":[{"name":"Ankur Kamthe","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ankur Kamthe received his Bachelors degree in Electronics from Mumbai University, India in 2002.

In this paper, the problem of scheduling multiple, divisible independent tasks on a heterogeneous distributed computing system are addressed. The \"stochastic\" approach, which was previously applied to DAG scheduling, is employed for scheduling a group of multiple divisible as well as whole independent tasks. It explicitly considers the standard deviations (temporal heterogeneity) in addition to the mean execution times in deriving a schedule, in order to model more closely what would actually happen \"on average\" on a temporally heterogeneous system (instead of approximating the random weights by their means only as in other approaches). Through an extensive computer simulation, it has been shown that the proposed approach can improve schedules significantly over those by a scheme which uses the average weights only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228057/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228057/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9516522","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Approach to Scheduling Multiple Divisible Tasks on a Heterogeneous Distributed Computing System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Approach to Scheduling Multiple Divisible Tasks on a Heterogeneous Distributed Computing System","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.218942S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228073,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew W.

Preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can find schedules with small initiation intervals within a reasonable amount of time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370371","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370371","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modulo Scheduling Algorithm for a Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Array Template","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modulo Scheduling Algorithm for a Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Array Template","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516899","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228099/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modulo Scheduling Algorithm for a Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Array Template","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065406S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228101,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290439500"},{"name":"Xuezeng Pan","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Xuezeng","lastName":"Pan","id":"37280954300"},{"name":"Lingdi Ping","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lingdi","lastName":"Ping","id":"37279033500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228101","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"In the past a few years, wavelet transforms have become a hot topic of research. Discrete and continuous wavelet transforms have been widely used in signal and multimedia processing. Due to the high performance and flexibility of reconfigurable computing systems, it is very attractive to design a re configurable architecture for discrete and continuous wavelet transform of wide range of wavelet filters. In this paper, a unified computation framework for discrete and continuous wavelet transform based on lifting scheme and a reconfigurable architecture that includes reconfigurable lifting step arrays and reconfigurable address generator are proposed. The unified framework is the theory basis of this system. The step array is the computing core of this engine. And the address generator supports several memory scan pattern which is used to generate memory access addresses. In order to validate this architecture, an FPGA prototype is built based on Xilinx VirtexII FPGA to test the reconfiguration of 2-D discrete 5/3 and 9/7 transforms (defined in specification ofJPEG2000) and 2-D continuous Haar wavelet transform. Furthermore, a 3-level decomposition for a 512 times 512 grayscale image is performed and the results show that the decomposition can be finished within 12.16ms when running at 20MHz. It can be concluded that this design is applicable and scalable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228101.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Computing Engine for Wavelet Transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing","High performance computing","Filters","Reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","mathematics computing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable computing engine","discrete wavelet transform","continuous wavelet transform","signal processing","multimedia processing","reconfigurable architecture","reconfigurable lifting step array","Xilinx VirtexII FPGA","Haar wavelet transform","grayscale image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Computing Engine for Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516892","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Computing Engine for Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064248S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228105,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Phillips","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Phillips","id":"37655410200"},{"name":"Matthew Areno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Areno","id":"37689291900"},{"name":"Chris Rogers","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Rogers","id":"37698635600"},{"name":"Aravind Dasu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Aravind","lastName":"Dasu","id":"37326538600"},{"name":"Brandon Eames","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Eames","id":"37283548700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228105","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Acceleration","Computational modeling","Switches","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Runtime","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","molecular dynamics method","physics computing","reconfigurable architectures","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable load balancing architecture","molecular dynamics","FPGA","FLEX units","run-time performance analysis","dynamic resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel architecture supporting dynamic load balancing on an FPGA for a molecular dynamics algorithm.

These applications spend most of the execution time in the iteration of a few kernels; such kernels are typically made of independent operations, which can be executed in parallel. Clustered architectures are a solution designed to exploit the high instruction level parallelism (ILP) of the media kernels, to keep a good level of scalability and to match the strict constraints of the embedded domains. Within this category, architectures with reconfigurable connections between clusters are of particular interest. The enhanced flexibility allows them to handle several different data-paths effectively, hence multiple applications; this is a key economic factor in the semiconductor world, in which the cost of the masks significantly increases at every technological advance. This papers describes hierarchical cluster assignment (HCA), a compilation technique that deals with the problem of mapping the computation of multimedia kernels onto the clusters of the target machine. HCA exploits the hierarchical structure of the clusters of the target architectures; it works by decomposing the problem of cluster assignment into a sequence of simpler sub-problems, each of them involving a subset of the kernel instructions and a subset of the machine clusters. A prototype of this methodology has been implemented in a flexible framework and tested on machine models based on the DSPfabric architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228109.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Cluster Assignment for Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Coprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Kernel","Energy consumption","Silicon","Parallel processing","Scalability","Power generation economics","Costs","Computer architecture","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","embedded systems","multimedia computing","multiprocessor interconnection networks","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical cluster assignment","coarse-grain reconfigurable coprocessor","embedded system","instruction level parallelism","multimedia kernel","DSPfabric architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Cluster Assignment for Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Coprocessors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516893","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Cluster Assignment for Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Coprocessors","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059043S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228110,"authors":[{"name":"Sunil Shukla","affiliation":["Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia","Institut f\u00fcr Technik der Informationsverarbeitung (ITIV), Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Shukla","id":"37288611700"},{"name":"Neil W.

However, in most systems the reconfigurable coprocessor wastes computation cycles while waiting for the reconfiguration to complete. Therefore, the high demand for frequent run-time reconfiguration directly translates into higher reconfiguration overhead. Some studies have introduced the concept of prefetching to reduce the reconfiguration overhead. However, these prefetching algorithms are probability-driven. We believe that including configuration size information in the prediction algorithm directly links the training of the predictor with the performance gain. Therefore we proposed a performance-oriented cost-driven algorithm for coarse-grained configuration prefetching. Our cycle accurate simulation results show that the proposed cost-driven algorithm outperforms the probability-driven predictor by 10.8% to 29.6% in reducing reconfiguration overhead.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370384","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228112.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Driven Hybrid Configuration Prefetching for Partial Reconfigurable Coprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Driven Hybrid Configuration Prefetching for Partial Reconfigurable Coprocessor","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228112/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9517022","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228112/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Driven Hybrid Configuration Prefetching for Partial Reconfigurable Coprocessor","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04719S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228115,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Wang","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Hongzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599267600"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Delahaye","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Delahaye","id":"37408682600"},{"name":"Pierre Leray","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Leray","id":"37667093300"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228115","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"abstract":"This paper is about the implementation of a MIMO V-BLAST (vertical bell laboratories layered space-time) square root decoder in a FPGA using dynamic partial reconfiguration.

SQL attacks are those attacks that take advantage of using SQL statements to be performed. The problem of detection of this class of attacks is transformed to time series prediction problem. SQL queries are used as a source of events in a protected environment. To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence. All experiments were conducted on Jordan and Elman networks using data gathered from PHP Nuke portal. Experimental results show that the Jordan network outperforms the Elman network predicting correctly queries of the length up to ten.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370428","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228156.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent neural networks towards detection of SQL attacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Databases","Application software","Intrusion detection","Computer science","Testing","Information retrieval","Data security","Information security","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data integrity","recurrent neural nets","security of data","SQL","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","SQL attack detection","time series prediction problem","backpropagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent neural networks towards detection of SQL attacks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228156/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516781","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent neural networks towards detection of SQL attacks","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065323S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4228161,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Camara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture and Technology, ETSIIT, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Camara","id":"37700567500"},{"name":"Julio Ortega","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture and Technology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Ortega","id":"37275699700"},{"name":"Francisco J.

These dynamic optimization problems appear in quite different real-world applications with relevant socio-economic impact. The procedure in this paper is presented based on PSFGA, a parallel evolutionary procedure for multi-objective optimization. It uses a master process that distributes the population among the processors in the system (that evolve their corresponding solutions according to an island model), and collects and adjusts the set of local Pareto fronts found by each processor (this way, the master also allows an implicit communication among islands). Moreover, the procedure exclusively uses non-dominated individuals for the selection and variation, and maintains the diversity of the approximation to the Pareto front by using a strategy based on a crowding distance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228161/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9516786","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228161/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel Processing for Multi-objective Optimization in Dynamic Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Processing for Multi-objective Optimization in Dynamic Environments","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056203S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":4228162,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Cui","affiliation":["Applied Software Engineering Research, Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085420138"},{"name":"Thomas E.

In PSO algorithm, the problem solution emerges from the interactions among many simple individual agents called particles. In the real world, we have to frequently deal with searching and tracking an optimal solution in a dynamical and noisy environment. This demands that the algorithm not only find the optimal solution but also track the trajectory of the non-stationary solution. The traditional PSO algorithm lacks the ability to track the changing optimal solution in a dynamic and noisy environment. In this paper, we present a distributed adaptive PSO (DAPSO) algorithm that can be used to track a non-stationary optimal solution in a dynamically changing and noisy environment.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370434","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228162.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimizer in Dynamic Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Working environment noise","Trajectory","Heuristic algorithms","Birds","Equations","Software engineering","Distributed computing","Stochastic processes","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","stochastic processes","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population-based stochastic optimization","search problem","noisy environment","trajectory tracking","nonstationary optimal solution","distributed adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm","dynamic environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimizer in Dynamic Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516771","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimizer in Dynamic Environment","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08656S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4228166,"authors":[{"name":"Azzedine Boukerche","affiliation":["SITE, University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Azzedine","lastName":"Boukerche","id":"37279514400"},{"name":"Jan M.

This article presents the design and evaluation of an FPGA-based architecture that obtains the similarity score between DNA sequences, as well as its coordinates. The results obtained in a Xilinx xc2vp70 FPGA prototype presented a speedup of 246.9 over the software solution to compare sequences of size 100 MBP and 100 BP, respectively.

The random search method was constructed in order to offer a lower bound for the comparison. Furthermore, a conjugated gradient local search method is employed for each of the algorithms, at different points on the execution path. The algorithms are evaluated using the protein structure prediction problem, the benchmark instances consisting of the tryptophan-cage protein (Brookhaven protein data bank ID 1L2Y) and alpha-cyclodextrin. The algorithms are designed to benefit from the grid environment although having no particular optimization for the specified benchmarks. The presented results are obtained by running the algorithms independently and, in a second time, in conjunction with the conjugated gradient search method. Experimentations were performed on a nation-wide grid reuniting five distinct administrative domains and cumulating 400 CPUs. The complexity of the protein structure prediction problem remains prohibitive as far as large proteins are concerned, making the use of parallel computing on the computational grid essential for its efficient resolution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Parallel Metaheuristics for Protein Structure Prediction on the Computational Grid","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370439","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228167.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Parallel Metaheuristics for Protein Structure Prediction on the Computational Grid","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228167/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Parallel Metaheuristics for Protein Structure Prediction on the Computational Grid","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078185S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4228175,"authors":[{"name":"Arpith C.

One of its limitations is that an enormous computational effort is required to simulate to realistic time spans. Conventional parallelization strategies have limited effectiveness in dealing with this difficulty. We recently introduced a more scalable approach to parallelization, where data from prior, related, simulations are used to parallelize a simulation in the time domain. We demonstrated its effectiveness in nano-mechanics simulations. In this paper, we develop our approach so that it can be used in a soft-matter application involving the atomic force microscopy simulation of proteins. We obtain an order of magnitude improvement in performance when we combine time parallelization with conventional parallelization. The significance of this work lies in demonstrating the promise of data-driven time parallelization in soft-matter applications, which are more challenging than the hard-matter applications considered earlier.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Biology computing","Atomic force microscopy","Computer simulation","Chemistry","Nanobioscience","Protein engineering","Biological system modeling","Computational biology","Solvents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","biological techniques","biology computing","digital simulation","molecular biophysics","parallel processing","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven time-parallelization","AFM simulation","proteins","molecular dynamics","nano-mechanics simulation","atomic force microscopy simulation","soft-matter applications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370450","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228178.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Time-Parallelization in the AFM Simulation of Proteins","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Time-Parallelization in the AFM Simulation of Proteins","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228178/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228178/","accessionNumber":"9516538","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Time-Parallelization in the AFM Simulation of Proteins","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093287S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228210,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These machines use commodity PCs linked by a high speed interconnect. Routing is one of the most important design issues of interconnection networks. Adaptive routing usually better balances network traffic, thus allowing the network to obtain a higher throughput. However, adaptive routing introduces out-of-order packet delivery, which is unacceptable for some applications. Concerning topology, most of the commercially available interconnects are based on fat-tree. Fat-trees offer a rich connectivity among nodes, making possible to obtain paths between all source-destination pairs that do not share any link. We exploit this idea to propose a deterministic routing algorithm for fat-trees, comparing it with adaptive routing in several workloads. The results show that deterministic routing can achieve a similar, and in some scenarios higher, level of performance than adaptive routing, while providing in-order packet delivery.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370482","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228210.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic versus Adaptive Routing in Fat-Trees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic versus Adaptive Routing in Fat-Trees","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228210/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516533","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic versus Adaptive Routing in Fat-Trees","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069551S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228227,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Li","id":"37406888700"},{"name":"Maria Jesus Garzaran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Maria Jesus","lastName":"Garzaran","id":"37326519600"},{"name":"David Padua","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Padua","id":"37282646500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228227","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Machine learning algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Libraries","Spirals","Character generation","Power generation","Tiles","Genetic algorithms","Optimizing compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimising compilers","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting routines opimization","machine learning algorithms","automatic code generation strategy","library generators","genetic algorithms","classifier system","IBM ESSL library","INTEL MKL library","C++ STL library"]}],"abstract":"The growing complexity of modern processors has made the development of highly efficient code increasingly difficult. A promising automatic code generation strategy is implemented by library generators. This approach has mainly been applied to scientific codes which can be optimized by identifying code characteristics that depend only on the target machine. In this paper, we study the generation of sorting routines whose performance also depends on the characteristics of the input data. We present two approaches to generate efficient sorting routines. First, we consider the problem of selecting the best \"pure\" sorting algorithm as a function of the characteristics of the input data. We used machine learning algorithms to compute a function for each target machine that, at runtime, is used to select the best algorithm. Our second approach generalizes the first approach and can build new sorting algorithms from a few primitive operations. We use genetic algorithms and a classifier system to build hierarchically-organized hybrid sorting algorithms. Our results show that the algorithms generated using this second approach are quite effective and perform significantly better than the many conventional sorting implementations we tested. In particular, the routines generated using the second approach performs better than the most popular libraries available today: IBM ESSL, INTEL MKL and the C+ + STL.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228227.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Sorting with Machine Learning Algorithms","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Sorting with Machine Learning Algorithms","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516810","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228227/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Sorting with Machine Learning Algorithms","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040888S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228288,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Olivier","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Olivier","id":"37687622800"},{"name":"Jan Prins","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Prins","id":"37347959800"},{"name":"Jeff Derby","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Derby","id":"38305781800"},{"name":"Ken Vu","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Vu","id":"37692657300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228288","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Application software","Computer architecture","Acceleration","Computer applications","Sparse matrices","Registers","Computer science","Packaging","Isolation technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemistry computing","computer architecture","molecular dynamics method","optimising compilers","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cell processor","Cell architecture","GROMACS molecular dynamics package","optimizing compiler"]}],"abstract":"The Cell processor offers substantial computational power which can be effectively utilized only if application design and implementation are tuned to the Cell architecture.

In this paper, we report an in-depth study on such challenges based on our experience of optimizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the IBM Cyclops-64 chip architecture - a large-scale multi-core chip architecture consisting 160 thread units, associated memory banks and an interconnection network that connect them together in a shared memory organization. We demonstrate how multi-core architectures like the C64 could be used to achieve a high performance implementation of FFT both in 1D and 2D cases. We analyze the optimization challenges and opportunities including problem decomposition, load balancing, work distribution, and data-reuse, together with the exploiting of the C64 architecture features such as the multi-level of memory hierarchy and large register files. Furthermore, the experience learned during the hand-tuned optimization process have provided valuable guidance in our compiler optimization design and implementation. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) our study demonstrates that successful optimization for C64-like large-scale multi-core architectures requires a careful analysis that can identify certain domain-specific features of a target application (e.g. FFT) and match them well with some key multi-core architecture features; 2) our optimization, assisted with hand-tuned process, provided quantitative evidence on the importance of each optimization identified in 1); 3) automatic optimization by our compiler, the design and implementation of which is guided by the feedbacks from 1) and 2), shows excellent results that are often comparable to the results derived from our time-consuming hand-tuned code.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4203121/4227918/04228367.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the Fast Fourier Transform on a Multi-core Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Computer architecture","Design optimization","Optimizing compilers","Large-scale systems","Microprocessor chips","Multicore processing","Application software","System software","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","fast Fourier transforms","mathematics computing","microprocessor chips","optimising compilers","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform optimization","multicore microprocessor chip architecture","IBM Cyclops-64 multicore chip architecture","shared memory organization","memory hierarchy","compiler automatic optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Fast Fourier Transform on a Multi-core Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9516876","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Fast Fourier Transform on a Multi-core Architecture","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPDPS-00-449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057539S","chronDate":"26-30 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4203121","isNumber":"4227918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4203121","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4227918","articleId":"4228367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4228412,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Dubois","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Dubois","id":"37276811900"},{"name":"Hyunyoung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Hyunyoung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280121700"},{"name":"Lan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37559264100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0909-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0910-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"4228412","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Clocks","Yarn","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS technology","Parallel processing","Parallel algorithms","Frequency","USA Councils","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STAMP","universal algorithmic model","multithreaded machine","generic algorithmic model","power complexity model","chip multiprocessor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228412","abstract":"We propose a generic algorithmic model called STAMP(synchronous, transactional, and asynchronous multi-processing) as a universal performance and power complexity model for multithreaded algorithms and systems.

This innovative geometry enables the fabrication of highly reliable memory devices with improved sensing signal. In order to target space applications, it is of primary interest to analyze the effects of ionizing radiations (x-rays, X-rays...) on capacitors integrated in advanced memory architectures. In this paper, effects of x-rays combined with either bias voltage or bipolar electrical cycling were analyzed on 3D ferroelectric capacitor memory-like arrays. Using an experimental setup enabling measurements under radiations, these arrays were submitted to electrical stresses simulating the various states of the memory. For memory-like arrays in \"written\" state (no applied bias), high dose of X-rays accelerates both fatigue-like (polarization reduction) and imprint-like (voltage shift) phenomena, which may subsequently alter normal memory operations. Nevertheless, it has been shown that repeated cycling makes the degradation mechanisms reversible. Alternatively, for memory-like arrays in \"writing\" state, two distinct simulated conditions have been considered. If irradiated capacitors are always being written in the same state, huge and irreversible imprint-like effect may cause memory cell \"read\" or \"write\" failures. Moreover, if capacitors are cycled in normal conditions (i e. bipolar pulses), the strong acceleration of fatigue mechanism may cause \"read\" failures since the two remnant states may be indistinguishable during memory reading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of three-dimensional ferroelectric capacitor memory-like arrays simultaneously submitted to x-rays and electrical stresses","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.2006.378873","startPage":"40","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMT.2006.378873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228419","publicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228418/4228419/04228432.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of three-dimensional ferroelectric capacitor memory-like arrays simultaneously submitted to x-rays and electrical stresses","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228432/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10289567","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of three-dimensional ferroelectric capacitor memory-like arrays simultaneously submitted to x-rays and electrical stresses","confLoc":"San Mateo, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NVMT-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073616S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4228418","isNumber":"4228419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228418","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4228419","articleId":"4228432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4228433,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The top-down design focused on accommodating chalcogenide process variations and satisfying space system specifications. The optimized band-gap circuit supplies reference current and voltage that meet temperature and voltage requirements. The innovative write circuitry supplies appropriate currents (amplitude and shape) to the chalcogenide memory cells to allow them to be programmed either in amorphous state (write \"0\") or crystalline state (write \"1\"). The on-chip pulse generator circuit can provide multiple pulse widths for write \"0\" and write \"1\". The write circuits have a dedicated power supply, which can be removed to place the part in a read only mode. The read circuitry includes a voltage limiting circuit, an adjustable current reference, an adjustable pre-charge circuit, and a sense amplifier to accurately sense the current difference between cells programmed as \"0\" or \"1\". A localized, redundant cell architecture is implemented with shared read/write circuits to improve yield without impacting access times. The redundant cells can be tested prior to laser fusing or used to monitor endurance. Considerations for testability such as direct chalcogenide cell access, margin testing, analog monitors, and endurance acceleration have been implemented. Noise and power reduction techniques have also been used globally.","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.2006.378879","publicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228418/4228419/04228438.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMT.2006.378879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4-Mbit Non-Volatile Chalcogenide-Random Access Memory Designed for Space Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A 4-Mbit Non-Volatile Chalcogenide-Random Access Memory Designed for Space Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10289573","htmlLink":"/document/4228438/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-Mbit Non-Volatile Chalcogenide-Random Access Memory Designed for Space Applications","confLoc":"San Mateo, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NVMT-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091113S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4228418","isNumber":"4228419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228418","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4228419","articleId":"4228438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4228439,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

In most cases, polycrystalline oxide films are deposited by reactive sputtering on conductive substrates to form bi-stable Metal/Resistive oxide/Metal (MRM) structures. In this paper, an alternative way is explored to obtain NiO films from the controlled oxidation of a Ni metallic film. Different thermal treatments were evaluated to oxidize the metallic film with conditions preventing the complete consumption of Ni film used as bottom electrode. Process parameters of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) route were adjusted to achieve controlled oxidation. Microstructural and electrical analyzes were performed to apprehend the influence of the process parameters on the switching behavior.

In this paper we will show and discuss examples of electrodeposition within ternary silver-chalcogenide electrolyte device structures. The electrolyte was sectioned using focused ion beam milling and imaged with an in-situ scanning electron microscope to reveal the profile of the structure. A variety of Ag electrodeposits were imaged in overwritten devices and it was clear that programming times in the order of a few seconds will create multiple deposits on the inert cathode, some of which appear to extend through to the anode. The electron beam itself was also used to reduce silver ions within the electrolyte to reveal how the electrodeposits might nucleate on the Ag-rich phases within the film.","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.2006.378888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMT.2006.378888","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 7th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228418/4228419/04228447.pdf","startPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrodeposit Formation in Solid Electrolytes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228447/","displayDocTitle":"Electrodeposit Formation in Solid Electrolytes","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"10289582","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228447/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrodeposit Formation in Solid Electrolytes","confLoc":"San Mateo, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"NVMT-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052927S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4228418","isNumber":"4228419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228418","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4228419","articleId":"4228447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4228460,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Hobbs","affiliation":["3M Company, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Hobbs"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1479-8344"}],"articleNumber":"4228460","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IET","url":"http://www.theiet.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228460","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["government policies","railway electrification","rapid transit systems","standards","traction power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rail electrification","EU directives","trans-European high speed rail system interoperability","European Union","25 kV"]}],"doi":"10.1049/pe:20070204","publicationTitle":"Power Engineer","displayPublicationTitle":"Power Engineer","pdfPath":"/iel5/8455/4227149/04228460.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/pe:20070204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4227149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed power","abstract":"This paper presents the need for compatibility between European rail networks.

Important issues in MPSoC design are the communication infrastructure and task mapping. MPSoCs may employ NoCs to integrate multiple programmable processor cores, specialized memories, and other IPs in a scalable way. Applications running in MPSoCs execute a varying number of tasks simultaneously, and their number may exceed the available resources, requiring task mapping to be executed at runtime to meet real-time constraints. Most works in the literature present static MPSoC mapping solutions. Static mapping defines a fixed placement and scheduling, not appropriate for dynamic workloads. Task migration has also been proposed for use in MPSoCs, with the goal to relocate tasks when performance bottlenecks are identified. This work investigates the performance of mapping heuristics in NoC-based MPSoCs with dynamic workloads, targeting NoC congestion minimization, a key cost function to optimize the NoC performance. Here, tasks are mapped on the fly, according to communication requests and the load in the NoC links. Results show execution time and congestion reduction when congestion-aware mapping heuristics are employed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Energy consumption","Power system modeling","Runtime","Cost function","Multiprocessing systems","Very large scale integration","Hardware","Streaming media","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","logic design","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic task mapping","NoC-based heterogeneous","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","VLSI design","multiple programmable processor core","congestion-aware mapping","dynamic workload"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RSP.2007.26","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228468/4228469/04228482.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2007.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristics for Dynamic Task Mapping in NoC-based Heterogeneous MPSoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heuristics for Dynamic Task Mapping in NoC-based Heterogeneous MPSoCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228482/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228482/","accessionNumber":"9863872","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristics for Dynamic Task Mapping in NoC-based Heterogeneous MPSoCs","confLoc":"Porto alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28340034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038654S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4228468","isNumber":"4228469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228468","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4228469","articleId":"4228482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4228503,"authors":[{"name":"Vagner S.

All modules designed were completely described in VHDL and further validated through simulations. The post place-and-route synthesis results indicate that the designed architectures are able to target real time when processing HDTV 1080p frames (1080times1920). The architectures were prototyped using a Digilent XUP V2P board, containing a Virtex-II Pro XC2VP30 Xilinx FPGA. The prototyping strategy used an embedded Power PC and associated logic and buffering to control the modules under prototyping. A host computer, running the reference software, was used to generate the input stimuli and to compare the results, through a RS-232 serial interface.","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228468/4228469/04228503.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2007.23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2007.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Prototyping Strategy for a H.264/AVC Video Decoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Automatic voltage control","Decoding","Video compression","Software prototyping","Filters","Hardware","Digital TV","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","high definition television","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA prototyping strategy","H.264/AVC video decoder","VHDL","RS-232 serial interface","1080p HDTV resolution","Virtex-II Pro XC2VP30 Xilinx FPGA","Digilent XUP V2P board"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Prototyping Strategy for a H.264/AVC Video Decoder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9863893","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Prototyping Strategy for a H.264/AVC Video Decoder","confLoc":"Porto alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28340174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066259S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4228468","isNumber":"4228469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228468","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4228469","articleId":"4228503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4228507,"authors":[{"name":"Chanik Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chanik","lastName":"Park","id":"37277788400"},{"name":"Wonmoon Cheon","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonmoon","lastName":"Cheon","id":"37689546100"},{"name":"Yangsup Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yangsup","lastName":"Lee","id":"37697224900"},{"name":"Myoung-Soo Jung","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myoung-Soo","lastName":"Jung","id":"38182734600"},{"name":"Wonhee Cho","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonhee","lastName":"Cho","id":"37686901000"},{"name":"Hanbin Yoon","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanbin","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37695818800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2834-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"4228507","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":550},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Re-configurable FTL (Flash Translation Layer) Architecture for NAND Flash based Applications","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel FTL (flash translation layer) architecture for NAND flash based applications such as mp3 players, DSCs (Digital still camera) and SSDs (Solid-state disk).

After we categorize dominant parameters that affect performance and endurance, we explore the design space of the FTL architecture based on a diverse workload analysis. With our FTL architectural framework, we can decide which configuration of FTL mapping parameters yields the best performance depending on each NAND flash application behavior.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Application software","Flash memory","Embedded system","Space exploration","Operating systems","Software architecture","Cellular phones","Personal digital assistants","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable FTL architecture","flash translation layer","NAND flash","flash memory","diverse workload analysis","FTL mapping parameters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228507","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2007.8","startPage":"202","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228468/4228469/04228507.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2007.8","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228507/","displayDocTitle":"A Re-configurable FTL (Flash Translation Layer) Architecture for NAND Flash based Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9863897","htmlLink":"/document/4228507/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Re-configurable FTL (Flash Translation Layer) Architecture for NAND Flash based Applications","confLoc":"Porto alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28340202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049335S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4228468","isNumber":"4228469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228468","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4228469","articleId":"4228507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4228536,"authors":[{"name":"Junaed Sattar","affiliation":["Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Junaed","lastName":"Sattar","id":"37546394500"},{"name":"Eric Bourque","affiliation":["DIRO, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Bourque","id":"37698571200"},{"name":"Philippe Giguere","affiliation":["Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Giguere","id":"37560636500"},{"name":"Gregory Dudek","affiliation":["Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Dudek","id":"37274057100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2786-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4228536","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228536","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Robot vision systems","Robot kinematics","Computer science","Cameras","Computer vision","Encoding","Noise robustness","Underwater tracking","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bar codes","Fourier transforms","identification technology","image coding","image resolution","man-machine systems","robot vision","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier tags","degradable fiducial markers","human-robot interaction","information encoding","position control","bar-code","effective resolution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we introduce the Fourier tag, a synthetic fiducial marker used to visually encode information and provide controllable positioning. The Fourier tag is a synthetic target akin to a bar-code that specifies multi-bit information which can be efficiently and robustly detected in an image. Moreover, the Fourier tag has the beneficial property that the bit string it encodes has variable length as a function of the distance between the camera and the target. This follows from the fact that the effective resolution decreases as an effect of perspective.

On the other hand, fast marching methods (FMM) are SfS algorithms that use the mechanism of wave propagation to reconstruct the surface. In this paper, the estimation of lighting direction is addressed and we model it as an optimization problem. The idea is to minimize the inconsistency of wave propagation of FMM during the reconstruction. As the consistency of wave propagation is a multi-modal function, genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to determine the lighting direction. Experimental results on four oblique SfSs with an unknown lighting direction are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2007.43","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228509/4228510/04228551.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"296","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV '07)","publicationTitle":"Fourth Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV '07)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2007.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lighting Direction Estimation in Perspective Shape from Shading by Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Lighting Direction Estimation in Perspective Shape from Shading by Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9834220","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4228551/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lighting Direction Estimation in Perspective Shape from Shading by Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"27860289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055608S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4228509","isNumber":"4228510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4228510","articleId":"4228551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4228562,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Perreault","affiliation":["Centre de MOIVRE, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Perreault","id":"38270064100"},{"name":"Marie-Flavie Auclair-Fortier","affiliation":["Centre de MOIVRE, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Marie-Flavie","lastName":"Auclair-Fortier","id":"38325891300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2786-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4228562","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Medical simulation","Ultrasonic imaging","Pixel","Biomedical imaging","Geometry","Solid modeling","Quantization","Image sampling","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","geometry","image sampling","medical image processing","random processes","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["B-mode echographic image acquisition model","B-mode medical ultrasound speckle simulation","synthetic images","ultrasound image formation model","ideal noiseless image geometry","sectoral B-mode ultrasonogram matching","pixel grid subsampling","quantization steps","random walk","Burckhardt speckle formation model","complete image recovery"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel method to simulate B-mode medical ultrasound speckle in synthetic images. Our approach takes into account both the ultrasound image formation model and the speckle formation model. The algorithm first modifies the geometry of an ideal noiseless image to match that of a sectoral B-mode ultrasonogram, by subsampling a grid of pixels to simulate the acquisition and quantization steps of image formation. Then, speckle is added by simulating a random walk in the plane of the complex amplitude, according to the Burckhardt speckle formation model. We finally interpolate the noisy subsampled pixels in order to fill the space introduced by the sampling step and recover a complete image, as would a real ultrasonograph. Synthetic speckle images generated by this method are visually and theoretically very close to real ultrasonograms.","doi":"10.1109/CRV.2007.61","publicationTitle":"Fourth Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4228509/4228510/04228562.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2007.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4228510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speckle Simulation Based on B-Mode Echographic Image Acquisition Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4228562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4228562/","displayDocTitle":"Speckle Simulation Based on B-Mode Echographic Image Acquisition Model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9834221","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4228562/","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle Simulation Based on B-Mode Echographic Image Acquisition Model","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"27860379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045559S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4228509","isNumber":"4228510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4228509","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4228510","articleId":"4228562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4228667,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Linstead","affiliation":["Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Linstead","id":"37318380700"},{"name":"Paul Rigor","affiliation":["Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Rigor","id":"37689575800"},{"name":"Sushil Bajracharya","affiliation":["Institute for Software Research, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Sushil","lastName":"Bajracharya","id":"37314241200"},{"name":"Cristina Lopes","affiliation":["Institute for Software Research, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Lopes","id":"37267686000"},{"name":"Pierre Baldi","affiliation":["Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37267684000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2950-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1852"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1860"}],"articleNumber":"4228667","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Java","Bioinformatics","Open source software","Linear discriminant analysis","Genomics","Availability","Mining industry","Text mining","Information retrieval","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data warehouses","Java","project management","software development management","software tools","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Eclipse developer contribution mining","statistical author-topic models","Eclipse 3.0 source code","open source software repositories","Java projects"]}],"abstract":"We present the results of applying statistical author-topic models to a subset of the Eclipse 3.0 source code consisting of 2,119 source files and 700,000 lines of code from 59 developers.
