The goal of using external camera is to test, how it can aid the head camera of robot when the object moves out of its field of view. The setup of system is focused on comparison of robot with and without additional camera. The tracked object is a simple pink ball and the tracking mechanism is a simple multilayer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. The mechanism of tracking is not to shift the coordinates of moving object on fixed scene, but actually to turn the head of robot to have the object in the center of scene, like with a human tracking some object. In the paper we provide details of setup of working system, with results and parameters, which can be used as a starting point for similar experiments. Actually, the training set construction is important for this type of robotic tracking, please see details in the paper. The system is working. We believe, it is easy to repeat our results, and the effect of added camera can be demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/INCoS.2016.45","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7685688/7695003/07695153.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INCoS.2016.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Ball Tracking for Robot Nao","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Cameras","Training","Robot vision systems","Head","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cameras","multilayer perceptrons","object tracking","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based ball tracking","robot Nao","robot head movement","robot head camera","object tracking mechanism","multilayer perceptron","backpropagation","human tracking","robotic tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Ball Tracking for Robot Nao","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695153/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413507","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Ball Tracking for Robot Nao","confLoc":"Ostrava, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"4124a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070466S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7685688","isNumber":"7695003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7685688","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695003","articleId":"7695153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695166,"authors":[{"name":"Lijie Wang","affiliation":["Xi'an Satellite Control Center, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lijie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085891728"},{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["Xi'an Satellite Control Center, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37595822400"},{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Xi'an Satellite Control Center, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085893133"},{"name":"Dangfeng Zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology, Information System Security, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dangfeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085893910"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4124-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4125-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695166","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transmitters","Cognitive radio","Encoding","Resource management","Computational modeling","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","encoding","game theory","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","multiple cooperative relays","stackelberg game","DSTC","spectrum utility","cooperative communication technology","secondary users","cooperative cognitive radio network","space-time coding relay scheme","relay selection problem","spectrum allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative cognitive radio network","Distributed space-time coding","Spectrum utility","Spectrum allocation","Relay selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695166","doi":"10.1109/INCoS.2016.69","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS)","abstract":"The spectrum utility can be improved when cooperative communication technology is incorporated into cognitive radio network, and both the licensed users and secondary users can benefit from cooperating.

Considering the primary user owns the spectrum and both the primary user and secondary users are selfish and reasonable, this cooperative cognitive network is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Based on utility maximizing, this paper studies the spectrum allocation and relay selection problem. A spectrum allocation algorithm is derived under given number of secondary users, and a low complexity relay selection strategy is proposed to maximize the utility of the primary user while guaranteeing the data rate of the primary user and the fairness among the secondary users.

As one significant component of the Image Processing, Image fusion is widely employed in many aspects, such as medical diagnose, military reconnaissance and remote sensing survey. To get a fused image which combines the target information and features of infrared and visible light image, a fusion method based on the Non-subsample Shearlet Transform (NSST) and heat source concentration ratio is presented in this paper. Compared with the traditional contourlet transform, NSST can overcome the limitation in directional decomposition and has excellent shift invariance. The input is decomposed to two parts by the transform, a new fusion rule which adopts the heat source concentration ratio and space frequency to retain as more important information as possible is presented in the low-frequency part and information entropy serves as the measurement in the high-frequent part. Simulation shows that the new fusion scheme can obviously improve the quality of fusion image and makes the heat source information prominent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695237/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413492","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Infrared and Visible Light Image Fusion Based on the Non-subsample Shearlet Transform and Heat Source Concentration Ratio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Infrared and Visible Light Image Fusion Based on the Non-subsample Shearlet Transform and Heat Source Concentration Ratio","confLoc":"Ostrava, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"4124a544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138218S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7685688","isNumber":"7695003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7685688","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695003","articleId":"7695237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7695254,"authors":[{"name":"Sidney Gierschner","affiliation":["UNIVERSITY OF ROSTOCK, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Sidney","lastName":"Gierschner","id":"37077445300"},{"name":"Jan Fuhrmann","affiliation":["UNIVERSITY OF ROSTOCK, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Fuhrmann","id":"37085433014"},{"name":"Patrick M\u00fcnster","affiliation":["UNIVERSITY OF ROSTOCK, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"M\u00fcnster","id":"37085888476"},{"name":"David Hammes","affiliation":["UNIVERSITY OF ROSTOCK, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hammes","id":"37085896663"},{"name":"Hans-G\u00fcnter Eckel","affiliation":["UNIVERSITY OF ROSTOCK, Rostock, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-G\u00fcnter","lastName":"Eckel","id":"37270773300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1524-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1410-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695254","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Semiconductor diodes","Current measurement","Logic gates","Voltage measurement","Plasmas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-direction detection","static MOS-control","BIGT on-state characteristics","three-level neutral-point-clamped converter","gate-emitter voltage","diode forward-conduction mode","antiparallel free-wheeling diode","threshold voltage","low static losses","optimised gate control","three-phase three-level converter","bi-mode insulated-gate transistor","voltage 15 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel converters","Voltage Source Converter (VSC)","Power semiconductor device","Converter control","Conduction losses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695254","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695254.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-direction detection for static MOS-control of the BIGT in the three-level neutral-point-clamped converter","abstract":"The gate-emitter voltage V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GE</sub>\n affects the on-state characteristics of the BIGT in diode forward-conduction mode.

In such applications, the classical sorting algorithms are based on repetitive/recursive loops, and they are usually implemented in microcontrollers or DSPs. However, they are not convenient for hardware implementation due to their inherent sequential operation. Instead, the proposed SNs, are suitable for FPGA devices thanks to their fixed parallel structure that allows improving the timing performance of the capacitor voltage balancing algorithm. The advantages and the main challenges of the Bitonic SN and Even-Odd SN in MMC applications are discussed. Moreover, in order to pre-evaluate the required resources and the execution time, equations are derived for both the proposed SNs and then a comparison is performed between them. The proposed equations are validated by comparing the real required resources with the estimated ones by using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite tool. Finally, the operation of the proposed Bitonic SN is also tested in Vivado Simulator, achieving the sorted list of 8 elements in 18 clock cycles as expected.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695280","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of sorting networks in MMC applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of sorting networks in MMC applications","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16412821","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based implementation of sorting networks in MMC applications","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0037epe2016full16243570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093177S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7695354,"authors":[{"name":"Alber Filba-Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alber","lastName":"Filba-Martinez","id":"37085639844"},{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Busquets-Monge","id":"37265964100"},{"name":"Josep Bordonau","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Bordonau","id":"37275460700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1524-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1410-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695354","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":303},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zirconium","Erbium","Density estimation robust algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor voltage balancing control","four-level active-clamped dual-active-bridge DC-DC converter","four-level active-clamped legs","modulation pattern","dc-link capacitor voltage balancing","steady state response","transient response","dSPACE control platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel converters","DC power supply","Transformer","Modulation strategy","Converter control"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes and demonstrates the feasibility of a dual-active-bridge converter built upon four-level active-clamped legs.

LCL-filter creates several resonances in the converter dynamics which shall be damped for ensuring robust performance of the converter. The resonant behavior introduced by the LCL-filter can be attenuated with active damping (AD) instead of passive damping to improve the conversion efficiency. The active damping affects the output impedance of the converter, and the impedance should be accurately predicted in order to allow analyzing impedance-based stability of power electronics-based power systems. This paper presents the small-signal model for inverter-current-feedback (ICF) converter using only the inverter-side inductor current feedback for both control and active damping. Additionally, the output impedance properties are comprehensively analyzed. Experimental measurements from 3-kW prototype are presented to verify the analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695360","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695360.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of single-current-feedback active damping on the output impedance of grid-connected inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Effect of single-current-feedback active damping on the output impedance of grid-connected inverter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695360/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16412899","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of single-current-feedback active damping on the output impedance of grid-connected inverter","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0164epe2016full11231844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06596S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7695365,"authors":[{"name":"M.

LCL filter resonance behaviour and the uncertainty of the grid impedance value which may lead to instability problems. In this context, a robust active damping control for LCL filtered grid connected inverter under grid inductance variation is proposed in this paper. The two useful methodologies, Lyapunov stability theory and LMI approach, are adopted to design robust observer-based control for this class of uncertain systems. The simulations results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this control. A comparison study of the results derived in this work with previous observer based active damping method shows the superiority of the proposed design strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695376/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16412765","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust observer based active damping control for LCL filtered grid connected converters using LMI criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust observer based active damping control for LCL filtered grid connected converters using LMI criterion","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0188epe2016full14471420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043888S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7695379,"authors":[{"name":"Masafumi Otsuka","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37085821052"},{"name":"K.

The SCB must therefore generate its own internal supply from the small AC voltage drop across the main switch when the breaker is closed. The SCB is composed of the following key blocks: 1) back-to-back 900 V Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs as the main power switches, 2) a low-voltage energy harvesting circuit, 3) a high-voltage step-down converter, and 4) low-power digital controller and wireless communication circuits. In order to stabilize the internal supply voltage under a wide range of AC load currents, a novel approach of dynamic on-resistance control is implemented, through adaptive gate-drive and MOSFET segmentation.

The V/f control does not require either information of a rotor position or the motor parameters in order to construct the control system. However, the conventional MTPA control requires the motor parameters because the control determines the compensation voltage depending on the reactive power. On the other hand, with the proposed MTPA control, a hill climbing method is utilized. The proposed MTPA control calculates the compensation voltage depending on the output current in order to track the MTPA control point without the motor parameters. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by the experimental results using a 3.7-kW IPMSM. From the experimental results, the magnitude of the phase current is decreased by 56% at the rated speed. Furthermore, the proposed MTPA control is effective regardless of the magnitude of the load torque.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695442/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16412832","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximum torque per ampere control using hill climbing method without motor parameters based on V/f control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum torque per ampere control using hill climbing method without motor parameters based on V/f control","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0283epe2016full13202221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049632S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7695515,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Haidian district, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291967400"},{"name":"Lie Xu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Haidian district, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lie","lastName":"Xu","id":"38025014200"},{"name":"Zedong Zheng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Haidian district, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zedong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538780100"},{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Haidian district, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37595292500"},{"name":"Yongdong Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Haidian district, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279894000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1524-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1410-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695515","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Rectifiers","Power system stability","Pulse width modulation","Impedance","Stability analysis","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","damping","electric vehicles","PWM rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping based stability improvement methods","more electric aircraft","source-side PWM rectifier","MEA","load-side active damping methods","load performance","damping capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping","Stability","More electric aircraft","Sensitivity","LC filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695515","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping based stability improvement methods on source side for more electric aircraft","abstract":"This paper proposed four stability improvement methods by source-side PWM rectifier for More Electric Aircrafts (MEAs).

It replaces the traditional electromechanical circuit breakers, contactors and relays to switch loads on/off and provides comprehensive protection functions. The large surge current, which results from the starting of large capacitive loads, is similar to the short-circuit fault, so it may mislead to the false protection and on the other hand, destroy the solid-state switch MOSFET. This paper proposes a control strategy for DC-SSPC, which can not only limit spikes but also distinguish short-circuit fault from capacitive loads quickly. Simulations and experiments proves that the control strategy is feasible. And compared with the fixed time delay fault detection strategy, the newly proposed control strategy can decrease the distinguish time, increase the capacity of switching on large capacitive loads.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695558","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695558.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A switching-on control strategy of the DC-SSPC for the capacitive loads","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413037","htmlLink":"/document/7695558/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A switching-on control strategy of the DC-SSPC for the capacitive loads","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0452epe2016full18174144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065304S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695586,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Finally, several points of operation will be used to evaluate the strategies for long term use.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695595","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695595.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency comparison of active and passive grid filter damping methods using direct matrix converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency comparison of active and passive grid filter damping methods using direct matrix converter","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695595/","accessionNumber":"16412871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695595/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency comparison of active and passive grid filter damping methods using direct matrix converter","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0506epe2016full16524088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056586S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7695596,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Oelkers","affiliation":["INSTITUTE FOR DRIVE SYSTEMS AND POWER ELECTRONICS LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAT HANNOVER, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Oelkers","id":"37085641994"},{"name":"Bastian Weber","affiliation":["INSTITUTE FOR DRIVE SYSTEMS AND POWER ELECTRONICS LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAT HANNOVER, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Bastian","lastName":"Weber","id":"37085404548"},{"name":"Axel Mertens","affiliation":["INSTITUTE FOR DRIVE SYSTEMS AND POWER ELECTRONICS LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITAT HANNOVER, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Mertens","id":"37297781600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1524-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1410-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695596","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel method for detecting open circuit faults in electric drive systems.

Therefore concepts for a fast turn off of DC lines, especially in case of a short circuit fault, are needed. Turning the complete DC-transmission system off is too slow and not suitable for large grids. To overcome this, several bidirectional HVDC circuit breaker topologies have been developed. However, fast bidirectional circuit breakers contain a huge number of semiconductors. As alternative unidirectional circuit breakers can be used, which have a lower number of semiconductors. This paper focuses on the applicability of unidirectional hybrid circuit breakers, which are derived from four bidirectional circuit breaker concepts. In addition, a detailed comparison of the unidirectional circuits breaker topologies is presented.","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695617.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unidirectional hybrid circuit breaker topologies for multi-line nodes in HVDC grids","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695617","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unidirectional hybrid circuit breaker topologies for multi-line nodes in HVDC grids","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16412847","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695617/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unidirectional hybrid circuit breaker topologies for multi-line nodes in HVDC grids","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0534epe2016full09410284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074515S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695665,"authors":[{"name":"Andrija Stupar","affiliation":["Laboratory for Integrated SMPS, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrija","lastName":"Stupar","id":"37542612900"},{"name":"Timothy McRae","affiliation":["Laboratory for Integrated SMPS, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"McRae","id":"38232205300"},{"name":"Nenad Vukadinovic","affiliation":["Laboratory for Integrated SMPS, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Nenad","lastName":"Vukadinovic","id":"37085700016"},{"name":"Aleksandar Prodic","affiliation":["Laboratory for Integrated SMPS, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Prodic","id":"37276053700"},{"name":"Josh A.

To ensure reliable drive with an induction machine requires deep insight in electro-mechanical dynamics during its operation. The flexible multibody modeling technique enables the simulation of dynamic loads on all drive components. This paper focuses on complex dynamic modeling of machine's behavior in case of eccentrically placed rotor supported by nonlinear bearing with radial clearance. The life time of machine's bearing becomes very important issue of machine's maintenance and reliability and is markedly influenced by any unbalanced forces acting on the rotor. Only the complex electro-mechanical models of the rotor considering all unbalanced electrical and mechanical rotor forces can provide the very detailed information about the bearing load. The methodology of determination of such loading is applied to the 11 kW squirrel-cage induction machine.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Force","Load modeling","Shafts","Torque","Finite element analysis","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","maintenance engineering","reliability","rolling bearings","rotors","squirrel cage motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction machine dynamic load","rotor eccentricity","bearing clearance","rolling element bearings","electromechanical dynamics","flexible multibody modeling technique","drive component","dynamic load simulation","machine behavior complex dynamic modeling","machine maintenance","machine reliability","electrical rotor force","mechanical rotor force","squirrel-cage induction machine","power 11 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction motor","Modelling","Simulation","Time-Domain Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695684","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2016.7695684","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588973/7695111/07695684.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2016.7695684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695684/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic load of induction machine due to rotor's eccentricity and bearing clearance","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16413133","htmlLink":"/document/7695684/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic load of induction machine due to rotor's eccentricity and bearing clearance","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0649epe2016full14280033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061962S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695685,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Carastro","affiliation":["GE Global Research, Garching b.

Surges can occur in high power converters used for motor drives and grid connected systems. A novel testbench and testing procedure is introduced which allows fairly rapid type-test characterization of modules without the need to perform manual-intensive module characterization after each test. Based on the limited tests done so far, it can be seen that Si PiN diodes still retain an advantage as far as surge current limitation is concerned, followed by Mosfet body diodes in SiC with Schottky diodes in SiC at the last place. Experimental and manufacturer data are here combined into a transient thermal model which helps understand the destruction mechanisms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16413147","htmlLink":"/document/7695685/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigation on diode surge forward current ruggedness of Si and SiC power modules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on diode surge forward current ruggedness of Si and SiC power modules","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"0650epe2016full00121914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052442S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588973","isNumber":"7695111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588973","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7695111","articleId":"7695685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE and EPE Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695696,"authors":[{"name":"Petre-Marian Nicolae","affiliation":["FACULTY OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF CRAIOVA, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Petre-Marian","lastName":"Nicolae","id":"38558647300"},{"name":"Dinu\u0163-Lucian Popa","affiliation":["FACULTY OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF CRAIOVA, Craiova, Romania"],"firstName":"Dinu\u0163-Lucian","lastName":"Popa","id":"37074071100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1524-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1410-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7695696","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"abstract":"The performance of some Fourier transform based fundamental current detection algorithms is evaluated and compared in this paper. Some difficult conditions are imposed by a load which draws a highly distorted current with a slight fluctuation, i.e. with non-equal semi-periods. The implemented algorithms are Recursive Discrete Fourier Transform (RDFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) implemented through a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and respectively the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with Butterfly operation and radix-2 decimation in time (DIT). A digital signal processor (DSP) based solution is used for real-time implementation, namely a dSPACE 1103 controller development board. MATLAB/Simulink software is used for the design of the algorithms because it provides specialized tools and blocks. For the performance comparison one used criteria like total harmonic distortion (THD) and settling time of detected fundamental current and also the run time for the DSP. This study may be useful as a guide for engineers in selecting the suitable Fourier transform based control algorithm for active power filters or other grid-synchronized equipments which are operating in difficult load conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'16 ECCE

Using two orthogonal feedings, the antenna can achieve dual polarized radiation patterns in both bands. With the compact dual co-located cavities structure, the proposed MIMO antenna shows good port-to-port isolation better than 17.5 dB in both operation bands. The radiation patterns also shows decent polarization isolation greater than 15dB. The proposed MIMO antenna is very compact as it integrates four-port antennas in the same radiating area. The proposed dual-band and dual-polarized antenna with unidirectional radiation patterns is suitable for smart antenna system in advanced MIMO wireless communication applications.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695744","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","startPage":"71","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel four-port antennas backed by co-located dual cavities for dual-band and dual-polarized MIMO applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel four-port antennas backed by co-located dual cavities for dual-band and dual-polarized MIMO applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695744/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412491","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel four-port antennas backed by co-located dual cavities for dual-band and dual-polarized MIMO applications","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033431S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695745,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ikram","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Ikram","id":"37664072900"},{"name":"Rifaqat Hussain","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Rifaqat","lastName":"Hussain","id":"38282017500"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

For homogeneous, smoothly inhomogeneous areas and the perfectly matched layer (PML), finite difference method is employed to improve the computational efficiency, as the staircasing approximation in these areas causes negligible errors and moreover Cartesian grid discretization results in fewer numbers of unknowns with respect to a tetrahedron mesh. For irregular geometries, spectral element or finite element method is utilized by employing unstructured mesh to eliminate the staircasing errors. The proposed hybrid DGTD method divide the original model into FDTD, buffer and SETD/FETD regions. When the buffer and SETD/FETD regions are with large DoFs, they can be further split into multiple subdomains to reduce computational complexity. To improve the time-marching efficiency, the explicit leapfrog (LF) time integration is employed for the FDTD and buffer regions, and an implicit Crank-Nicolson (CN) based time integration is used for the FETD region. For the SETD region both explicit and implicit time integration can apply. Thus, a global implicit-explicit time integration is given for the hybrid method. Numerical results are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and long-time stability of the proposed hybrid method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation

Furthermore, metamaterial-based gap waveguide technology provides a resonance-free packaging solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695835/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412032","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"mm-Wave contactless connection for MMIC integration in gap waveguides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"mm-Wave contactless connection for MMIC integration in gap waveguides","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08614S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7695837,"authors":[{"name":"Chetan Kumar Munuswamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chetan Kumar","lastName":"Munuswamy","id":"37085636540"},{"name":"Jayanti Venkataraman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jayanti","lastName":"Venkataraman","id":"37265855900"},{"name":"Amlan Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Amlan","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37544479300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7695837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695837","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooling","Wireless communication","Integrated circuit interconnections","Three-dimensional displays","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cooling","microfluidics","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D wireless network-on-chip","microfluidic cooling layers","wireless interconnects","interior heating","zig-zag antennas","thermofluidic layers","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network on chip","zigzag antenna","cooling channel"]}],"abstract":"Recent trend in 3-D Network on a Chip (NoC) utilizing wireless interconnects to improve communication speeds have been successful. Liquid cooling channels introduced on top and bottom still leave the interior of the chip as a hot spot. In the present work, novel architecture of 3-D NoC is modeled in different configurations of embedded micro fluidic layers to address the interior heating. Wired interconnects through the fluidic layers is not possible, zig-zag antennas are implemented and placed in different configurations, to serve as wireless interconnects. The thermo-fluidic layers are modeled as channels of dielectric constant 1.75. Each antenna has been individually designed and successfully tuned to resonate at 60 GHz with a return loss (RL) less than -10dB, using ANSYS High Frequency System Simulator (HFSS). The paper also discusses the transmission coefficients and shows low noise up to 10 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695837","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695837.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of antennas for 3D wireless Network-on-Chip with micro-fluidic cooling layers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of antennas for 3D wireless Network-on-Chip with micro-fluidic cooling layers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16411975","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7695837/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of antennas for 3D wireless Network-on-Chip with micro-fluidic cooling layers","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058675S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7695844,"authors":[{"name":"Kepei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, US"],"firstName":"Kepei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085494986"},{"name":"Jun H.

It achieves EVM of 10.5% when transmitting 1 Mbps 16-QAM signal with 20 dBm power at 1.93 GHz carrier frequency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"16-QAM impedance loading board design supporting single RF beamspace MIMO system","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695872","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695872.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"16-QAM impedance loading board design supporting single RF beamspace MIMO system","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695872/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16411870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"16-QAM impedance loading board design supporting single RF beamspace MIMO system","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037214S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7695874,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Alay\u00f3n Glazunov","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s Alay\u00f3n","lastName":"Glazunov"},{"name":"Sadegh Mansouri Moghaddam","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Sadegh Mansouri","lastName":"Moghaddam"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7695874","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"We derive the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) efficiency of the Zero-Forcing (ZF) receiver algorithm in Random Line-Of-Sight (Random-LOS).

The antenna provides almost directional patterns with acceptable gain values at both frequency band of operation.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695908","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695908.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual band (28/38 GHz) CPW slot directive antenna for future 5G cellular applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dual band (28/38 GHz) CPW slot directive antenna for future 5G cellular applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695908/","publicationDate":"June 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16412342","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695908/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual band (28/38 GHz) CPW slot directive antenna for future 5G cellular applications","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112027S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7695935,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Ao Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Wen-Ao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085454620"},{"name":"Zhi-Hong Tu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Hong","lastName":"Tu","id":"37309974500"},{"name":"Yan-Yan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yan-Yan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085622121"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7695935","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1241},"abstract":"In this letter, a dual-band differential CPW-fed MIMO antenna for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) application is proposed. The antenna has a square ring ground and a common patch which is shared by two pairs of differentially-fed ports. By arranging two pairs of differential ports orthogonally in the virtual ac ground of each other, the differential isolation can be infinite theoretically without using decoupling structures and dual-polarization are obtained. Since all of the structures are printed on the same layer of the substrate, it can be fabricated easily and is very suitable to be integrated with RF front-end circuits. The measured dual bands are 3.2-3.87 GHz and 5.35-5.83 GHz, along with high isolation better than 35 dB.

EGaIn, a non-toxic LMA, is filled into a 3D printed helix channel and form the helical antenna. As the gain of the antenna is determined by the number of turns of the helix which is controlled by the volume of LMA, the gain of the antenna can be tuned when needed. A more than 4 dB gain increase around 5 GHz is measured with the prototype when the number of turns of helix increases from 2 to 8 (0.2 mL LMA volume change), which demonstrates the reconfigurability of the proposed helical antenna.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695943.pdf","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695943","startPage":"469","endPage":"470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D printed reconfigurable helical antenna based on microfluidics and liquid metal alloy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695943/","displayDocTitle":"3D printed reconfigurable helical antenna based on microfluidics and liquid metal alloy","htmlLink":"/document/7695943/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16412054","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D printed reconfigurable helical antenna based on microfluidics and liquid metal alloy","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058963S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7695949,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Long Huang","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guan-Long","lastName":"Huang","id":"38500377100"},{"name":"Shi-Gang Zhou","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shi-Gang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38481216000"},{"name":"Tan-Huat Chio","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tan-Huat","lastName":"Chio","id":"37266284100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7695949","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Printing","Horn antennas","Rectangular waveguides","Antenna accessories","Waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["horn antennas","printing","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide structure","weight-reduction technique","electrical property","lightweight perforated X-band horn antenna","metal-sheet perforation technique","3D metal-direct-printing technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D printing","lightweight","metal-sheet perforation","horn antenna"]}],"abstract":"Waveguide structures are always known for being bulky and heavy.

To avoid mesh distortion or the expensive process of repeatedly creating a conformal mesh for each design configuration, the problem geometry is projected onto a fixed background mesh that is not necessarily conformal to the geometry. The IGFEM, with an enriched solution space in nonconformal elements, is adopted for an accurate EM simulation. An analytical sensitivity analysis is presented to compute the derivatives of the objective and constraint functions. Because of the fixed background mesh, the design velocity field term in the sensitivity analysis is evaluated only at the geometry interfaces, and the efficiency of this method is significantly enhanced. An optimization of the radius of a dielectric cylinder to achieve the desired echo width is presented for verification.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07695998.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"580","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7695998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7695998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7695998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gradient-based shape optimization for electromagnetic problems using IGFEM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Shape","Finite element analysis","Sensitivity analysis","Linear programming","Electromagnetics","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic waves","finite element analysis","gradient methods","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient based shape optimization scheme","electromagnetic problems","interface enriched generalized finite element method","IGFEM","mesh distortion","analytical sensitivity analysis","dielectric cylinder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7695998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Gradient-based shape optimization for electromagnetic problems using IGFEM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7695998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412169","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient-based shape optimization for electromagnetic problems using IGFEM","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054924S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7695998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696000,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085531822"},{"name":"Fei Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Electronic Information and Communications"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37536063100"},{"name":"Liang Lang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Electronic Information and Communications"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Lang","id":"37545100200"},{"name":"Liang Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085529960"},{"name":"Xiaohui Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085612151"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696000","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Radiometers","Apertures","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","artificial immune systems","optimisation","radiometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","circular lattice arrays","aperture synthesis radiometers","thinned array layout optimization","multiobjective immune algorithm","MOIA","artificial immune systems","AIS","rectangular spatial frequency coverage","satisfactory performance indexes","ASRs","snapshot imaging applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture synthesis radiometer (ASR)","circular lattice array (CLA)","immune algorithm","multi-objective optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696000","abstract":"To optimize the thinned array layout of circular lattice array (CLA), a multi-objective immune algorithm (MOIA) that introduces the mnemonic mechanism of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is presented in this paper.

The derivation of multiscale and multiphysics SbD-based task-oriented design techniques is then introduced, and its application is discussed also through a numerical example.

However, recent work showed that passive resonant feed networks of these MFPAs limit the performance in terms of bandwidth and loss as the FPA size gets larger for high gain applications (e.g. <;3% bandwidth for >8 elements). This paper alleviates this issue by introducing a novel microfluidically switched feed network. Specifically, microfluidic repositioning of a selectively metallized plate is utilized as the switching mechanism to direct the input RF power towards a desired antenna location. It is shown that the proposed feed network maintains a wideband performance (>15%) and can accommodate >32 antenna elements in a 1D 30GHz Ka-band array setting. In addition, the required microfluidic motion range is significantly reduced (~10\u00d7) for higher beam-scanning speeds and a compact layout is maintained for enabling realization of 2D MFPAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696031.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-loss wideband feed networks for high gain microfluidic beam-scanning focal plane arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Bandwidth","Switches","Microfluidics","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","focal planes","microfluidics","microwave antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-loss wideband feed network","high gain microfluidic beam scanning focal plane array","beam-scanning capability","passive resonant feed network","microfluidically switched feed network","switching mechanism","Ka-band array setting","2D MFPA","frequency 30 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microfluidics","focal plane arrays","reconfigurable antenna","Ka-band","beam-scanning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Low-loss wideband feed networks for high gain microfluidic beam-scanning focal plane arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696031/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412104","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-loss wideband feed networks for high gain microfluidic beam-scanning focal plane arrays","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035987S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696033,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed absorber shows a stable performance under oblique angles of incidence for both polarizations.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696046","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696046.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-polarized absorber based on 3-D frequency selective structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696046/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-polarized absorber based on 3-D frequency selective structure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16411986","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696046/","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-polarized absorber based on 3-D frequency selective structure","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0000675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078978S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696049,"authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

The analysis is proposed for 2 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4 sub arrays on Rogers 5880 substrate with a relative dielectric permittivity \u03b5r=2.2 in order to achieve an objective of high gain and narrow beamwidth, which can be used for target tracking and precise detection applications. The solution frequency is chosen as 32.5 GHz which yields 3 dB beamwidth of ~ 20\u00b0 and ~13\u00b0 for 2 \u00d7 2 and 4 \u00d7 4 AFLTSA structures respectively. The realized gain achieved for these two structures is 12.39 dB and 14.19 dB respectively.

It has been recently applied to inverse scattering problems numerous times without validating the properties of the system matrix. In this article, we seek to validate the applicability of CS to the inverse scattering problem. We formulate the problem such that the system matrix remains simple and universally applicable by using only a homogeneous background medium and then applying the CS constraints. Our analysis shows that the constraints can be satisfied under various scenarios. We then show the results of application of two such possible constraints.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696219","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696219.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical derivation of RIP-less compressive sensing for inverse scattering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical derivation of RIP-less compressive sensing for inverse scattering","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696219/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412482","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7696219/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical derivation of RIP-less compressive sensing for inverse scattering","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034992S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696221,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Obermeier","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Obermeier","id":"38276293800"},{"name":"Jose Angel Martinez-Lorenzo","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jose Angel","lastName":"Martinez-Lorenzo","id":"38270469600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696221","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Standards","Electromagnetics","Imaging","Permittivity","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","electromagnetic wave propagation","optimisation","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconstruction capabilities","alternating direction method of multipliers","fundamental constraints","physicality constrained compressive sensing optimization program","complex permittivity","electromagnetic imaging applications","physicality constrained compressive sensing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The goal of many electromagnetic imaging applications is to recover the complex permittivity of an object of interest.

The contribution of this paper is two folds: Firstly, a real-time ECG signal acquisition is performed using a Shimmer platform. Secondly, the collected are processed by the mean of compressed sensing approach to reduce the signal size and cope with the sensors requirements of high energy efficiency, thus a longer battery life. The recovery of the original signal is afterwards ensured by resorting to Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithms and PSNR is used as a metric for the reliability of the signal reconstruction. Several tests are carried out each time by either modifying the type and the size of the dictionaries or the number of iterations. It is shown that the best signal reconstruction is achieved by a value of PSNR that reaches 57 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696297.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1180","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real ECG signal acquisition with shimmer platform and using of compressed sensing techniques in the offline signal reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Electrocardiography","Dictionaries","Compressed sensing","Signal reconstruction","Sensors","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","electrocardiography","energy conservation","iterative methods","medical signal processing","signal reconstruction","telecommunication power management","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signal acquisition","shimmer platform","compressed sensing techniques","offline signal reconstruction","ECG signal recovery quality","energy efficiency","battery life","orthogonal matching pursuit","OMP algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real ECG signal acquisition with shimmer platform and using of compressed sensing techniques in the offline signal reconstruction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696297/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412653","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real ECG signal acquisition with shimmer platform and using of compressed sensing techniques in the offline signal reconstruction","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038853S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696299,"authors":[{"name":"Muhannad A.

Full-wave simulation shows that the passive gain is 27.6 dBi with aperture efficiency of 50.6%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696309","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696309.pdf","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1204","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an amplifying reflectarray antenna with improved isolation performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of an amplifying reflectarray antenna with improved isolation performance","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7696309/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16411773","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696309/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an amplifying reflectarray antenna with improved isolation performance","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05078S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7696316,"authors":[{"name":"Ruyuan Deng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruyuan","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085461561"},{"name":"Shenheng Xu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shenheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085343303"},{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085362532"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696316","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":710},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Apertures","Feeds","Propagation losses","Gain","Satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surfaces","microwave antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","reflectarray antennas","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ku/Ka quad-band reflectarray antenna","satellite communications","frequency selective surface","FSS","Ka-band elements","Ku-band elements","Phoenix-type element","CST","GPU","frequency 12.5 GHz","frequency 14.25 GHz","frequency 20.4 GHz","frequency 30.2 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A quad-band reflectarray antenna that operates at both Ku (12.5 and 14.25 GHz) and Ka (20.4 and 30.2 GHz) bands is designed for satellite communications. The multi-layer configuration is adopted with the frequency selective surface (FSS) backed Ka-band elements above the Ku-band elements. An FSS with triple ring slots is optimized to achieve transmission at Ku band and reflection at Ka band simultaneously. A triple-resonance element with two square loops and a square patch is designed for wideband operation at Ku band, while a Phoenix-type element is designed for dual-frequency operation at Ka band. The dual-frequency phase synthesis method is then utilized separately at both bands to achieve receive/transmit coverage.

Some preliminary results show the accuracy and the saving time of the proposed methodology in comparison with standard approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696415/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16411842","publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696415/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of next generation reflectarrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of next generation reflectarrays","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05952S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696435,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085472021"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Ruisi He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruisi","lastName":"He","id":"37085471473"},{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Guan","id":"37404288100"},{"name":"Jianzhi Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085770449"},{"name":"Dan Fei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Fei","id":"37085357473"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696435","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO","Delays","Linear antenna arrays","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","delay estimation","indoor radio","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","massive MIMO channel measurement","massive MIMO communication","indoor scenario","sliding-window SAGE algorithm","transmitter side antenna array","space domain","angular domain","delay domain","frequency 6 GHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the channel measurements for Massive MIMO communications in indoor scenario at 6 GHz.

The success of CS techniques is motivated by several factors, including (i) their capability to address sampling/recovery problems overcoming the classical Nyquist/Shannon limits, (ii) their flexibility and ease of adaptation to several different scenarios, including array design, direction-of-arrival estimation, microwave and radar imaging, (iii) the availability of powerful, effective, and numerically efficient implementations of CS sampling and retrieval algorithms. Accordingly, and despite their relatively recent introduction, the research on the development, application, generalization, and customization of CS techniques has already become one of the most active areas within wave scattering and propagation engineering. Within this framework, this invited paper is aimed at illustrating the fundamental features of Compressive Sensing as well as at discussing its potential applicability in wave scattering and propagation problems also through a review of the recent advances in the state-of-the-art concerning CS. Some current research trends and open challenges will be also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696469","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696469.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing as a new paradigm in wave scattering and propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696469/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing as a new paradigm in wave scattering and propagation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412364","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696469/","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing as a new paradigm in wave scattering and propagation","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09101S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696501,"authors":[{"name":"Sensen Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"firstName":"Sensen","lastName":"Li","id":"37085668842"},{"name":"Taiyun Chi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"firstName":"Taiyun","lastName":"Chi","id":"37085386492"},{"name":"Jong Seok Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Jong Seok","lastName":"Park","id":"37076021200"},{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538488700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696501","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Antenna feeds","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna-level power combining","multifeed antenna structure","radiation characteristics","proof-of-concept design","two-feed slot antenna","three-feed slot antenna","input feeding network","single-feed slot antenna","radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna","multi-feed antenna","power combining","radiation pattern"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a multi-feed antenna structure that synthesizes the desired radiation characteristics with antenna-level power combining. Compared with an antenna array that spatially combines the radiation E-field and H-field at the far-field, the proposed multi-feed antenna combines the radiation power from different feeds directly on the antenna. Such a unique structure occupies a much smaller footprint and offers the flexibility to optimize the antenna driving impedances based on the locations of the antenna feeds. As two proof-of-concept designs, a two-feed 0.5\u03bb slot antenna and a three-feed 0.7\u03bb slot antenna with the input feeding networks are designed at 10.3GHz. A conventional single-feed 0.5\u03bb slot antenna and a single-feed 0.7\u03bb slot antenna are also implemented as the reference designs. Well matched radiation patterns between the proposed multi-feed antennas and the conventional single-feed antennas are observed, demonstrating the antenna-level power combining capability of the proposed multi-feed antennas.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-feed antenna for antenna-level power combining","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696501","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696501.pdf","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A multi-feed antenna for antenna-level power combining","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696501/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16412694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-feed antenna for antenna-level power combining","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088389S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696521,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory M.

As a result, a single analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be used for a group of antenna elements. Initial design and verification of the OSCR was done at L-band. But its functionality can be extended at higher frequency, including C, X and Ku-bands. In this paper, we present a 4-channel high frequency dual-band OSCR implementation and validation. Specifically, measurements are performed in the anechoic chamber using an UWB array operating at 4-18 GHz, to estimate the phase of incoming signals and for direction finding. It is verified that on-site coding has minimal or no phase error and degradation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696534/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16412667","publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696534/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dual-band validation of on-site coding receiver using ultra-wideband antenna array at C, X and Ku-bands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-band validation of on-site coding receiver using ultra-wideband antenna array at C, X and Ku-bands","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067684S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696535,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Siafarikas","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept., The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Siafarikas","id":"37085807760"},{"name":"Elias A.

Virtually all current approaches estimate the DoA based on the phase of the impinging signal on a sensor array. This approach has several challenges: for example, it requires tight synchronization amongst array elements, and the estimated DoA is very sensitive to the specification of the array geometry. We propose a Bayesian DoA estimation procedure based on the received signal strength (RSS) gradient. RSS is readily computed by most sensors, and the RSS gradient points towards the source when the received signal's dominant component is the direct path. Though non-uniform shadowing, small-scale fading, and multipath generally corrupt the accuracy of the RSS gradient as a DoA estimate, these effects are significantly less at lower VHF. We show through simulations and applications to actual datasets that our approach provides a simple and accurate method to estimate DoA and its associated uncertainty, even in cluttered environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16412411","htmlLink":"/document/7696554/","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Direction of arrival estimation with the received signal strength gradient at the lower VHF band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction of arrival estimation with the received signal strength gradient at the lower VHF band","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092126S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696555,"authors":[{"name":"Moulay El Azhari","affiliation":["Universite du Quebec en Abitibi Temiscamingue, Rouyn-Noranda, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Moulay","lastName":"El Azhari","id":"37085666460"},{"name":"Mourad Nedil","affiliation":["UQAT, Val d'or, Canada"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Nedil","id":"37276349500"},{"name":"Ismail Ben Mabrouk","affiliation":["UQO, Gatineau, Canada"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Ben Mabrouk","id":"37947693000"},{"name":"Larbi Talbi","affiliation":["UQO, Gatineau, Canada"],"firstName":"Larbi","lastName":"Talbi","id":"37085417925"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696555","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Loss measurement","Patch antennas","Wireless communication","Antenna measurements","Body area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","MIMO communication","mining industry","underground communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","patch antennas","path loss effect","off-body channel capacity","underground gold mine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","off-body channel","channel capacity","frequency response","path loss"]}],"abstract":"The effect of path loss on the channel capacity of a MIMO off-body system using patch antennas is considered in this paper.

In the simulation two UWB-MIMO antennas with copper conductors and graphene-based conductors (GBC) are designed separately. The ground planes of both radiators are made of copper, only the top side is made with different conductors. A T-shaped decoupling structure is placed on the ground plane to reduce the coupling between the radiating patches. These two prototypes, one with copper conductors and the other one with GBCs are fabricated. A good agreement between the S-parameters of both prototypes is found. The measured radiation patterns of both prototypes also exhibit similar properties. Whereas, the GBC antenna showed a lower gain as compared to the copper antenna, as depicted in radiation patterns. However, impedance matching and the radiation characteristics of the GBC antenna also showed that graphene can be a good alternative to copper in UWB-MIMO conformal antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7588778/7695700/07696590.pdf","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1768","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (APSURSI)","doi":"10.1109/APS.2016.7696590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2016.7696590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7695700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7696590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A properties comparison between copper and graphene-based UWB MIMO planar antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Antennas","Conductors","Antenna measurements","Prototypes","MIMO","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","conductors (electric)","conformal antennas","copper","graphene","impedance matching","MIMO communication","planar antenna arrays","S-parameters","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphene-based UWB MIMO planar antennas","copper-based UWB MIMO planar antennas","ultrawideband MIMO antennas","multiple-input-multiple-output antennas","copper conductors","graphene-based conductors","GBC antenna","ground planes","radiators","T-shaped decoupling structure","radiating patches","S-parameters","measured radiation patterns","copper antenna","impedance matching","radiation characteristics","UWB-MIMO conformal antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7696590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A properties comparison between copper and graphene-based UWB MIMO planar antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7696590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16411760","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","conferenceDate":"26 June-1 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A properties comparison between copper and graphene-based UWB MIMO planar antennas","confLoc":"Fajardo, PR, USA","sourcePdf":"0001767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089643S","chronDate":"June 26 2016-July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588778","isNumber":"7695700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588778","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7695700","articleId":"7696590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7696591,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland","Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Koziel","id":"37270222900"},{"name":"Adrian Bekasiewicz","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland","Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bekasiewicz","id":"38233401400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2886-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2885-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2887-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7696591","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":530},"abstract":"In the paper, a concept and design procedure of a novel compact MIMO slot antenna is presented.

The method is simpler than using the 3D far field pattern method and also more reliable and accurate than using the S-parameters method. It only requires the S-parameters and the radiation efficiency and gives good estimation of the correlation coefficient. The results of the proposed method are in close agreement with the values obtained from the far field method.

If plural MIMO antennas are installed closely, mutual coupling between the antennas must be reduced to suppress deterioration of radiation efficiency and increase of the correlation coefficient. In previous studies, a decoupling method for single-band using bifurcation elements has been confirmed. However, if operating for single-band, it is not possible to introduce CA technology.
