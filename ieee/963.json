Those strategies are especially important for medical applications in order to achieve e.g. good acceptance of hand prostheses among amputees. A recurrent neural network with a small footprint is deployed to estimate the joint positions from surface electromyography data measured at the forearm. As the predictions are expected to be not smooth, different post processing methods and a regularisation term for the objective function of the network are proposed. The experiments were conducted on publicly available databases. The results reveal that both post processing strategies and regularisation have a positive impact on the results with a maximal relative improvement of 6.13 %. On the one hand post processing strategies introduce an additional delay, consequently, the improvement is analysed in context of the caused delay. On the other hand the regularisation strategy does not cause a delay and can be adjusted easily to cope with different ground truths or compensate for certain problems in the hand tracking.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630042","startPage":"6519","endPage":"6523","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09630042.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"sEMG-Based Hand Movement Regression by Prediction of Joint Angles With Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630042/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"sEMG-Based Hand Movement Regression by Prediction of Joint Angles With Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9630042/","pubMedId":"34892603","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"sEMG-Based Hand Movement Regression by Prediction of Joint Angles With Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"1763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055813S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9630042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9630062,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These wearables typically acquire single-lead ECGs that are mainly used for screening of cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Most arrhythmias are characteruzed by changes in the RR-interval, hence automatic methods to diagnose arrythmia may utilize R-peak detection. Existing R-peak detection methods are fairly accurate but have limited precision. To enable data-point precise detection of R-peaks, we propose a method that uses a fully convolutional dilated neural network. The network is trained and evaluated with manually annotated R-peaks in a heterogeneous set of ECGs that contain a wide range of cardiac rhythms and acquisition noise. 700 randomly chosen ECGs from the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2017 were used for training (n=500), validation (n=100) and testing (n=100). The network achieves a precision of 0.910, recall of 0.926, and an F1-score of 0.918 on the test set.

However, manual techniques which require human expertise to count coughs are both expensive and time-consuming. Recent Automatic Cough Detection Algorithms (ACDAs) have shown promise to meet clinical monitoring requirements, but only in recent years they have made their way to non-clinical settings due to the required portability of sensing technologies and the extended duration of data recording. More precisely, these ACDAs operate at high sampling frequencies, which leads to high power consumption and computing requirements, making these difficult to implement on a wearable device. Additionally, reproducibility of their performance is essential. Unfortunately, as the majority of ACDAs were developed using private clinical data, it is difficult to reproduce their results. We, hereby, present an ACDA that meets clinical monitoring requirements and reliably operates at a low sampling frequency. This ACDA is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and publicly available data. It achieves a sensitivity of 92.7%, a specificity of 92.3%, and an accuracy of 92.5% using a sampling frequency of just 750 Hz. We also show that a low sampling frequency allows us to preserve patients\u2019 privacy by obfuscating their speech, and we analyze the trade-off between speech obfuscation for privacy and cough detection accuracy.Clinical relevance\u2014This paper presents a new cough detection technique and preliminary analysis on the trade-off between detection accuracy and obfuscation of speech for privacy.

However, most of the affective computing models are based on images, audio, videos and brain signals. There is a lack of prior studies that focus on utilizing only peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition, which can ideally be implemented in daily life settings using wearables, e.g., smartwatches. Here, an emotion classification method using peripheral physiological signals, obtained by wearable devices that enable continuous monitoring of emotional states, is presented. A Long Short-Term Memory neural network-based classification model is proposed to accurately predict emotions in real-time into binary levels and quadrants of the arousal-valence space. The peripheral sensored data used here were collected from 20 participants, who engaged in a naturalistic debate. Different annotation schemes were adopted and their impact on the classification performance was explored. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of our method with a measured accuracy of >93% and >89% for binary levels and quad classes, respectively.

Accurate detection of J-peak is the key to get critical indicators from BCG signals. With the development of deep learning methods, many researches have applied convolution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based models in J-peak detection. However, these deep learning methods have limitations in inference speed and model complexity. To improve the computational efficiency and memory utilization, we propose a robust lightweight neural network model, called JwaveNet. Moreover, in the preprocessing stage, J-peaks are re-modeled by a new transformation method based on their physiological meaning, which has been proven to increase performance. In our experiment, BCG signals, including four different sleeping positions, were collected from 24 subjects with synchronous electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The experiment results have shown that our lightweight model greatly reduces latency and model size compared to other baseline models with high detecting accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630255","startPage":"269","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09630255.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient J Peak Detection From Ballistocardiogram Using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network<sup>*</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630255/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient J Peak Detection From Ballistocardiogram Using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network<sup>*</sup>","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9630255/","pubMedId":"34891288","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient J Peak Detection From Ballistocardiogram Using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network<sup>*</sup>","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"0560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048636S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9630255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9630304,"authors":[{"name":"Shuqiong Wu","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuqiong","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Fumio Okura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumio","lastName":"Okura"},{"name":"Yasushi Makihara","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Makihara"},{"name":"Kota Aoki","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Aoki"},{"name":"Masataka Niwa","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Niwa"},{"name":"Yasushi Yagi","affiliation":["Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Yagi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9630304","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Machine learning","Sensitivity and specificity","Tools","Feature extraction","Skeleton","Data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9630304","abstract":"Detecting low cognitive scores at an early stage is important for delaying the progress of dementia. Investigations of early-stage detection have employed automatic assessment using dual-task (i.e., performing two different tasks simultaneously). However, current approaches to dual-task-based detection are based on either simple features or limited motion information, which degrades the detection accuracy. To address this problem, we proposed a framework that uses graph convolutional networks to extract spatio-temporal features from dual-task performance data. Moreover, to make the proposed method robust against data imbalance, we devised a loss function that directly optimizes the summation of the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of low cognitive scores (i.e., score\u2264 23 or score\u2264 27). Our evaluation is based on 171 subjects from 6 different senior citizens\u2019 facilities. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the previous standard with respect to both the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of low cognitive scores.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630304","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1901","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09630304.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Detection of Low Cognitive Scores from Dual-task Performance Data Using a Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630304/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Early Detection of Low Cognitive Scores from Dual-task Performance Data Using a Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9630304/","pubMedId":"34891657","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Detection of Low Cognitive Scores from Dual-task Performance Data Using a Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"0782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073733S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9630304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9630431,"authors":[{"name":"Ankhzaya Jamsrandorj","affiliation":["University of Science & Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ankhzaya","lastName":"Jamsrandorj","id":"37089188864"},{"name":"Mau Dung Nguyen","affiliation":["University of Science & Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mau Dung","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37087028992"},{"name":"Mina Park","affiliation":["University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mina","lastName":"Park","id":"37087032787"},{"name":"Konki Sravan Kumar","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Konki Sravan","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37089183972"},{"name":"Kyung-Ryoul Mun","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Ryoul","lastName":"Mun","id":"37085660363"},{"name":"Jinwook Kim","affiliation":["Center for Artificial Intelligence, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068779100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9630431","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9630431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Event detection","Stacking","Senior citizens","Data acquisition","Feature extraction","Cameras"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Gait","Heel","Humans","Neural Networks, Computer","Probability","Walking"]}],"abstract":"Accurate gait events detection from the video would be a challenging problem.

Follicles are tracked over the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, and this analysis is usually performed manually by a medical practitioner. It is a challenging manual analysis and is prone to error as it is largely operator dependent. In this paper we propose a two-stage framework to address the clinical need for follicular growth tracking. The first stage comprises of an unsupervised deep learning network SFR-Net to automate registration of each and every follicle across the IVF cycle. SFR-Net is composed of the standard 3DUNet [1] and Multi-Scale Residual Blocks (MSRB) [2] in order to register follicles of varying sizes. In the second stage we use the registration result to track individual follicles across the IVF cycle. The 3D Transvaginal Ultrasound (3D TVUS) volumes were acquired from 26 subjects every 2-3 days, resulting in a total of 96 volume pairs for the registration and tracking task. On the test dataset we have achieved an average DICE score of 85.84% for the follicle registration task, and we are successfully able to track follicles above 4 mm. Ours is the novel attempt towards automated tracking of follicular growth [3].Clinical Relevance\u2014 Accurate tracking of follicle count and growth is of paramount importance to increase the effectiveness of IVF procedure. Correct predictions can help doctors provide better counselling to the patients and individualize treatment for ovarian stimulation. Favorable outcome of this assisted reproductive technique depends on the estimates of the quality and quantity of the follicular pool.

Both the SBP and the DBP accuracy rank grade A under the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol, demonstrating that our proposed method is an accurate way for cuff-less BP estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630557/","pubMedId":"34891464","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9630557/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation via Small Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005191","fundingName":"Craig H.

Sensors placed in the apartments of older adult residents generate a deluge of daily data that is automatically aggregated, analyzed, and summarized to aid in health awareness, clinical care, and research for healthy aging. When anomalies or concerning trends are detected within the data, the sensor information is converted into linguistic health messages using fuzzy computational techniques, so as to make it understandable to the clinicians. Sensor data are analyzed at the individual level, therefore, through this study we aim to discover various combinations of patterns of anomalies happening together and recurrently in the older adult\u2019s population using these text summaries. Leveraging various computational text data processing techniques, we are able to extract relevant analytical features from the health messages. These features are transformed into a transactional encoding, then processed with frequent pattern mining techniques for association rule discovery. At individual level analysis, resident ID 3027 was considered as an exemplar to describe the analysis. Seven combinations of anomalies/rules/associations were discovered in this resident, out of which rule group three showed an increased recurrence during the COVID lockdown of facility. At the population level, a total of 38 associations were discovered that highlight the health patterns, and we continue to explore the health conditions associated with them. Ultimately, our goal is to correlate the combinations of anomalies with certain health conditions, which can then be leveraged for predictive analytics and preventative care.

In this paper, we use transfer learning to tackle the mismatch of the recording setup. This allows us to transfer knowledge from one dataset to another dataset for crackle detection in lung sounds. In particular, a single input convolutional neural network (CNN) model is pre-trained on a source domain using ICBHI 2017, the largest publicly available database of lung sounds. We use log-mel spectrogram features of respiratory cycles of lung sounds. The pre-trained network is used to build a multi-input CNN model, which shares the same network architecture for respiratory cycles and their corresponding respiratory phases. The multi-input model is then fine-tuned on the target domain of our self-collected lung sound database for classifying crackles and normal lung sounds. Our experimental results show significant performance improvements of 9.84% (absolute) in F-score on the target domain using the multi-input CNN model and transfer learning for crackle detection.Clinical relevance\u2014 Crackle detection in lung sounds, multi-input convolutional neural networks, transfer learning.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630577","startPage":"80","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09630577.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crackle Detection In Lung Sounds Using Transfer Learning And Multi-Input Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Convolution","Biological system modeling","Atmospheric modeling","Transfer learning","Lung","Network architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Crackle Detection In Lung Sounds Using Transfer Learning And Multi-Input Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9630577/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","pubMedId":"34891244","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002428","fundingName":"Austrian Science Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crackle Detection In Lung Sounds Using Transfer Learning And Multi-Input Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"0224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07916S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9630577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9630630,"authors":[{"name":"Xingchen Ran","affiliation":["Academy for Advanced Studies, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xingchen","lastName":"Ran"},{"name":"Yiwei Zhang","affiliation":["Academy for Advanced Studies, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yiwei","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Chenye Shen","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chenye","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"Blaise Yvert","affiliation":["BrainTech Lab U1205, Inserm and University Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Blaise","lastName":"Yvert"},{"name":"Weidong Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology and Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Qiushi Academy for Advanced Studies of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Shaomin Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Cardio-Cerebral Vascular Detection Technology and Medicinal Effectiveness Appraisal, Qiushi Academy for Advanced Studies of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Shaomin","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9630630","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","Convolution","Feature extraction","Robustness","Decoding","Convolutional neural networks","Kalman filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9630630","abstract":"Local field potentials (LFPs) have better long-term stability compared with spikes in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Many studies have shown promising results of LFP decoding, but the high-dimensional feature of LFP still hurdle the development of the BMIs to low-cost. In this paper, we proposed a framework of a 1D convolution neural network (CNN) to reduce the dimensionality of the LFP features. For evaluating the performance of this architecture, the reduced LFP features were decoded to cursor position (Center-out task) by a Kalman filter. The Principal components analysis (PCA) was also performed as a comparison. The results showed that the CNN model could reduce the dimensionality of LFP features to a smaller size without significant performance loss. The decoding result based on the CNN features outperformed that based on the PCA features. Moreover, the reduced features by CNN also showed robustness across different sessions. These results demonstrated that the LFP features reduced by the CNN model achieved low cost without sacrificing high-performance and robustness, suggesting that this method could be used for portable BMI systems in the future.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630630","pdfPath":"/iel7/9629355/9629471/09630630.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1050","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","publicationTitle":"2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction of Local Field Potential Features with Convolution Neural Network in Neural Decoding: A Pilot Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9630630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction of Local Field Potential Features with Convolution Neural Network in Neural Decoding: A Pilot Study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","pubMedId":"34891468","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9630630/","conferenceDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensionality Reduction of Local Field Potential Features with Convolution Neural Network in Neural Decoding: A Pilot Study","confLoc":"Mexico","sourcePdf":"1901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073233S","chronDate":"1-5 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9629355","isNumber":"9629471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9629355","xplore-issue":"9629471","articleId":"9630630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9630880,"authors":[{"name":"Arin Ghazarian","affiliation":["Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arin","lastName":"Ghazarian","id":"38255816100"},{"name":"Jianwei Zheng","affiliation":["Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089185489"},{"name":"Hesham El-Askary","affiliation":["Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"El-Askary","id":"38272551100"},{"name":"Huimin Chu","affiliation":["Ningbo First Hospital, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Chu","id":"37089186923"},{"name":"Guohua Fu","affiliation":["Ningbo First Hospital, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Fu","id":"37089185820"},{"name":"Cyril Rakovski","affiliation":["Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Rakovski","id":"37089183517"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1179-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1178-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-1180-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2694-0604"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2375-7477"}],"articleNumber":"9630880","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9630880","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Privacy","Neural networks","Pacemakers","Electrocardiography","Tools","Fingerprint recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arrhythmia","Biometrics","Convolutional neural networks (CNN)","Deep Learning","ECG","ECG Identification","Privacy","Re-identification"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometric Identification","Deep Learning","Electrocardiography","Humans","Ventricular Premature Complexes"]}],"abstract":"ECGs analysis is an important tool in cardiac diagnosis.

In addition to discussing the general implications of the deployment of such systems related to privacy, for the first time, we also assess the accuracy of ECG-based identification for distinct heart condition groups (and combinations of such conditions) and the corresponding privacy implications. For instance, we discovered that in contrast to initial expectation that identification accuracy for healthy normal sinus rhythm should be the highest, the identification accuracy is higher for patients with sinus tachycardia or patients who are diagnosed with both ST changes and supraventricular tachycardia. This puts these patients at a higher risk of privacy issues due to re-identification. On the other hand, we observed that patients with premature ventricular contractions have an identification accuracy as low as 78.54%.

It is a powerful technical candidate to break through the traditional von Neumann computing architecture in the post-Moore era, which will provide a feasible scheme about a technological breakthrough for surpassing Moore\u2019s law.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3124407","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3124407","startPage":"4835","endPage":"4836","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09631149.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631149/","displayDocTitle":"Editorial Special Issue for 50th Birthday of Memristor Theory and Application of Neuromorphic Computing Based on Memristor -

Therefore, this paper combines spatio-temporal crowdsourcing and edge computing to study the Multi-Objective Optimization Task Assignment (MOO-TA) problem in the edge computing environment. The proposed online incentive mechanism considers the task difficulty attribute to motivate crowd workers to perform sensing tasks in the unpopular area. In this paper, the Weighted and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Combination (WAMOPSC) algorithm is proposed to maximize both platform's and crowd workers' utility, so as to maximize social welfare. The algorithm combines the traditional Linear Weighted Summation (LWS) algorithm and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to find pareto optimal solutions of multi-objective optimization task assignment problem as much as possible for crowdsourcing platform to choose.

By deploying edge computing centers at the edge of wireless access network, the computation tasks can be offloaded to edge servers rather than the remote cloud server to meet the requirements of 5G low-latency and high-reliability application scenarios. Meanwhile, with the development of IOV (Internet of Vehicles) technology, various delay-sensitive and compute-intensive in-vehicle applications continue to appear. Compared with traditional Internet business, these computation tasks have higher processing priority and lower delay requirements. In this paper, we design a 5G-based vehicle-aware Multi-access Edge Computing network (VAMECN) and propose a joint optimization problem of minimizing total system cost. In view of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning-based joint computation offloading and task migration optimization (JCOTM) algorithm is proposed, considering the influences of multiple factors such as concurrent multiple computation tasks, system computing resources distribution, and network communication bandwidth. And, the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is described as a Markov Decision Process. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce task processing delay and equipment energy consumption, optimize computing offloading and resource allocation schemes, and improve system resource utilization, compared with other computing offloading policies.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.003","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631180.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631180/","displayDocTitle":"Deep reinforcement learning-based computation offloading for 5G vehicle-aware multi-access edge computing network","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep reinforcement learning-based computation offloading for 5G vehicle-aware multi-access edge computing network","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016675S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631180","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631181,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Bao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Bao"},{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Liehuang Zhu","affiliation":["School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China"],"firstName":"Liehuang","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Lihong Wang","affiliation":["National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, Beijing 100029, China"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Ruiguang Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China; National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, Beijing 100029, China"],"firstName":"Ruiguang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Tielei Li","affiliation":["China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, Beijing 100048, China"],"firstName":"Tielei","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631181","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Privacy","Differential privacy","Cloud computing","Collaborative filtering","Perturbation methods","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["personalized recommendation","collaborative filtering","data perturbation","privacy protection","local differential privacy"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving collaborative filtering algorithm based on local differential privacy","abstract":"Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging technolohgy that extends cloud computing to the edge of a network.

In a MEC-based recommendation system, users' rating data are collected and analyzed by the edge servers. If the servers behave dishonestly or break down, users' privacy may be disclosed. To solve this issue, we design a recommendation framework that applies local differential privacy (LDP) to collaborative filtering. In the proposed framework, users' rating data are perturbed to satisfy LDP and then released to the edge servers. The edge servers perform partial computing task by using the perturbed data. The cloud computing center computes the similarity between items by using the computing results generated by edge servers. We propose a data perturbation method to protect user's original rating values, where the Harmony mechanism is modified so as to preserve the accuracy of similarity computation. And to enhance the protection of privacy, we propose two methods to protect both users' rating values and rating behaviors.

To provide an efficient management framework, the joint design of content delivery and recommendation in wireless content caching networks is studied in this paper. First, a joint transmission scheme of content objects and recommendation lists is designed with edge caching, and an optimization problem is formulated to balance the utility and cost of content caching and recommendation, which is an mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Second, a reinforcement learning based algorithm is proposed to implement real time management of content caching, recommendation and delivery, which can approach the optimal solution without iterations during each decision epoch. Finally, the simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme, which show that it can achieve lower cost than the existing content caching and recommendation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of content delivery and recommendation in wireless caching networks","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.005","endPage":"75","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631182.pdf","publicationTitle":"China Communications","startPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Resource management","Optimization","Loading","User experience","Throughput","Costs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless caching networks","content caching","content recommendation","deep reinforcement learning","resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint design of content delivery and recommendation in wireless caching networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint design of content delivery and recommendation in wireless caching networks","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01891S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631182","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631183,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Cao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266510, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"Weijian Ni","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266510, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Ni"},{"name":"Qingtian Zeng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266510, China"],"firstName":"Qingtian","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Faming Lu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266510, China"],"firstName":"Faming","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Cong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo 255000, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Hua Duan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266510, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Duan"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631183","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Business","Encoding","Concurrent computing","Deep learning","Recurrent neural networks","Process monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["business process monitoring","remaining time prediction","LSTM","feature representation","concurrency"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remaining time prediction for business processes with concurrency based on log representation","abstract":"Remaining time prediction of business processes plays an important role in resource scheduling and plan making. The structural features of single process instance and the concurrent running of multiple process instances are the main factors that affect the accuracy of the remaining time prediction. Existing prediction methods does not take full advantage of these two aspects into consideration. To address this issue, a new prediction method based on trace representation is proposed. More specifically, we first associate the prefix set generated by the event log to different states of the transition system, and encode the structural features of the prefixes in the state. Then, an annotation containing the feature representation for the prefix and the corresponding remaining time are added to each state to obtain an extended transition system. Next, states in the extended transition system are partitioned by the different lengths of the states, which considers concurrency among multiple process instances. Finally, the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural networks are applied to each partition for predicting the remaining time of new running instances. By extensive experimental evaluation using synthetic event logs and reallife event logs, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline methods.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631183","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631183.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.006","startPage":"76","endPage":"91","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Remaining time prediction for business processes with concurrency based on log representation","volume":"18","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remaining time prediction for business processes with concurrency based on log representation","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01743S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631183","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631184,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liang"},{"name":"Songyou Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China"],"firstName":"Songyou","lastName":"Xie"},{"name":"Jiahong Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China"],"firstName":"Jiahong","lastName":"Cai"},{"name":"Chong Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yujie Hong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Hong"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Kui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Kui"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631184","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel private data access control scheme suitable for mobile edge computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Encryption","Elliptic curve cryptography","Data privacy","Cloud computing","Costs","Blockchains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile edge computing (MEC)","privacy protection","access control","anonymous authentication"]}],"abstract":"Efficient response speed and information processing speed are among the characteristics of mobile edge computing (MEC). However, MEC easily causes information leakage and loss problems because it requires frequent data exchange. This work proposes an anonymous privacy data protection and access control scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and bilinear pairing to protect the communication security of the MEC. In the proposed scheme, the information sender encrypts private information through the ECC algorithm, and the information receiver uses its own key information and bilinear pairing to extract and verify the identity of the information sender. During each round of communication, the proposed scheme uses timestamps and random numbers to ensure the freshness of each round of conversation. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good security performance and can provide data privacy protection, integrity verification, and traceability for the communication process of MEC. The proposed scheme has a lower cost than other related schemes. The communication and computational cost of the proposed scheme are reduced by 31.08% and 22.31% on average compared with those of the other related schemes.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.007","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631184.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631184/","displayDocTitle":"Novel private data access control scheme suitable for mobile edge computing","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel private data access control scheme suitable for mobile edge computing","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016117S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631184","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631185,"authors":[{"name":"Han Xiao","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Zhiqin Wang","affiliation":["China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing 100191, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqin","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Wenqiang Tian","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Wenqiang","lastName":"Tian"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Liu","affiliation":["China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing 100191, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Wendong Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin"},{"name":"Jia Shen","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"Zhi Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Ning Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Standards Research, OPPO, Beijing 100026, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631185","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AI enlightens wireless communication: Analyses, solutions and opportunities on CSI feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Artificial intelligence","Receiving antennas","Data models","Transmitting antennas","Quantization (signal)","3GPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","CSI feedback","deep learning","data preprocessing","quantization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we give a systematic description of the 1st Wireless Communication Artificial Intelligence (AI) Competition (WAIC) which is hosted by IMT-2020(5G) Promotion Group 5G+AI Work Group.

In the proposed game, users act as leaders, chose their channel access strategies and transmit firstly. The tracking jammer acts as the follower, whose objective is to find the optimal jamming strategy at each time slot. Besides, the existence of Stackelberg equilibriums (SEs) is proved, which means users reach Nash Equilibriums (NEs) for each jamming strategy while the jammer finds its best response jamming strategy for the current network access case. An active attraction based anti-jamming channel access (3ACA) algorithm is designed to reach SEs, where jammed users keep their channel access strategies unchanged to create access chances for other users. To enhance the fairness of the system, users will adjust their strategies and re-learn after certain time slots to provide access chances for those users who sacrifice themselves to attract the tracking jammer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Put others before itself: A multi-leader one-follower anti-jamming stackelberg game against tracking jammer","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.012","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631189.pdf","publicationTitle":"China Communications","startPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631189","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Games","Vehicle dynamics","Optimization","Bayes methods","Wireless communication","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coordinated anti-jamming","channel access","Stackelberg game","tracking jammer","active attraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Put others before itself: A multi-leader one-follower anti-jamming stackelberg game against tracking jammer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Put others before itself: A multi-leader one-follower anti-jamming stackelberg game against tracking jammer","sourcePdf":"12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023485S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631189","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631190,"authors":[{"name":"Kaixin Cheng","affiliation":["The College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Kaixin","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["The College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University, Nanjing 210007, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Changhua Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

However, the sensing data obtained in actual environment is often not sufficient to accurately analyze the communication behavior. Traditional means can hardly utilize the scarce and crude spectrum sensing data captured in a real scene. Thus, communication behavior recognition using raw sensing data under small-sample condition has become a new challenge. In this paper, a data enhanced communication behavior recognition (DECBR) scheme is proposed to meet this challenge. Firstly, a preprocessing method is designed to make the raw spectrum data suitable for the proposed scheme. Then, an adaptive convolutional neural network structure is exploited to carry out communication behavior recognition. Moreover, DCGAN is applied to support data enhancement, which realize communication behavior recognition under small-sample condition. Finally, the scheme is verified by experiments under different data size. The results show that the DECBR scheme can greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of behavior recognition under small-sample condition.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.013","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631190.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631190/","displayDocTitle":"DCGAN based spectrum sensing data enhancement for behavior recognition in self-organized communication network","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCGAN based spectrum sensing data enhancement for behavior recognition in self-organized communication network","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021697S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631190","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631191,"authors":[{"name":"Liqin Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai 200438, China; Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems, Shanghai 200438, China; Computer Teaching and Research Section, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China"],"firstName":"Liqin","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Shanghai 200438, China; Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems, Shanghai 200438, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631191","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) contain evidence-based and economically reasonable medical treatment processes. Executable medical treatment processes in healthcare information systems can assist the treatment processes. To this end, business process modeling technologies have been exploited to model medical treatment processes. However, medical treatment processes are usually flexible and knowledge-intensive. To reduce the effort in modeling, we summarize several treatment patterns (i.e., frequent behaviors in medical treatment processes in CPGs), and represent them by three process modeling languages (i.e., BPMN, DMN, and CMMN). Based on the summarized treatment patterns, we propose a pattern-based integrated framework for modeling medical treatment processes. A modeling platform is implemented to support the use of treatment patterns, by which the feasibility of our approach is validated. An empirical analysis is discussed based on the coverage rates of treatment patterns. Feedback from interviewed physicians in a Chinese hospital shows that executable medical treatment processes of CPGs provide a convenient way to obtain guidance, thus assisting daily work for medical workers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On treatment patterns for modeling medical treatment processes in clinical practice guidelines","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.014","endPage":"209","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631191.pdf","publicationTitle":"China Communications","startPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical treatment","Medical diagnostic imaging","Task analysis","Guidelines","Medical services","Business","Process modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clinical practice guidelines","treatment patterns","process modeling","BPMN","DMN","CMMN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On treatment patterns for modeling medical treatment processes in clinical practice guidelines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On treatment patterns for modeling medical treatment processes in clinical practice guidelines","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016766S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631191","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631192,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar Gautam","affiliation":["Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur-273001, India"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Gautam"},{"name":"Rakesh Kumar","affiliation":["Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur-273001, India"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Kumar"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631192","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A key management scheme using (p, q)-lucas polynomials in wireless sensor network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Scalability","Network architecture","Energy efficiency","Data aggregation","Base stations","Routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["key management","lucas polynomial","WSN security","pairwise key distribution","key generation","hierarchical key management"]}],"abstract":"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has witnessed an unpredictable growth for the last few decades. It has many applications in various critical sectors such as real-time monitoring of nuclear power plant, disaster management, environment, military area etc. However, due to the distributed and remote deployment of sensor nodes in such networks, they are highly vulnerable to different security threats. The sensor network always needs a proficient key management scheme to secure data because of resource-constrained nodes. Existing polynomial based key management schemes are simple, but the computational complexity is a big issue. Lucas polynomials, Fibonacci polynomials, Chebychev polynomials are used in Engineering, Physics, Combinatory and Numerical analysis etc. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme using (p, q)-Lucas polynomial to improve the security of WSN. In (p, q)-Lucas polynomial, p represents a random base number while q represents a substitute value of \u00d7 in the polynomial. The value of p is unique, and q is different according to communication between nodes. Analysis of the proposed method on several parameters such as computational overhead, efficiency and storage cost have been performed and compared with existing related schemes. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed (p, q)-Lucas polynomial based key management scheme outperforms over other polynomials in terms of the number of keys used and efficiency.","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.015","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631192.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631192/","displayDocTitle":"A key management scheme using (p, q)-lucas polynomials in wireless sensor network","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A key management scheme using (p, q)-lucas polynomials in wireless sensor network","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01672S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631192","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631193,"authors":[{"name":"Guosheng Kang","affiliation":["Hunan Provincial Key Lab. for Services Computing and Novel Software Technology, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China; School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China"],"firstName":"Guosheng","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Liqing Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China"],"firstName":"Liqing","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Liang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Jianxun Liu","affiliation":["Hunan Provincial Key Lab. for Services Computing and Novel Software Technology, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China"],"firstName":"Jianxun","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Yiping Wen","affiliation":["Hunan Provincial Key Lab. for Services Computing and Novel Software Technology, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan 411201, China"],"firstName":"Yiping","lastName":"Wen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631193","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizations","Urban areas","Data models","Task analysis","Process modeling","Context modeling","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["S-BPM","configurable modeling","organization-driven","spatial variability","business objects","services"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Organization-driven business process configurable modeling for spatial variability","abstract":"Nowadays, enterprises need to continually adjust their business processes to adapt to the changes of business environments, especially when one business needs to be deployed in different application scenarios, which is called spatial variability in this paper. In the field of BPM (Business Process Management), configurable business process models have demonstrated their effectiveness in aspects of process modeling and model reuse. Yet, we found that the existing techniques lead to complex configurable models, and are inadequate for model reuse especially for the spatial variability issue because they neglect the root impact of organizations on control flow. S-BPM (Subject-oriented Business Process Management) models provide a solid foundation for dealing with complex applications and help to bridge the gap between business and IT for process execution. In this paper, we propose an organization-driven business process configurable modeling approach for spatial variability by integrating both restriction and extension operations based on the S-BPM paradigm, in which business objects are also included. Our approach is validated with a general business process developed for the Real Estate Administration (REA) in a certain province of China. The resulting configurable modeling framework can express the heterogeneous activity sequences for one business and has the potential to generate process models for uncertain environments in a new organization structure.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631193","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631193.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.016","startPage":"229","endPage":"242","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Organization-driven business process configurable modeling for spatial variability","volume":"18","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Organization-driven business process configurable modeling for spatial variability","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014876S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631193","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631194,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan 430000, China; Hubei Province Engineering Technology Research Center for Software Engineering, Wuhan 430000, China; Hubei Engineering Research Center for Smart Government and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan 430000, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Haifeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan 430000, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Junwei Ren","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan 430000, China"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Ren"},{"name":"Chaodong Wen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan 430000, China"],"firstName":"Chaodong","lastName":"Wen"},{"name":"Peng He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan 430000, China; Hubei Province Engineering Technology Research Center for Software Engineering, Wuhan 430000, China; Hubei Engineering Research Center for Smart Government and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan 430000, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"He"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631194","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Semantics","Insurance","Representation learning","Periodic structures","Internet","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graph embedding","hybrid recommendation","collaborative filtering","tagging"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid recommendation based on graph embedding","abstract":"In recent years, online reservation systems of country hotel have become increasingly popular in rural areas. How to accurately recommend the houses of country hotel to the users is an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming at the problem of cold start and data sparseness in recommendation, a Hybrid Recommendation method based on Graph Embedding (HRGE) is proposed. First, three types of network are built, including user-user network based on user tag, house-house network based on house tag, and user-user network based on user behavior. Then, by using the method of graph embedding, three types of network are respectively embedded into low-dimensional vectors to obtain the characterization vectors of nodes. Finally, these characterization vectors are used to make a hybrid recommendation. The datasets in this paper are derived from the Country Hotel Reservation System in Guizhou Province. The experimental results show that, compared with traditional recommendation algorithms, the comprehensive evaluation index (F1) of the HRGE is improved by 20% and the Mean Average Precision (MAP) is increased by 11%.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631194","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/9631174/09631194.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/JCC.2021.11.017","startPage":"243","endPage":"256","doi":"10.23919/JCC.2021.11.017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid recommendation based on graph embedding","volume":"18","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid recommendation based on graph embedding","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013126S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","isNumber":"9631174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"9631194","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9631195,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"9631195","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["6G mobile communication","Artificial intelligence","Wireless communication","Prototypes","Computer architecture","Ultra reliable low latency communication","Telecommunication computing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call for Paper","abstract":"With the rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as diversified applications (e.g., autonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality, space-air-ground integrated networks) with colorful demands, current networks (e.g., 4G and 5G networks) may not be well suited to the requirements of novel applications and services.

In this paper, an alternative problem, where the eavesdropping process is considered as a legal activity, will be analyzed to track suspicious communications. More specifically, we study a wireless surveillance system in which the legitimate monitor is equipped with multi-antenna to overhear the messages between the suspicious receiver and the suspicious transmitter. Suspicious users are grouped into pairs and use the NOMA technique to transmit signals to a suspicious base station. Meanwhile, the legitimate monitor (LM) simultaneously transmits jamming signals, listens to suspicious links, decode-and-forward (DF) the eavesdropped information to the legitimate eavesdropper (LE). Based on the proposed mechanism, we investigate the power allocation policies for jamming signals of the legitimate monitor under deterministic and non-deterministic interference channel. Accordingly, we derive the closed-form expression of the successful eavesdropping probability for the best and the worst user to evaluate the system performance. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to verify our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3131906","startPage":"168121","endPage":"168133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09631214.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Jamming in NOMA Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Jamming in NOMA Network","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2021","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9631214/","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631214/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Proactive Eavesdropping via Jamming in NOMA Network","sourcePdf":"access-phamhuu-3131906-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112816S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9631214","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":9631241,"authors":[{"name":"Van-Son Trinh","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9631241/trinh-3131819-small.gif","p":["Van-Son Trinh (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the Bachelor of Science degree from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2015.

However, most graphical neural networks consider the skeleton as a spatiotemporally uncorrelated graph and rely on a predetermined adjacency matrix, ignoring the spatiotemporal relevance of human actions and taking up significant computational costs. Meanwhile, the methods use graph convolution to focus too much on the neighboring nodes of the joints and ignore the totality of the action. In this work, we propose a lightweight but efficient neural network called NLB-ACSE based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our model consists of two large branches: non-local block branch that focuses on the long distance features and adaptive cross-spacetime edge branch that focuses on the short distance features. Both branches extract information across time and space, and focus on long and short information. Some simple but effective strategies also are applied to our model, such as semantics, maxpooling, and fusion inputs, which have small parameter burden but obtain a higher accuracy on ablation study. The proposed method with an order of magnitude smaller size than most previous papers is evaluated on three large datasets, NTU60, NTU120, and Northwesten-UCLA.

Over time, many anomaly detection techniques have been introduced. However, in general, they all suffer from the same problem: lack of data that represents anomalous behaviour. As anomalous behaviour is usually costly (or dangerous) for a system, it is difficult to gather enough data that represents such behaviour. This, in turn, makes it difficult to develop and evaluate anomaly detection techniques. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attracted much attention in anomaly detection research, due to their unique ability to generate new data. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature in this area, covering 128 papers. The goal of this review paper is to analyze the relation between anomaly detection techniques and types of GANs, to identify the most common application domains for GAN-assisted and GAN-based anomaly detection, and to assemble information on datasets and performance metrics used to assess them. Our study helps researchers and practitioners to find the most suitable GAN-assisted anomaly detection technique for their application. In addition, we present a research roadmap for future studies in this area. In summary, GANs are used in anomaly detection to address the problem of insufficient amount of data for the anomalous behaviour, either through data augmentation or representation learning. The most commonly used GAN architectures are DCGANs, standard GANs, and cGANs. The primary application domains include medicine, surveillance and intrusion detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631286/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks in Anomaly Detection: A Systematic Literature Review","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"ALLRP549804-19 and CRD543899-19"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100013200","fundingName":"Government of Alberta under Major Innovation Fund","grantNumber":"RCP-19-001-MIF"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks in Anomaly Detection: A Systematic Literature Review","sourcePdf":"access-sabuhi-3131949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.318423S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9631286","onlineDate":"30 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9631318,"authors":[{"name":"Mochamad Miftah Farid","affiliation":["Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani, Cimahi, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mochamad Miftah","lastName":"Farid"},{"name":"Esmeralda Contessa Djamal","affiliation":["Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani, Cimahi, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Esmeralda Contessa","lastName":"Djamal"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4264-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2330-4588"}],"articleNumber":"9631318","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patient monitoring","Computational modeling","Instruments","Stroke (medical condition)","Brain modeling","Feature extraction","Electroencephalography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG Signal","Wavelet Filter","CNN","post-stroke"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631318","abstract":"A stroke is a disruption of blood supply to the brain that leads to disability. Rehabilitation can reduce brain damage and other complications and also recover disability due to stroke. One instrument that can be used in post-stroke patients monitoring is Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signals are recorded from several channel pairs. So apart from maintaining signal sequences, handling time connectivity between channels is also essential. Therefore, the signal sequence and time connectivity between channels need to be handled simultaneously on two dimensions. The vertical dimension was the multi-channel dimension, and the horizontal dimension was the signal sequences of each channel concerning time. This research proposed the 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks method to identify post-stroke based on EEG signals. First, a wavelet filter was used to obtain a frequency range of 1\u201313 Hz to represent post-stroke patients. The identification results are one of the three levels of stroke, i.e., No Stroke, Minor Stroke, and Moderate Stroke. The experimental results show that 2D-CNN produced an accuracy of 94.99%, an increase of 8.32% from 1D-CNN, which obtained an accuracy of 86.67%.","doi":"10.1109/ICACSIS53237.2021.9631318","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACSIS53237.2021.9631318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631305","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631247/9631305/09631318.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-Stroke Identification of EEG Signal Using Wavelet Filters and 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631318/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Post-Stroke Identification of EEG Signal Using Wavelet Filters and 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9631318/","publicationDate":"23 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post-Stroke Identification of EEG Signal Using Wavelet Filters and 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Depok, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076522S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631247","isNumber":"9631305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631247","xplore-issue":"9631305","articleId":"9631318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9631456,"authors":[{"name":"Panteleimon Rodis","affiliation":["University of Macedonia, Greece"],"firstName":"Panteleimon","lastName":"Rodis","id":"37089192310"},{"name":"Panagiotis Papadimitriou","affiliation":["University of Macedonia, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Papadimitriou","id":"37074187800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2744-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2745-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-7389"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"9631456","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"abstract":"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) opens us great opportunities for network processing with higher resource efficiency and flexibility. Nevertheless, intelligent orchestration mechanisms are required, such that NFV can exploit its potential and fill up to its promise. In this respect, we investigate the potential gains of embracing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the virtual network function (VNF) placement problem. To this end, we design and evaluate a genetic algorithm, which seeks efficient embeddings with runtimes on par with heuristic methods. Our proposed embedding method exhibits innovations in terms of network representation and algorithm design, thereby, deviating from typical genetic algorithms. Compared to a heuristic, the proposed genetic algorithm yields higher request acceptance rates, stemming from more efficient resource utilization. We further study a range of factors and parameters that affect the efficiency of the genetic algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Intelligent networks","Runtime","Simulation","Reinforcement learning","Network function virtualization","Resource management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631456","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631377/9631248/09631456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Network Service Embedding using Genetic Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Network Service Embedding using Genetic Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631456/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"5 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631456/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Network Service Embedding using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570726903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100565S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631377","isNumber":"9631248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631377","xplore-issue":"9631248","articleId":"9631456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9631463,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Abidi","affiliation":["Innov'COM, Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Imen","lastName":"Abidi","id":"37086915513"},{"name":"Maha Cherif","affiliation":["Innov'COM, Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Maha","lastName":"Cherif","id":"37086657670"},{"name":"Moez Hizem","affiliation":["Innov'COM, Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Moez","lastName":"Hizem","id":"37399662900"},{"name":"Iness Ahriz","affiliation":["CEDRIC/ LAETITIA, CNAM, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Iness","lastName":"Ahriz","id":"37594676500"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["Innov'COM, Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37297081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2744-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2745-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-7389"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1530-1346"}],"articleNumber":"9631463","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631463","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Fading channels","High power amplifiers","Transmitters","System performance","Nonlinear distortion","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FNNs","HPA","SCMA","Nonlinear distortion compensation","Pre-distortion","Post-distortion"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631248","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MLP based on compensation method for the effects of High Power Amplifier N onlinearities in Non-Linear SCMA systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631377/9631248/09631463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631463","abstract":"As Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has proved to be a fascinating research in order to meet the requirements of future wireless communication systems. To reach high power efficiency, wireless communication systems are equipped with high power amplifiers (HPAs). In this paper, we investigate the effects of distortions due to high power amplifiers (HPA) nonlinearities. We study the performance of amplified SCMA systems, in terms of bit error rate (BER). Message passing algorithm (MPA) is considered for SCMA detectors. BER performance is derived and evaluated for Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results and comparisons are provided for several system parameters, such as the input back-off (IBO). Indeed, we propose a new distortion cancellation technique based on feed-forwarded neural networks (FNNs) to restore the system performance via eliminating the HPA nonlinearities at transmitter and receiver sides. It is confirmed that the proposed pre-distorter and post-distorter with neural network exhibit a good performance improvement of quality of the transmission. Specifically, post-distortion based on NNs shows a better BER performance, which is almost close to the one of the linear system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"5 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631463/","displayDocTitle":"A novel MLP based on compensation method for the effects of High Power Amplifier N onlinearities in Non-Linear SCMA systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MLP based on compensation method for the effects of High Power Amplifier N onlinearities in Non-Linear SCMA systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"1570733071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072774S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631377","isNumber":"9631248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631377","xplore-issue":"9631248","articleId":"9631463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9631567,"authors":[{"name":"Stepan Jezek","affiliation":["FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Stepan","lastName":"Jezek","id":"37089193340"},{"name":"Martin Jonak","affiliation":["FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jonak","id":"37086071705"},{"name":"Radim Burget","affiliation":["FEEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Radim","lastName":"Burget","id":"37666304800"},{"name":"Pavel Dvorak","affiliation":["Konica Minolta, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Dvorak","id":"37085473533"},{"name":"Milos Skotak","affiliation":["Konica Minolta, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Skotak","id":"37089192657"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0219-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0220-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"9631567","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9631567","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Image segmentation","Visualization","Metals","Production","Cameras","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["metal parts defectoscopy","visual defect detection","deep anomaly detection","neural networks","transfer learning","deep learning","automated optical inspection (AOI)"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection (AD) plays a key role in automated quality analysis in industrial production. Recent AD methods have shown great potential for the detection of visual defects in several real-world applications. Most of the datatsets used in AD research (e.g. MVTec AD) are composed mainly of images from the laboratory environment with a monochromatic background. Each image contains only one object, which is centred, and its distance and spatial orientation to the camera do not change significantly. However, these conditions cannot be achieved in many realworld manufacturing processes and production lines. In order to test the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) AD methods under conditions of variable spatial orientation, position and distance of multiple objects concerning the camera at different light intensities and with a non-homogeneous background, it is necessary to create a new dataset. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset focused specifically on the issue of defect detection during painted metal parts fabrication. Next, we evaluate the performance of current SOTA AD methods on the proposed dataset. Our results show that some SOTA AD methods, which perform well on the standard industrial anomaly detection datatset \u2013 MVTec AD, show significantly different performance on our dataset. AUROC image-level difference is up to 23.12%. If we average the scores for all methods on each dataset, we observe the difference of 15.24%. Our experiment shows that for further development and improvement of AD methods, it is necessary to test these methods on datasets based on specific real-world applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT54235.2021.9631567","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631553/9631559/09631567.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT54235.2021.9631567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning-based defect detection of metal parts: evaluating current methods in complex conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning-based defect detection of metal parts: evaluating current methods in complex conditions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631567/","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631567/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014809","fundingName":"Technology Agency of the Czech Republic","grantNumber":"FW03010273"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning-based defect detection of metal parts: evaluating current methods in complex conditions","confLoc":"Brno, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"p66-jezek.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161014S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631553","isNumber":"9631559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631553","xplore-issue":"9631559","articleId":"9631567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9631586,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqing Dong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, P.

In that context, large amount of labelled training data are required. However, labelling large scale occupancy data is time consuming and tedious since it requires the direct involvement of the users. To tackle this challenge, we consider a hybrid approach based on the recently introduced interactive learning methodology that allows to collect training data of good quality, by ensuring a minimal involvement of the user, and a classification approach that we have developed. The classification part is based on the predictive distribution of the generalized Dirichlet (GD) mixture model which unfortunately does not have a closed-form. To alleviate that issue, we calculate a reliable approximation to the predictive distribution by optimizing the parameters of GD posterior distribution by a Bayesian variational inference approach.

Extensive experimental results reported for both synthetic data and real data indicate that our method could achieve promising results especially with extremely small training data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631950/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid of Interactive Learning and Predictive Modeling for Occupancy Estimation in Smart Buildings","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61876068"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"EquipEx Program AmiQual4Home Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","grantNumber":"11-EQPX-00"},{"fundingName":"Cross Disciplinary Program Eco-SESA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid of Interactive Learning and Predictive Modeling for Occupancy Estimation in Smart Buildings","sourcePdf":"tce-bouguila-3131943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060574S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9631950","onlineDate":"01 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9631964,"authors":[{"name":"Moslem Heidarpur","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"firstName":"Moslem","lastName":"Heidarpur","orcid":"0000-0002-4116-0778","id":"37085531691"},{"name":"Mitra Mirhassani","affiliation":["University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"firstName":"Mitra","lastName":"Mirhassani","orcid":"0000-0001-8512-6427","id":"37294908800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9631964","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"In the above article \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n, in the title of the article, the acronym FPGA was incorrectly used as FGPA.

In contrast to the limitations of classical model order reduction approaches, commonly used to accelerate time-domain simulations, PINNs can universally approximate any continuous function with an arbitrary degree of accuracy. One of the novelties of this paper is that we avoid the need for any training data. We achieve this by incorporating the governing differential equations and an implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) integration scheme directly into the training process of the PINN; through this approach, PINNs can predict the trajectory of a dynamical power system at any discrete time step. The resulting Runge-Kutta-based physics-informed neural networks (RK-PINNs) can yield up to 100 times faster evaluations of the dynamics compared to standard time-domain simulations. We demonstrate the methodology on a single-machine infinite bus system governed by the swing equation. We show that RK-PINNs can accurately and quickly predict the solution trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9631995","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631985/9631986/09631995.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9631995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning without Data: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fast Time-Domain Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning without Data: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fast Time-Domain Simulation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631995/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012774","fundingName":"Innovation Fund Denmark","grantNumber":"6154-00020B"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"949899"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning without Data: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fast Time-Domain Simulation","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570738759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064101S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631985","isNumber":"9631986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631985","xplore-issue":"9631986","articleId":"9631995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9631998,"authors":[{"name":"Sheik M.

The normally distributed false data injection (FDI) attacks against the proposed distributed control are then designed for the distributed gener-ator's output voltage and active/reactive power measurements. In order to detect the presence of false measurements, a deep learning based attack detection strategy is further developed. The proposed attack detection is formulated as a multi-label classification problem to capture the inconsistency and co-occurrence dependencies in the power flow measurements due to the presence of FDI attacks. With this multi-label classification scheme, a single model is able to identify the presence of different attacks and load change simultaneously. Two different deep learning techniques are compared to design the attack detector, and the performance of the proposed distributed control and the attack detector is demonstrated through simulations on the modified IEEE 34-bus distribution test system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9631998","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631985/9631986/09631998.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"238","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9631998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Multi-Label Attack Detection for Distributed Control of AC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Multi-Label Attack Detection for Distributed Control of AC Microgrids","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9631998/","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9631998/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-2103426,OAC-2017597"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Multi-Label Attack Detection for Distributed Control of AC Microgrids","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570738839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11412S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631985","isNumber":"9631986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631985","xplore-issue":"9631986","articleId":"9631998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9632031,"authors":[{"name":"Messaoud Linani","affiliation":["Semiconductors and Functional Materials Laboratory, Laghouat University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Messaoud","lastName":"Linani","id":"37089184565"},{"name":"Bachir Mokhtari","affiliation":["LEDMASD Laboratory, Laghouat University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Bachir","lastName":"Mokhtari","id":"37089185323"},{"name":"Ali Cheknane","affiliation":["Semiconductors and Functional Materials Laboratory, Laghouat University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Cheknane","id":"37085697262"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3981-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3982-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9632031","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Costs","Temperature","Photovoltaic cells","Artificial neural networks","Solar energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar Irradiation","low-cost Pyranometer","Sensors","Photovoltaic Panel (PP)","Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","Electric vehicle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632031","abstract":"The detection of the flow of solar rays is very useful in applications that operate using solar energy.

Temperature is a crucial source of data on person\u2019s physical condition. The paper is devoted to developing an approach to ensure early breast cancer diagnosis by mapping temperature using machine learning techniques, using convolutional neural networks in particular. The novelty of our approach lies in studying the images drawn up based on temperature data obtained from local measurement points, with different color schemes used. Interpolation algorithms were used to improve the quality of the images obtained. The originality of the approach lies in the fact that, in addition to measuring real patients, computer modeling of mammary gland thermal fields is also used. We found that the use of extremely-accurate neural networks to diagnose breast cancers is an effective and viable approach. Even if few learning samples (192 examples) are available, our proposed algorithm shows roughly 80% high accuracy adjusted to the neural network topology and the color scheme applied. We also demonstrate the dependence of diagnosis quality on the number of source images used while training and testing. We have concluded that the combined use of the left and right mammary gland thermograms greatly improves diagnosis efficiency when using graphical image machine learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632053/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9632053/","publicationDate":"10 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Software to Process Medical Data Modeling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006769","fundingName":"Russian Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012190","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Software to Process Medical Data Modeling","confLoc":"Lipetsk, Russian Federation","sourcePdf":"0580-0585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071408S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631984","isNumber":"9632003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631984","xplore-issue":"9632003","articleId":"9632053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9632070,"authors":[{"name":"Liliya A.

According to the obtained results, the LSTM network trained with the chaotic Fish School Search algorithm with exponential step decay produces the most accurate predictions in the considered time series forecasting problems.","doi":"10.1109/SUMMA53307.2021.9632070","startPage":"473","endPage":"478","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Control Systems, Mathematical Modeling, Automation and Energy Efficiency (SUMMA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUMMA53307.2021.9632070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9632003","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Control Systems, Mathematical Modeling, Automation and Energy Efficiency (SUMMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631984/9632003/09632070.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Biology-inspired Algorithms Applied to Long Short-Term Memory Network Training for Time Series Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632070/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study of Biology-inspired Algorithms Applied to Long Short-Term Memory Network Training for Time Series Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9632070/","publicationDate":"10 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Biology-inspired Algorithms Applied to Long Short-Term Memory Network Training for Time Series Forecasting","confLoc":"Lipetsk, Russian Federation","sourcePdf":"0473-0478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059359S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631984","isNumber":"9632003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631984","xplore-issue":"9632003","articleId":"9632070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9632251,"authors":[{"name":"Artur Sagdatullin","affiliation":["Leninogorsk branch, Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N.Tupolev-KAI, Leninogorsk, Russia"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Sagdatullin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3981-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3982-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9632251","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632251","abstract":"The paper examines the features of various approaches to the construction of automatic control systems for technological objects in the production and transportation of oil.

Due to the intermittency and uncertainty characteristics of renewable generations in a general power system, the dynamic nature of multi-scale system features cannot be fully captured through the existing approaches. This further causes inaccurate prediction and ineffective system operation. To tackle this issue, we propose, in this paper, a deep learning approach to accurately predict the amount of frequency regulation reserves of a general power system through the consideration of network information and power reserves. First, we use the power flow model to generate the net active power imbalance, frequency regulation reserves, and power matrix of a general power system. Second, we combine multiple dynamic system features into a complete input dataset and perform data pre-processing before model training and testing. Third, the proposed deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) model is developed to accurately predict the net active power imbalance in the system, as well as predicting the frequency regulation reserves. Our simulation results show that, when considering the entire power network information, our proposed deep learning approach outperforms the four baseline techniques on predicting the frequency regulation reserves in a general power system. These promising results contribute to large economical benefits in power system operations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Renewable energy sources","Simulation","Power system dynamics","Power system stability","Predictive models","Smart grids"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9632284","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631985/9631986/09632284.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9632284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Frequency Regulation Reserve Prediction Based on Deep Learning Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Frequency Regulation Reserve Prediction Based on Deep Learning Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632284/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9632284/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Frequency Regulation Reserve Prediction Based on Deep Learning Approach","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570728690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07762S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631985","isNumber":"9631986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631985","xplore-issue":"9631986","articleId":"9632284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9632308,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Nellikkath","affiliation":["Center for Electric Power and Energy, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

This paper takes the first step and applies, for the first time to our knowledge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Worst-Case Guarantees for the DC Optimal Power Flow problem.

However, a critical challenge raised by the transportation electrification process is the proper planning of city-wide EV charging infrastructures, i.e., the siting and sizing of charging stations, especially for the cities that just start promoting the adoption of EVs. In this paper, we investigate the following problem: For a city with a limited budget for public EV charging infrastructure construction, where should the charging stations be deployed to promote the transition of EVs from traditional cars? We propose a \u03b4-nearest model that captures people's satisfaction towards a certain design and formulate the EV charging station placement problem as a monotone submodular maximization problem, equipped with gridded population data and trip data. We then propose a greedy-based algorithm to solve the problem efficiently with a provable approximation ratio. A case study using fine-grained Haikou population data, Point of Interest (POI) data, and trip data is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Urban areas","Sociology","Transportation","Charging stations","Approximation algorithms","Electric vehicle charging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9632309","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9631985/9631986/09632309.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9631986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm51999.2021.9632309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement for Incentivizing Potential Demand","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement for Incentivizing Potential Demand","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632309/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9632309/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement for Incentivizing Potential Demand","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570736698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080427S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9631985","isNumber":"9631986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9631985","xplore-issue":"9631986","articleId":"9632309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9632430,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Hasan","orcid":"0000-0002-5503-6823"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o M.

They behave in an analog manner, i.e., the input signal waveform remains unchanged through amplification. Therefore, they are usually characterized under a small-signal assumption. The other category collects saturated amplifiers, such as classes D, E, and F. They employ an active device that behaves as a quickly alternating on-off switch, like the one used in binary-logic circuits.

UAV-based person tracking is attracting incremental attention for its wide application requirements. Currently, some state-of-the-art visual tracking methods have achieved promising performance in common scenarios. However, in the scene of UAV-based person tracking, there will be long-term target disappearance and unpredictable dramatic target appearance changes, which still pose a huge challenge to UAV-based person tracking. In this work, a human-machine hybrid augmented tracking system based on eye tracking is proposed to cope with the challenge. During tracking, through the interaction between humans and machines, humans can provide real-time guidance and corrections to the tracker, and the tracker can also learn interesting targets from humans to enhance itself. The experimental results show that human-in-the-loop can remarkable improve the success rate and robustness of the tracking and our tracking system outperforms the state-of-the-art tracker in complex environments.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132077","startPage":"161181","endPage":"161193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

This paper presents a novel approach for the completion of missing harmonic data based on a data-driven approach. The idea is to construct an adjacency matrix and unconstrained optimization function through spectral graph theory, and construct an a priori information model of the target bus using the merging K-means algorithm. The augmented Lagrange iteration algorithm is used to iteratively solve the unconstrained optimization function, so to complete the missing harmonic data. In comparison with existing methods, this method reduces the data dependence between different phase measurement units and does not require the optimization strategy of phasor measurement units, which is suitable for single-phasor harmonic data completion. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method were verified using artificial and field data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9632546/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Method for Missing Harmonic Data Completion","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004912","fundingName":"Interdisciplinary Innovation Cultivate Project of Sichuan University","grantNumber":"0030304153003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Power System and Generation Equipment Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"SKLD21KM04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Driven Method for Missing Harmonic Data Completion","sourcePdf":"access-xu-3132152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124812S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9632546","onlineDate":"01 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9632551,"authors":[{"name":"Mort Naraghi-Pour","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9632551/narag-3132263-small.gif","p":["Mort Naraghi-Pour (Life Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1977, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1983 and 1987, respectively.

An algorithm based on expectation propagation (EP) is developed to iteratively approximate the joint a posteriori distribution of the unknown channel matrix and the transmitted data symbols with a distribution from an exponential family. This distribution is then used for direct estimation of the channel matrix and detection of data symbols. A modified version of the popular Kalman filtering algorithm referred to as KF-M is also proposed which emerges from our EP derivations. Performance of the Kalman smoothing algorithm followed by KF-M, referred here as KS-M, is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that channel estimation error and the symbol error rate (SER) of the semi-blind KF-M, KS-M, and EP-based algorithms improve with the increase in the number of base station antennas and the length of the data symbols in the transmitted frame. In particular, by increasing the number of transmitted data symbols in the frame, the proposed semi-blind algorithms can mitigate the effects of pilot contamination as well as time-varying channels in a multi-cell massive MIMO system with pilot-overhead of around 5%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09632551.pdf","startPage":"161709","endPage":"161722","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation and Data Detection for Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Systems on Time-Varying Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation and Data Detection for Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Systems on Time-Varying Channels","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9632551/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632551/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009068","fundingName":"Secretaria de Educaci\u00f3n Publica \u2013 Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (SEP-CONACyT) Research Projects","grantNumber":"255387 and 256237"},{"fundingName":"School of Engineering and Sciences and the Telecommunications Research Focus Group, Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey"},{"fundingName":"Mort Naraghi-Pour was on sabbatical leave at the School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation and Data Detection for Multi-Cell Massive MIMO Systems on Time-Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"access-naraghipour-3132263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103886S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9632551","onlineDate":"01 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9632561,"authors":[{"name":"Muhittin Bayram","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Dicle University, Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9632561/bayra-3132128-small.gif","p":["Muhittin Bayram received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey, in 1995, and the M.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Dicle University, Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey, in 2003, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering.","He is also a Research Assistant with the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Dicle University.

As part of this study, iEEG data obtained from epileptic subjects were first decomposed into their subbands by discrete wavelet transformation, and then Shannon entropy was applied to these five subbands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The results obtained made us observe that the delta subband entropy value is lower than other subband entropy values. A low entropy value means that the data is less chaotic.

However, traditional manual stool analysis processes are time-consuming and prone to human subjectivity errors that may lead to incorrect judgments. In this study, we employed deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically recognize and classify stools in macroscopic images. This approach is advantageous because it reduces the amount of direct interaction required by patients or medical staff, lowers the risk of cross-infection, and removes subjectivity in stool analysis. The U-Net segmentation model is applied to define the region of stools by generating a mask image. After combining the mask and the corresponding original image, the ResNeXt-50 classifies the pre-processed stool image according to the modified Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). Overall, the U-Net model yielded a mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of 93.75% and an F-score of 0.9570, as the ResNeXt-50 classifier had a classification accuracy of 94.35% and showed decent performance in terms of predictive power. Our study may help to improve the quality of diagnosis and monitoring of diseases associated with bowel movement habits by providing reliable measurements in terms of stool form and consistency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9632585/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and Classification of Human Stool Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81703956"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Detection and Classification of Human Stool Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","society":["IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Section"],"sourcePdf":"access-choy-3131982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114322S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9632585","onlineDate":"01 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9632678,"authors":[{"name":"Jonah Casebeer","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Jonah","lastName":"Casebeer","id":"37086455399"},{"name":"Nicholas J.

Such algorithms typically operate via specialized online, iterative optimization methods and have achieved tremendous success, but require expert knowledge, are slow to develop, and are difficult to customize. In our work, we present a new method to automatically learn adaptive filtering update rules directly from data. To do so, we frame adaptive filtering as a differentiable operator and train a learned optimizer to output a gradient descent-based update rule from data via backpropagation through time. We demonstrate our general approach on an acoustic echo cancellation task (single-talk with noise) and show that we can learn high-performing adaptive filters for a variety of common linear and non-linear mul-tidelayed block frequency domain filter architectures. We also find that our learned update rules exhibit fast convergence, can optimize in the presence of nonlinearities, and are robust to acoustic scene changes despite never encountering any during training.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9632678/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","publicationDate":"17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Auto-DSP: Learning to Optimize Acoustic Echo Cancellers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-DSP: Learning to Optimize Acoustic Echo Cancellers","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p291-casebeer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120613S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9632687","isNumber":"9632666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9632687","xplore-issue":"9632666","articleId":"9632678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9632772,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Salvati","affiliation":["Computer Science and Physics, University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Salvati"},{"name":"Carlo Drioli","affiliation":["Computer Science and Physics, University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Drioli"},{"name":"Gian Luca Foresti","affiliation":["Computer Science and Physics, University of Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian Luca","lastName":"Foresti"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4870-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4871-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1931-1168"}],"articleNumber":"9632772","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9632772","abstract":"A method to improve the localization of a sound source using a spherical microphone array embedded into autonomous systems is presented.

However, there are problems in the batik industry related to the labelling of traditional and modern batik products. The prevalence of fraud in printed batik, which is given a price equivalent to written batik, which is much more expensive, and public ignorance of the aesthetic value and authenticity of written batik, can disrupt the traditional batik industry in Indonesia. Based on these problems, the authors innovate to develop a machine learning model that aims to classify the authenticity of batik using the Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm with Transfer Learning Method. The classification process consists of several stages: collecting datasets, preprocessing data, developing CNN models with transfer learning, and compiling and training models. The development of the machine learning model that has been trained produces an accuracy of 96.91%.

This study presents a review of the existing CNN techniques used for malaria diagnosis, focusing on the architectures, data preparation, preprocessing, and classification. Furthermore, this study discusses why the comparability of the presented methods becomes difficult and which challenges must be overcome in the future. First, we review the current CNN approaches used for malaria classification from existing research articles. Next, the performance and properties of proposed CNN approaches are summarized and discussed. The use of CNN as a feature extractor shows better performance than transfer learning and learning from scratch approaches. Unfortunately, some research uses private datasets for training and testing the proposed model. Thus it is not easy to compare with the other methods. The use of CNN in malaria diagnosis is also still limited to binary classification, namely the normal and malaria-infected erythrocyte class. Future research should use available benchmark public datasets to allow the proposed CNN method comparability and proposed a CNN model for multi-class classification such as species and life stages of malaria-causing plasmodium.","doi":"10.1109/ICIC54025.2021.9632998","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2021 Sixth International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIC54025.2021.9632998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9632859","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Sixth International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9632864/9632859/09632998.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Malaria Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9632998/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Malaria Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network: A Review","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9632998/","publicationDate":"3 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Malaria Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network: A Review","confLoc":"Jakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ICIC2021_156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0964S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9632864","isNumber":"9632859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9632864","xplore-issue":"9632859","articleId":"9632998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9633047,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Leite Prates","affiliation":["Programa de Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo Leite","lastName":"Prates"},{"name":"Wilfrido G\u00f3mez-Flores","affiliation":["Cinvestav Tamaulipas, Ciudad Victoria, Mexico"],"firstName":"Wilfrido","lastName":"G\u00f3mez-Flores"},{"name":"Wagner Pereira","affiliation":["Programa de Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Wagner","lastName":"Pereira"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0029-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0030-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-3766"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2642-3774"}],"articleNumber":"9633047","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633047","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Solid modeling","Image segmentation","Computational modeling","Semantics","Muscles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mammography","Breast","Pectoral Muscle","Convolutional neural networks","Semantic segmentation","Transfer learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCE53527.2021.9633047","pdfPath":"/iel7/9632874/9632875/09633047.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 18th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 18th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9632875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCE53527.2021.9633047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Segmentation of Mammograms Using Pre-Trained Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"Anatomic regions like breast and pectoral muscle are common regions that need to be segmented before determining abnormalities in the mammographic image.

However, the employment of radio frequency (RF) signals for information/power transfer needs to comply with international health and safety regulations. In this article, we provide a complete framework for the design and analysis of far-field SWIPT under safety constraints. In particular, we deal with two RF exposure regulations, namely, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and the maximum permissible exposure (MPE). The state of the art regarding SAR and MPE is outlined together with a description as to how these can be modeled in the context of communication networks. We propose a deep learning approach for the design of robust beamforming subject to specific information, energy harvesting, and SAR constraints. Furthermore, we present a thorough analytical study for the performance of large-scale SWIPT systems, in terms of information and energy coverage under MPE constraints. This work provides insights with regards to the optimal SWIPT design and the potentials from the proper development of SWIPT systems under health and safety restrictions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Safety","Regulation","Receivers","Radiofrequency exposure","Specific absorption rate","Wireless power transfer","Energy harvesting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum permissible exposure (MPE)","safety regulations","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","specific absorption rate (SAR)","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3130084","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9675003/09633129.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3130084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of SWIPT With Safety Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633129","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of SWIPT With Safety Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633129/","volume":"110","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9633129/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"819819 (APOLLO)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61901317"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB190104"},{"fundingName":"Joint Education Project between China and Central-Eastern European Countries","grantNumber":"202005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/N007840/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of SWIPT With Safety Constraints","sourcePdf":"jproc-psomas-3130084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10887S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9633129","onlineDate":"02 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9633194,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Gaglione","affiliation":["NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Gaglione","orcid":"0000-0001-7401-1659"},{"name":"Paolo Braca","affiliation":["NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Braca","orcid":"0000-0002-3762-4373"},{"name":"Giovanni Soldi","affiliation":["NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, La Spezia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Soldi","orcid":"0000-0003-4426-7850"},{"name":"Florian Meyer","affiliation":["Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Meyer","orcid":"0000-0001-6985-2250"},{"name":"Franz Hlawatsch","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Hlawatsch","orcid":"0000-0001-9010-9285"},{"name":"Moe Z.

Here, we develop a statistical model and algorithm for tracking an unknown number of targets based on the probabilistic fusion of observations from two classes of data sources. The first class, referred to as target-independent perception systems (TIPSs), consists of sensors that periodically produce noisy measurements of targets without requiring target cooperation. The second class, referred to as target-dependent reporting systems (TDRSs), relies on cooperative targets that report noisy measurements of their state and their identity. We present a joint TIPS\u2013TDRS observation model that accounts for observation-origin uncertainty, missed detections, false alarms, and asynchronicity. We then establish a factor graph that represents this observation model along with a state evolution model including target identities. Finally, by executing the sum-product algorithm on that factor graph, we obtain a scalable multitarget tracking algorithm with inherent TIPS\u2013TDRS fusion. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulated data as well as real data from a maritime surveillance experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3132232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3132232","startPage":"322","endPage":"336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09633194.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Sensor Measurements and Target-Provided Information in Multitarget Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Sensor Measurements and Target-Provided Information in Multitarget Tracking","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633194/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633194/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NATO Allied Command Transformation"},{"fundingName":"DKOE Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002428","fundingName":"Austrian Science Fund","grantNumber":"P 32055-N31"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001824","fundingName":"Grantov\u00e1 Agentura \u010cesk\u00e9 Republiky","grantNumber":"17-19638S"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-21-1-2267"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office"},{"fundingName":"MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies","grantNumber":"W911NF-13-D-0001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Sensor Measurements and Target-Provided Information in Multitarget Tracking","sourcePdf":"tsp-gaglione-3132232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108342S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9633194","onlineDate":"02 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":9633213,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Li","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9633213/li-3132277-small.gif","p":["Kan Li (Member, IEEE) received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, USA, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2015.

Unlike existing nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter where the system dynamics are assumed known, the state-space representation for the Functional Bayesian Filter (FBF) is completely learned online from measurement data in the form of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter or recurrent network in the RKHS, with universal approximation property. Using a positive definite kernel function satisfying Mercer\u2019s conditions to compute and evolve information quantities, the FBF exploits both the statistical and time-domain information about the signal, extracts higher-order moments, and preserves the properties of covariances without the ill effects due to conventional arithmetic operations. We apply this novel kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) to recurrent network training, chaotic time-series estimation and cooperative filtering using Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises, and inverse kinematics modeling.

Then, we obtain the MMC dynamics for analysis and control and finally, we implement a numerical simulation validating the claims and advantages of the proposed study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Multilevel converters","Perturbation methods","Process control","Numerical simulation","Stability analysis","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven modeling","Koopman operator","Multilevel converters","Nonlinear control","System identification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCAC51819.2021.9633292","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 5th Colombian Conference on Automatic Control (CCAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 5th Colombian Conference on Automatic Control (CCAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633214/9633263/09633292.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAC51819.2021.9633292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contraction-based Controller for a MMC Based on Data-Driven Nonlinear Identification with Noisy Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contraction-based Controller for a MMC Based on Data-Driven Nonlinear Identification with Noisy Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633292/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9633292/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contraction-based Controller for a MMC Based on Data-Driven Nonlinear Identification with Noisy Data","confLoc":"Ibague, Colombia","sourcePdf":"51_2021246041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087984S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633214","isNumber":"9633263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633214","xplore-issue":"9633263","articleId":"9633292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9633294,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Noriega","affiliation":["Grupo de Estudio y Desarrollo, Universidad Santo Tomas, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Noriega"},{"name":"Juan P.

The most commonly used type of generator, the doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbine (DFIG-WT), is highly susceptible to grid voltage disturbances. The topology depicts a WT that is connected to an electric grid and uses DVR. DVR is a series interface method coupled to DFIG-WT, to resolve the voltage issue and conform with WT's FRT capability. Since DVR can provide quick voltage sag mitigation during faults, help ride through capability, and boost grid power quality with integrated wind generators, it is a good fit for grid operations. The control algorithm used defines the solution\u2019s effectiveness in overcoming most grid faults. The use of combined feed forward and feedback control based on neural network control to increase DVR performance is investigated in this research in terms of DC connection voltage balancing, active and reactive power assistance, mitigation of voltage sag and for DFIG WT\u2019s FRT capability when there is a balanced sag and short circuit fault condition. The DVR\u2019s operation, with the ability of this control to compensate for sag and regulate load voltage to the best of its ability is confirmed by findings from a 1.5 MW grid- connected DFIG WT MATLAB simulation.","doi":"10.1109/RDCAPE52977.2021.9633350","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Recent Developments in Control, Automation & Power Engineering (RDCAPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633337/9633345/09633350.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Recent Developments in Control, Automation & Power Engineering (RDCAPE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RDCAPE52977.2021.9633350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFIG-based wind turbine using DVR with neural network control for augmentation of Fault ride through","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","PI control","Power quality","Neural networks","Doubly fed induction generators","Generators","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFIG","DVR","RSC","GSC","FRT","LVRT","ANN control","Voltage Sag","CFFFB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"DFIG-based wind turbine using DVR with neural network control for augmentation of Fault ride through","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633350/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFIG-based wind turbine using DVR with neural network control for augmentation of Fault ride through","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04517S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633337","isNumber":"9633345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633337","xplore-issue":"9633345","articleId":"9633350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9633395,"authors":[{"name":"Latha Maheswari Kandasamy","affiliation":["PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Latha Maheswari","lastName":"Kandasamy"},{"name":"Jaganathan Kanakaraj","affiliation":["PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Jaganathan","lastName":"Kanakaraj"},{"name":"Suvedhitha J","affiliation":["PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Suvedhitha","lastName":"J"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1429-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1430-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633395","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Renewable energy sources","Voltage source inverters","Software packages","Microgrids","Artificial neural networks","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage Source Inverters (VSI)","Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","Distributed Generation (DG)","Microgrid","Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)","Grid-Tied Inverter (GTI)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633395","abstract":"The exponential use of Distributed Generation (DG) resources such as solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources is owing to global climate change and an increase in electric demand. Microgrids comprise many parallel-connected distributed generations (DG) units that use coordinated control techniques and may operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes. In order to integrate renewable energy resources into the electrical grid, three-phase Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) are essential. Traditional linear control approaches used in VSI have a high sensitivity to parameter changes and delayed transient response, resulting in large oscillations in the microgrid frequency and voltage. In recent years, innovative control methods for power converters in microgrids have been successfully developed as replacements for traditional cascaded linear controllers. This paper introduces an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based controller that compensates for primary frequency and voltage variations faster than the current state-of-the-art methods. The complete converter circuit model is designed and simulated using MATLAB software to obtain a dataset with various load conditions. The ANN-based controller was designed, trained, and tested in a Google collaboration environment. It auto-tunes the model based on the output parameters obtained from MATLAB, improving the system's overall performance. The simulation results suggest that the ANN-based controller outperforms the traditional controller in terms of performance and is more suited for AC Microgrid control.","doi":"10.1109/RDCAPE52977.2021.9633395","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Recent Developments in Control, Automation & Power Engineering (RDCAPE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RDCAPE52977.2021.9633395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633345","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Recent Developments in Control, Automation & Power Engineering (RDCAPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633337/9633345/09633395.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Based Intelligent Controller Design for Grid-Tied Inverters of Microgrid under Load Variation and Disturbance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633395/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Based Intelligent Controller Design for Grid-Tied Inverters of Microgrid under Load Variation and Disturbance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633395/","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Based Intelligent Controller Design for Grid-Tied Inverters of Microgrid under Load Variation and Disturbance","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112865S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633337","isNumber":"9633345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633337","xplore-issue":"9633345","articleId":"9633395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9633427,"authors":[{"name":"Amal NN","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India"],"firstName":"Amal","lastName":"NN","id":"37089187958"},{"name":"TK Sunil Kumar","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India"],"firstName":"TK Sunil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37089187202"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1429-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1430-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633427","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power engineering","Nonlinear equations","Design methodology","Delay effects","Neural networks","Transfer functions","Process control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AGTM","NNA","2-DOF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633427","abstract":"This paper proposes a 2-DOF fractional order controller design method for a plant to match its response with that of the reference model where both having different time delays.

The maintenance of the airport runway has become an important issue. The government invests a lot of money to maintain airport runway every year. Therefore, detecting cracks on the surface of the runway is very important to reduce maintenance costs and ensure safety. In view of the poor real-time performance of traditional runway crack detection and the long time-consuming manual inspection. We proposed a runway crack detection method based on YOLOv5, and annotated 3281 collected data sets. Finally, we use the YOLOv5 model with different parameters for training to obtain the optimal weight file and test it. Compare and analyze with several other classic machine learning models. The experimental results show that the yolov5 algorithm can effectively detect and identify airport runway cracks, and compared with traditional identification methods, the crack detection accuracy is also improved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633666","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633338/9633343/09633666.pdf","startPage":"1252","endPage":"1255","doi":"10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runway Crack Detection Based on YOLOV5","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Runway Crack Detection Based on YOLOV5","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9633666/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633666/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runway Crack Detection Based on YOLOV5","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"AT504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064101S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633338","isNumber":"9633343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633338","xplore-issue":"9633343","articleId":"9633666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":9633683,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Yanbin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanbin","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2518-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2517-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2519-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633683","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633683","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Speech recognition","Market research","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition","Deep learning","Neural network","CiteSpace","Bibliometric","Visual map"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633683","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633338/9633343/09633683.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","startPage":"587","endPage":"596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research progress and trend analysis of speech recognition technology using CiteSpace and computer neural network","abstract":"Speech recognition as a natural way of humancomputer interaction has been gradually applied to People's Daily life.

The proposed GAN-based demodulation network uses the confrontation characteristics between the generator and the discriminator in GAN to greatly improve the demodulation ability of the signal. Numerical results show that the demodulation performance is better than the coherent demodulation algorithm and the CNN-based demodulation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633741","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1150","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633338/9633343/09633741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Civil Aviation Safety and Information Technology (ICCASIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Signal Demodulation Algorithm Based on Generative Adversarial Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Tensors","Neural networks","Generative adversarial networks","Generators","Safety","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["generative adversarial networks","signal demodulation","convolutional neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Signal Demodulation Algorithm Based on Generative Adversarial Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633741/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Signal Demodulation Algorithm Based on Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"AT448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053138S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633338","isNumber":"9633343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633338","xplore-issue":"9633343","articleId":"9633741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9633780,"authors":[{"name":"Ruizhi Hun","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASICampers & System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ruizhi","lastName":"Hun"},{"name":"Song Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASICampers & System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Gurjeet Singh","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA"],"firstName":"Gurjeet","lastName":"Singh"},{"name":"Jian Qian","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASICampers & System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Qian"},{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASICampers & System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Patrick Yin Chiang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ASICampers & System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Patrick Yin","lastName":"Chiang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3879-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3878-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4606-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633780","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Recurrent neural networks","Computational modeling","Transfer learning","Estimation","Training data","Transformers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["State of charge","deep learning","self-attention","transfer learning","Transformer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPIES52282.2021.9633780","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633339/9633770/09633780.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIES52282.2021.9633780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LISA: A Transferable Light-weight Multi-Head Self-Attention Neural Network Model for Lithium-Ion Batteries State-of-Charge Estimation","abstract":"Deep learning has drawn wide attention in state-of-charge (SOC) estimation for batteries in electric vehicles, owning to its model-free feature and powerful ability of nonlinear regression. However, previous studies focused on improving estimation accuracy, with less research devoted to computational efficiency and hardware implementation. This paper proposes a light-weight multi-head self-attention neural network with only 298 trainable parameters and 1.18K floating point operations (FLOPs), while achieving 2.10% RMSE at all conditions. This proposed self-attention and simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can operate independently in the battery model, and can be greatly accelerated by on-chip parallel execution. Furthermore, a transfer learning (TL) method was applied to the proposed model. The proposed model with transfer learning performs significantly better on small training subsets and stopped with fewer epochs using an early stopping strategy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first model using Transformer and self-attention for SOC estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633780/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633780/","publicationDate":"25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LISA: A Transferable Light-weight Multi-Head Self-Attention Neural Network Model for Lithium-Ion Batteries State-of-Charge Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LISA: A Transferable Light-weight Multi-Head Self-Attention Neural Network Model for Lithium-Ion Batteries State-of-Charge Estimation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057778S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633339","isNumber":"9633770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633339","xplore-issue":"9633770","articleId":"9633780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9633812,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Liu","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085338742"},{"name":"Xutong Hou","affiliation":["College of Electric Engineering Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xutong","lastName":"Hou","id":"37089186012"},{"name":"Chengbin Zhao","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chengbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37089186668"},{"name":"Liang Ji","affiliation":["College of Electric Engineering Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085491701"},{"name":"Shuxin Tian","affiliation":["College of Electric Engineering Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shuxin","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085482224"},{"name":"Xiangjing Su","affiliation":["College of Electric Engineering Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjing","lastName":"Su","id":"38520005900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3879-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3878-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4606-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633812","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy","Stability criteria","Distribution networks","Power system stability","Iterative algorithms","Power system reliability","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault recovery","distribution network","reference vector","preferred area"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPIES52282.2021.9633812","pdfPath":"/iel7/9633339/9633770/09633812.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems (SPIES)","startPage":"272","endPage":"277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9633770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIES52282.2021.9633812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fault Recovery Strategy for Future Distribution Network based on Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"Fault recovery strategy plays a vital role in increasing the power system reliability and stability. The classic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on Pareto dominance criteria and crowding distance sorting method does not consider the preference of decision maker in the iterative process, which leads to the decline of convergence performance. For the problem, this paper proposes a novel fault recovery strategy based on the preference multi-objective particle swarm algorithm considering the reference vector. This method uses the reference vector to determine the preference area so as to effectively integrate the decision maker\u2019s preference knowledge into the fault recovery plan design. As the multi-objective intelligence algorithm based on Pareto dominance does not consider the problem of decision-makers\u2019 preference knowledge, the multi-objective discrete binary particle swarm algorithm is then introduced. Secondly, the individual solutions are selected through the v-dominance relationship according to the preferences of decision makers, and external files are maintained. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through the 69-node distribution network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9633812/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9633812/","publicationDate":"25 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fault Recovery Strategy for Future Distribution Network based on Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fault Recovery Strategy for Future Distribution Network based on Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"08-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051733S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9633339","isNumber":"9633770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9633339","xplore-issue":"9633770","articleId":"9633812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9633912,"authors":[{"name":"Lahiru Aththanayake","affiliation":["School of Engineering, SEBE, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Lahiru","lastName":"Aththanayake"},{"name":"Apel Mahmud","affiliation":["Centre for Smart Power and Energy Research, School of Engineering, SEBE, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Apel","lastName":"Mahmud"},{"name":"Nasser Hosseinzadeh","affiliation":["Centre for Smart Power and Energy Research, School of Engineering, SEBE, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Hosseinzadeh"},{"name":"Ameen Gargoom","affiliation":["Centre for Smart Power and Energy Research, School of Engineering, SEBE, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Ameen","lastName":"Gargoom"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3879-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3878-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4606-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9633912","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Support vector machines","Simulation","Power system dynamics","Linear regression","Artificial neural networks","Machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power system dynamic model reduction","stability","artificial neural network","regression","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9633912","abstract":"The performance of regression and artificial neural network schemes is evaluated for dynamic model reduction of power systems.

All simulations are based on a simplified Australian 14 Generator model. Datasets for training and test sets are obtained by measuring boundary bus properties and power flowing through tie lines. The simulation results show that the artificial neural network outperforms the regression models in making a reduced model of the power system, but only related to the system responses corresponding to the contingencies that were used for training. However, they perform poorly for unknown contingencies.

We argue that the most common THz NOMA configuration is power-domain superposition coding over quasi-optical doubly-massive MIMO channels. We propose spatial tuning techniques that modify antenna subarray arrangements to enhance channel conditions. Towards recovering the superposed data at the receiver side, we propose a family of data detectors based on low-complexity channel matrix puncturing, in which higher-order detectors are dynamically formed from lower-order component detectors. The proposed solutions are first detailed for the case of superposition coding of multiple streams in point-to-point THz MIMO links. Then, the study is extended to multi-user NOMA, in which randomly distributed users get grouped into narrow cell sectors and are allocated different power levels depending on their proximity to the base station. Successive interference cancelation is shown to be carried with minimal performance and complexity costs under spatial tuning. Approximate bit error rate (BER) equations are derived, and an architectural design is proposed to illustrate complexity reductions. Under typical THz conditions, channel puncturing introduces more than an order of magnitude reduction in BER at high signal-to-noise ratios while reducing complexity by approximately 90%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Detectors","MIMO communication","Array signal processing","Silicon carbide","Resource management","Baseband"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["THz communications","NOMA","UM-MIMO","subspace detectors","channel puncturing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3131769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09634116.pdf","startPage":"2628","endPage":"2644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3131769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz-Band MIMO-NOMA: Adaptive Superposition Coding and Subspace Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Terahertz-Band MIMO-NOMA: Adaptive Superposition Coding and Subspace Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634116/","volume":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9634116/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Office of Sponsored Research (OSR)","grantNumber":"ORA-CRG2021-4695"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Terahertz-Band MIMO-NOMA: Adaptive Superposition Coding and Subspace Detection","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-sarieddeen-3131769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106592S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9634116","onlineDate":"03 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":9634125,"authors":[{"name":"Rezi Delfianti","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rezi","lastName":"Delfianti"},{"name":"Ontoseno Penangsang","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ontoseno","lastName":"Penangsang"},{"name":"Adi Soeprijanto","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adi","lastName":"Soeprijanto"},{"name":"Nasyith Hananur Rohiem","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nasyith Hananur","lastName":"Rohiem"},{"name":"Novian Patria Uman Putra","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Novian Patria Uman","lastName":"Putra"},{"name":"Titiek Suheta","affiliation":["Institute Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Titiek","lastName":"Suheta"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4293-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4294-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634125","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634125","abstract":"One of the most critical aspects of power system research is voltage stability. One solution for maintaining the power factor value in compliance with the set of specifications and producing a voltage value that meets the device requirements determines the size and placement of capacitor banks. Changing load demand necessitates the use of capacitor banks to be switched on or off. The most critical aspect in achieving optimum capacitor bank utilization is the switching arrangement. The Particle swarm optimization algorithm is used in this study to determine the size, placement, and switching on or off the capacitor banks in the Surabaya distribution system. The switching will be easier if the capacitor banks required at specific hours can be minimized. Therefore, we can extend the capacitor bank's lifetime and optimize its usage. Besides, switching on or off the capacitor banks will increase the quality of voltage and provide pricing efficiency. This study is a simulation carried out with the aid of Matlab Software.","doi":"10.1109/JEEIT53412.2021.9634125","startPage":"245","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9634103/9634090/09634125.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEEIT53412.2021.9634125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Scheduling Of Capacitor Bank Switching To Improve Voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Costs","Heuristic algorithms","Capacitors","Software algorithms","Switches","Voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sizing and placement","capacitor bank","switching","PSO algorithm","voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Scheduling Of Capacitor Bank Switching To Improve Voltage","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9634125/","publicationDate":"16 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Scheduling Of Capacitor Bank Switching To Improve Voltage","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0554S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634103","isNumber":"9634090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634103","xplore-issue":"9634090","articleId":"9634125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9634126,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad N.

While SAR ADC is a popular choice for a low-power ADC in advanced CMOS processes, the input capacitance $(\\mathrm{C}_{in})$ presented by the front-end capacitive DAC (CDAC) to the ADC input limits achievable signal bandwidth. In contrast, pipelined SAR ADCs has more freedom in choosing C\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in</inf>\n because the resolution of the 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n stage CDAC can be much lower than the total resolution.

The downside of the pipelined SAR ADCs is the necessity of a residue amplifier, which often dominates the total power consumption. One can consider using a dynamic amplifier (DA) as a residue amplifier because achieving both high speed and low power is possible when the desired gain is modest [1\u20132]. Being an open-loop and fully-dynamic, however, the DA suffers from the gain inaccuracy and is vulnerable to the kickback noise. Furthermore, the gain varies significantly over process and temperature. [3] and [4] attempt to solve this issue by temperature-tracking bias but such compensation method requires off-chip and temperature-dependent voltage or resistor to tune the process uncertainty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9634748/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","publicationDate":"7 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"1.55mW 2GHz ERBW 7b 800MS/s 3-stage Pipelined SAR ADC in 28nm CMOS using a Kickback-Cancelling 7T-Dynamic Residue Amplifier with only 16fF Input Capacitance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1.55mW 2GHz ERBW 7b 800MS/s 3-stage Pipelined SAR ADC in 28nm CMOS using a Kickback-Cancelling 7T-Dynamic Residue Amplifier with only 16fF Input Capacitance","confLoc":"Busan, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"S10_4_3228_.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041876S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634699","isNumber":"9634177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634699","xplore-issue":"9634177","articleId":"9634748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9634804,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086536775"},{"name":"Xueli Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089185278"},{"name":"Peng Cao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cao","id":"38542174600"},{"name":"Tingting Wei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Wei","id":"37089189421"},{"name":"Zhiguo Tong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Tong","id":"37088698180"},{"name":"Jiawei Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37089184262"},{"name":"Zhiliang Hong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276342300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4350-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4351-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634804","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Modulation","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Voltage","Peak to average power ratio","Throughput"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634804","doi":"10.1109/A-SSCC53895.2021.9634804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/A-SSCC53895.2021.9634804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634177","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference (A-SSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference (A-SSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9634699/9634177/09634804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2.7W AC-coupled hybrid supply modulator achieving 200MHz envelope-tracking bandwidth for 5G new radio power amplifier","abstract":"Modern wireless communication system especially the 5G needs much higher throughput, which requires wide channel bandwidth and high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) envelope. This kind of signal seriously deteriorates the efficiency of power amplifier (PA). Envelope tracking (ET) is an effective way to maximize the efficiency of PA which should be operated in the power back-off region for linearity. It has been commercialized since 4G LTE era and is also being employed in 5G NR handsets [1]. The prior art envelope tracking supply modulators (ETSM) rely on the hybrid architecture, i.e. a wideband linear amplifier (LA) and a low-loss switching power modulator (SPM), to improve power efficiency. The AC-coupled hybrid ETSM [1], 3, [4] filters the DC envelope signal, leaving only the AC component to the LA. Hence, the supply voltage of the LA can be lower than the peak envelope voltage for higher efficiency. On the other hand, the bandwidth of the ETSMs is often limited to 40MHz-130MHz [1]\u2013[4]. An even higher bandwidth to accommodate 5G New Radio (NR) remains a bottleneck because of the large output capacitor introduced by PA. A recently reported ETSM [5] achieves 200MHz bandwidth but with a rather ideal resistive load of $5 \\Omega$. In this paper, the ETSM is loaded with a more realistic PA model of $4 \\Omega //600$ pF. By utilizing diverse circuit techniques, the proposed ETSM achieves 200MHz bandwidth with 78.5% peak efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9634804/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","publicationDate":"7 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 2.7W AC-coupled hybrid supply modulator achieving 200MHz envelope-tracking bandwidth for 5G new radio power amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2.7W AC-coupled hybrid supply modulator achieving 200MHz envelope-tracking bandwidth for 5G new radio power amplifier","confLoc":"Busan, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"S18_4_3078_.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040461S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634699","isNumber":"9634177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634699","xplore-issue":"9634177","articleId":"9634804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9634810,"authors":[{"name":"Wooyoung Jo","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Wooyoung","lastName":"Jo","id":"37088634533"},{"name":"Juhyoung Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Juhyoung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086042503"},{"name":"Seunghyun Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Seunghyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37089183559"},{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Hoi-Jun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37089188597"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4350-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4351-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634810","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning FPGA Accelerator for Online Fast Adaptation with Selective Mixed-precision Re-training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634810","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Performance evaluation","Deep learning","Conferences","Robot control","Decision making","Reinforcement learning"]}],"abstract":"Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown human-level performances in sequential decision-making problems including a gaming agent and robot control [1].

It consists of a DRL agent, a replay buffer, and the environment. Unlike traditional deep learning which requires labeled data, DRL training utilizes experiences stored in the replay buffer. The stored experiences are generated by repetitive interaction between the DRL agent and the environment.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most popular meta-heuristic combinatorial optimization algorithms, which has been widely used for various optimization problems including network route optimization. In this study, we demonstrated how to find an optimized network path between designated source and destination in a given network with 95 nodes and 200 links using the GA. Our result shows that the GA with the lower mutation probability for reducing the wasteful search space is a comprehensive approach in this study in terms of computational challenges and routing optimization. Our investigation concludes that the GA is an efficient and alternative method of finding an optimal route so as to achieve the desired network performance and to reduce congestion control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634870/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9634870/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Proposal of Large Scale Network Route Optimization Technique Based on Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposal of Large Scale Network Route Optimization Technique Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Lijiang City, China","sourcePdf":"415800a265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052308S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634858","isNumber":"9634859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634858","xplore-issue":"9634859","articleId":"9634870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9634889,"authors":[{"name":"Wendi Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wendi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37089185066"},{"name":"Xiaoying Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085797210"},{"name":"Kechen Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kechen","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085359644"},{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xu","id":"38194996800"},{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China","Center for Cybersecurity Research and Development, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089188992"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4158-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4159-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634889","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Radio transmitters","Markov processes","Sensors","Energy harvesting","Data communication","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio network","spectrum sensing","multi-channel","energy harvesting","spectrum utilization efficiency","Markov decision process"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the dilemma in the multi-channel spectrum sensing by the multi-antenna user, this paper focuses on the scheme of spectrum sensing and energy harvesting to coordinate the time scheduling and energy management in the cognitive radio networks (CRNs), where a secondary transmitter (ST) exploits spectrum holes to transmit data through multichannel. To improve spectrum utilization efficiency, we investigate how the ST selects channels for sensing based on the residual energy, and adjusts the time scheduling of energy harvesting and data transmission with respect to the sensing results. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive scheme concerning spectrum sensing, channel selection, energy harvesting, and data transmission (SCED) for the ST. Moreover, we formulate the optimization of spectrum utilization efficiency as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem, which is challenging due to the system space and action space. Furthermore, we solve the MDP problem by a proposed value iteration algorithm. Numerical results show that the spectrum utilization efficiency under the SCED scheme is better than that under other schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaNA53684.2021.00009","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9634858/9634859/09634889.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/NaNA53684.2021.00009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Utilization Improvement for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Utilization Improvement for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9634889/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Utilization Improvement for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks with Energy Harvesting","confLoc":"Lijiang City, China","sourcePdf":"415800a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065411S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634858","isNumber":"9634859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634858","xplore-issue":"9634859","articleId":"9634889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9634902,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihui Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\u2019an, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Modem Teaching Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089184006"},{"name":"Jianrui Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\u2019an, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Modem Teaching Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jianrui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086688595"},{"name":"Peijie Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\u2019an, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Modem Teaching Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Peijie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089189349"},{"name":"Tingting Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\u2019an, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Modem Teaching Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Tingting","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37089188802"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4158-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4159-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634902","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9634902","abstract":"Graph convolutional network (GCN) and dynamic evolutionary model are the mainstream collaborative filtering technologies in recent years. Nevertheless, the initial feature vectors selection problem of the existing recommendation algorithms based on dynamic evolutionary models leads to unstable recommendation accuracy. In addition, the collaborative filtering method of GCN does not take into account the dynamic evolution law of graph networks. Based on this, this research adopts GCN to train the initial embedding of the dynamic evolution model to perform collaborative filtering recommendation. First of all, a heterogeneous graph network is constructed by applying explicit feedback information (rating scores) of users. Secondly, the embedding of users and items are propagated through the dynamic evolution model. Then, the final embedding is obtained by weighting the embedding of each layer, and the scores are predicted. Finally, according to the Adam optimizer, the initial embedding of the dynamic evolution model is trained in the form of mini-batch to minimize the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to several compared excellent algorithms in recommendation performance.","doi":"10.1109/NaNA53684.2021.00077","startPage":"408","endPage":"413","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9634858/9634859/09634902.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaNA53684.2021.00077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dyn-GCN: Graph Embedding via Dynamic Evolution and Graph Convolutional Network for Personal Recommendation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Technological innovation","Heuristic algorithms","Collaborative filtering","Prediction algorithms","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recommendation system","Graph convolutional network","Dynamic evolution model","Embedding propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9634902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Dyn-GCN: Graph Embedding via Dynamic Evolution and Graph Convolutional Network for Personal Recommendation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9634902/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dyn-GCN: Graph Embedding via Dynamic Evolution and Graph Convolutional Network for Personal Recommendation","confLoc":"Lijiang City, China","sourcePdf":"415800a408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050109S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2021-Nov. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9634858","isNumber":"9634859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9634858","xplore-issue":"9634859","articleId":"9634902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9634933,"authors":[{"name":"Yangyang Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088705273"},{"name":"Pinchang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Pinchang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085863138"},{"name":"Xufei Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University"],"firstName":"Xufei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086689600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4158-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4159-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9634933","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"abstract":"This paper proposes an intelligent physical layer authentication scheme to learn the time-varying features of physical layer for mmWave MIMO communications.

The integration of radar and communication systems has recently attracted a lot of research and commercial interest. The emergence of spectrum-hungry applications have necessitated the exploitation of the permanently allocated, but potentially under-utilized spectral resources, and sharing the frequency bands between radar and communication systems has attracted substantial attention. Below 10 GHz, a large portion of spectral resources are primarily allocated to radar systems, which have seen increasing cohabitation with wireless communication systems. At the higher frequencies such as the millimeter-wave bands, the communication and radar platforms are also expected to coexist harmoniously. Nevertheless, with the allocation of the available frequency bands to the above wireless technologies, the interference in the radar bands is on the rise, and has raised concerns both from governmental and military organizations for the safeguarding of critical radar operations. With achieving spectral coexistence as one of its goals, research effort is well underway to address the issue of the spectral coexistence of communication and radar. Recognising the opportunities arising beyond coexistence, there has been a recent surge in research in designing joint communication and radar (JCR) systems, that go beyond managing interference between the two transmissions, to designing multi-functional transmissions that simultaneously serve the sensing and the communications functionalities.

Model","abstract":"The power flow model is usually used to estimate power from the central calculation for the whole power system. In recent years, data-driven approach is an emerging technique to determine power flow without knowing circuit parameters. However, with the development of renewable energy, more complex power grids are placing an increasing burden on central computing. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to estimate power from a single bus only which provides a quick reference to the power of a single bus. This method is based on modified linear power flow model, the core is to solve the challenge of power estimation using only one single bus data rather than whole power system data by analyzing the electrical relationship. The proposed modified linear power flow model includes both the nonlinear physical power flow model and the linear regression model. Simulation results on the IEEE Standard bus 30 show that this method has higher accuracy than other linear power flow models in single bus power calculation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635174/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","publicationDate":"17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single Bus Data-driven Power Estimation Based on Modified Linear Power Flow Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Bus Data-driven Power Estimation Based on Modified Linear Power Flow Model","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050212S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635007","isNumber":"9635094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635007","xplore-issue":"9635094","articleId":"9635174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9635256,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Baucum","affiliation":["Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Baucum"},{"name":"Anahita Khojandi","affiliation":["Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Anahita","lastName":"Khojandi"},{"name":"Theodore Papamarkou","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K.","Computational Sciences & Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, U.S.A."],"firstName":"Theodore","lastName":"Papamarkou"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-7819"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2159-5410"}],"articleNumber":"9635256","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Parameter estimation","Conferences","Biological system modeling","Hidden Markov models","Alzheimer's disease","Forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hidden Markov models","neural networks","disease progression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635256","doi":"10.1109/BIBE52308.2021.9635256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE52308.2021.9635256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635098","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 21st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 21st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635006/9635098/09635256.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov models as recurrent neural networks: An application to Alzheimer's disease","abstract":"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly used for disease progression modeling when the true patient health state is not fully known. Since HMMs typically have multiple local optima, incorporating additional patient covariates can improve parameter estimation and predictive performance. To allow for this, we develop hidden Markov recurrent neural networks (HMRNNs), a special case of recurrent neural networks that combine neural networks' flexibility with HMMs' interpretability. The HMRNN can be reduced to a standard HMM, with an identical likelihood function and parameter interpretations, but it can also combine an HMM with other predictive neural networks that take patient information as input. The HMRNN estimates all parameters simultaneously via gradient descent. Using a dataset of Alzheimer's disease patients, we demonstrate how the HMRNN can combine an HMM with other predictive neural networks to improve disease forecasting and to offer a novel clinical interpretation compared with a standard HMM trained via expectation-maximization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635256/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","publicationDate":"25 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov models as recurrent neural networks: An application to Alzheimer's disease","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007333","fundingName":"Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"U01 AG024904"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"DOD ADNI (Department of Defense)","grantNumber":"W81XWH-12-2-0012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016818","fundingName":"UT-Battelle, LLC","grantNumber":"DE-AC05-00OR22725"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006151","fundingName":"US Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DEAC05- 00OR22725"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov models as recurrent neural networks: An application to Alzheimer's disease","confLoc":"Kragujevac, Serbia","sourcePdf":"paper_064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109045S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635006","isNumber":"9635098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635006","xplore-issue":"9635098","articleId":"9635256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9635285,"authors":[{"name":"Songyu Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Songyu","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Zheng","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxia","lastName":"Zheng"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4961-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4960-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4962-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0525"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0517"}],"articleNumber":"9635285","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635285","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Renewable energy sources","Oils","Neural networks","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Stability analysis","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["oil temperature prediction of gearbox","long and short memory network","generalized regression neural network","Portfolio model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635285","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635007/9635094/09635285.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","startPage":"532","endPage":"537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Gearbox Oil Temperature of Wind Turbine Based on GRNN-LSTM Combined Model","abstract":"The gearbox oil temperature of offshore wind turbines(WTS) is one of the important indexes of gearbox state monitoring and fault warning.

Through comparison, it is found that the combined model can effectively combine the good mid- and long-term prediction ability of the LSTM algorithm with the good short-term prediction ability of the GRNN algorithm, which greatly improves the accuracy and stability of oil temperature prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635285/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9635285/","publicationDate":"17 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Gearbox Oil Temperature of Wind Turbine Based on GRNN-LSTM Combined Model","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Gearbox Oil Temperature of Wind Turbine Based on GRNN-LSTM Combined Model","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050315S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635007","isNumber":"9635094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635007","xplore-issue":"9635094","articleId":"9635285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9635314,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Tan","affiliation":["Anshun Power Supply Company, China Southern Power Grid Guizhou Power Grid Co.

Wind power forecasting is of great significance in spot trading, but the instability of wind power series brings difficulties to forecasting. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, prediction algorithm based on deep learning has been widely used in wind power prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network performs well in a variety of prediction scenarios, but there is still room for improvement. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of LSTM in wind power prediction, this paper adopts a new gating mechanism in LSTM network, which can improve the context information modeling ability of LSTM network. The experimental results based on real data show that the proposed improved LSTM prediction model can improve the prediction accuracy of LSTM prediction model in ultra-short term wind power prediction scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Renewable energy sources","Recurrent neural networks","Load forecasting","Wind power generation","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind power forecasting","ultra-short term forecasting","long short-term memory neural network","bi-directional recurrent neural network","deep learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635314","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635007/9635094/09635314.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-short-term Wind Power Forecasting Based on Improved LSTM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-short-term Wind Power Forecasting Based on Improved LSTM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635314/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"17 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635314/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-short-term Wind Power Forecasting Based on Improved LSTM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052633S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635007","isNumber":"9635094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635007","xplore-issue":"9635094","articleId":"9635314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9635320,"authors":[{"name":"Sandi Baressi \u0160egota","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Sandi Baressi","lastName":"\u0160egota"},{"name":"Nikola An\u0111eli\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"An\u0111eli\u0107"},{"name":"Ivan Lorencin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Lorencin"},{"name":"Jelena Musulin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Musulin"},{"name":"Daniel \u0160tifani\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"\u0160tifani\u0107"},{"name":"Zlatan Car","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Zlatan","lastName":"Car"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4261-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4262-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-7819"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2159-5410"}],"articleNumber":"9635320","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Shape","Conferences","Computer architecture","Transforms","Classification algorithms","Timing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial intelligence","convolutional neural networks","data processing and transformation","machine learning","SMILES"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635320","abstract":"Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a type of chemical notation.

To reduce the spatial correlation, computational complexity, and memory requirement, we use t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on MRI volume to reduce its dimensions. Also, we use parallel CNN instead of sequential to analyze MRI volumes and a combination of RELU, sigmoid, and SIREN activation functions to learn better features for the classification of MCI. To check the efficacy of the proposed t-SNE Multiple-Activation Parallel Convolution Network, experiments are performed on publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and performance is compared with existing methods.

Owing to the non-linearity in most time-series datasets developing a single linear or nonlinear model is insufficient for predicting and forecasting load power consumption. This study constructs a hybrid forecasting model that combines conventional neural network (CNN) with long short-term memory network (LSTM) for short-term forecasting of time series to exploit the upper performance of a hybrid model on load forecasting over an individual LSTM model. The suggested architecture addresses both linear and nonlinear patterns in the actual dataset, allowing it to extract more precise features to better forecast power consumption. The suggested models rely on merging two deep learning architectures in a hybrid model to forecast more precisely the load consumption of a household-based in Morocco. Hence, the originality of this work resides in predicting load consumption over different time intervals by utilizing the record measurements from various former weeks. Thus, using records from the past two weeks resulted in highly accurate predictions for the one 1 day ahead and 5 days ahead of time windows with MAE of 5.48 and 6.51 respectively. However, the last three weeks' data was more valuable for the LSTM model resulting in more efficient predictions when compared to CNN-LSTM with an MAE of 6.69 and 8.45 respectively for the three days ahead of the time window and 7.59 and 8.84 for the five days ahead. The empirical results show that the proposed model adequately learns the load consumption patterns of the household and accurately predicts the short-term power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635488","startPage":"886","endPage":"891","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635094","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635007/9635094/09635488.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting: Based on Hybrid CNN-LSTM Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635488/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting: Based on Hybrid CNN-LSTM Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9635488/","publicationDate":"17 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting: Based on Hybrid CNN-LSTM Neural Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055124S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635007","isNumber":"9635094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635007","xplore-issue":"9635094","articleId":"9635488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9635547,"authors":[{"name":"Daogang Peng","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Daogang","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Shihao Yun","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shihao","lastName":"Yun"},{"name":"Debin Yin","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Process Automation & Instrumentation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Yin"},{"name":"Bin Shen","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Process Automation & Instrumentation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Shen"},{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Process Automation & Instrumentation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4961-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4960-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4962-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-0525"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-0517"}],"articleNumber":"9635547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635547","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Renewable energy sources","Neural networks","Control systems","Feature extraction","Wavelet packets","Turbines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gas turbine control system","sensor fault diagnosis","BP neural network","moth-flame optimization"]}],"abstract":"The sensor is responsible for monitoring the running state of gas turbine in gas turbine control system, so it is of great significance to carry out fault diagnosis of the sensor in gas turbine control system.

For reducing the volatility of offshore wind power data to extract the salient features of the power signal, a variational modal decomposition algorithm optimized by the seagull algorithm is used to decompose the power series into several eigenmodal components and a residual component that may contain uncertainties affecting the power prediction; the decomposed several eigenmodal components are built into a prediction model based on the long and short-term memory network, and the residual component is built into a prediction model based on the extreme learning machine. The final offshore wind power is obtained by superimposing and integrating the prediction results of each component. It is shown that the combined model can predict both the slow fluctuation of offshore wind power and the drastic change of power in the climbing section compared with the single model and BP neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635584","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1039","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635007/9635094/09635584.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Power and Renewable Energy (ICPRE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRE52634.2021.9635584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offshore Wind Power Prediction Based on Variational Mode Decomposition and Long Short Term Memory Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Renewable energy sources","Uncertainty","Fluctuations","Wind power generation","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["offshore wind power prediction","long short term memory networks","extreme learning machine","variational modal decomposition","seagull optimization algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Offshore Wind Power Prediction Based on Variational Mode Decomposition and Long Short Term Memory Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9635584/","publicationDate":"17 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offshore Wind Power Prediction Based on Variational Mode Decomposition and Long Short Term Memory Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"Paper185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042599S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635007","isNumber":"9635094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635007","xplore-issue":"9635094","articleId":"9635584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9635652,"authors":[{"name":"Zheyi Chen","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9635652/chen-3132422-small.gif","p":["Zheyi Chen received the BSc degree in computer science from Shanxi University, China, in 2014 and the MSc degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, China, in 2017.

However, due to the dynamic system states and various user demands, efficient resource allocation in cloud faces huge challenges. Most of the existing solutions for cloud resource allocation cannot effectively handle the dynamic cloud environments because they depend on the prior knowledge of a cloud system, which may lead to excessive energy consumption and degraded Quality-of-Service (QoS). To address this problem, we propose an adaptive and efficient cloud resource allocation scheme based on Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). First, the actor parameterizes the policy (allocating resources) and chooses actions (scheduling jobs) based on the scores assessed by the critic (evaluating actions). Next, the resource allocation policy is updated by using gradient ascent while the variance of policy gradient is reduced with an advantage function, which improves the training efficiency of the proposed method. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using real-world data from Google cloud datacenters. The results show that our method can obtain the superior QoS in terms of latency and job dismissing rate with enhanced energy-efficiency, compared to two advanced DRL-based and five classic cloud resource allocation methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3132422","startPage":"1911","endPage":"1923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3132422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09635652.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Datacenters Using Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635652/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Datacenters Using Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning","volume":"33","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/9635652/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU Horizon 2020 INITIATE","grantNumber":"101008297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive and Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Datacenters Using Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"tpds-hu-3132422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10337S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9635652","onlineDate":"03 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9635684,"authors":[{"name":"Mengru Sun","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, also with the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9675017/9635684/sun-3132485-small.gif","p":["Mengru Sun received the B.S. degree in electronic information engineering (underwater acoustics) from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2017.

This method is not succinct, and sometimes may be cumbersome and difficult to handle. Recently, a complex parameter Rao test was introduced by Kay and Zhu without the need of cascading the real and imaginary parts of the complex parameters when there is no nuisance parameter. Inspired by this work, we move a further step toward the complex parameter statistics of the Rao, Wald, gradient, and Durbin tests both with and without nuisance parameters, and derive the relationships between their real and complex parameter statistics. Moreover, for a special Fisher information matrix which often holds in practice, we derive a series of simple forms of the complex parameter statistics for the above four criteria, and discuss their application conditions in linear multivariate complex circular Gaussian distribution. Finally, several application examples are given to confirm the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635684/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complex Parameter Rao, Wald, Gradient, and Durbin Tests for Multichannel Signal Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071482, 61971412, 61871469 and 61771442"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004739","fundingName":"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"CX2100060053"},{"fundingName":"USTC Tang Scholar"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Frontier Sciences, CAS","grantNumber":"QYZDY-SSW-JSC035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Parameter Rao, Wald, Gradient, and Durbin Tests for Multichannel Signal Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-sun-3132485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108137S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9635684","onlineDate":"03 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9635685,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Wen Qin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, P.R.

Completely independent spanning trees (CISTs for short) are powerful tools for reliable broadcasting/unicasting and secure message distribution. Particularly, it has been shown that two CISTs have an application on configuring a protection routing in IP networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks and relatively large (static) network topologies with scalability in [IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw., 27 (2019) 1112-1123]. Many results focus on CISTs in specific networks in the literature, however, few results are given on an infinite class of networks having common properties. In this article, we prove the existence of dual-CISTs in an infinite number of networks satisfying some Hamilton sufficient conditions. A unique algorithm to construct a CIST-partition is proposed, which can be applied to not only many kinds of networks, but our algorithm can also be implemented very easily in parallel or distributed systems satisfying the conditions. In addition, we make a comparative analysis between the proposed conditions and several known results on an infinite number of networks, the advantage of our result is significant. In particular, the bound in our conditions is sharp. The results will provide a powerful framework for the design of fault-tolerant network topologies and routing protocols for future networks.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3132412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1902","endPage":"1910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3132412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09635685.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Fault tolerance","Hypercubes","Tools","Routing","Network topology","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Completely independent spanning trees","a protection routing","CIST-partition","Hamilton bipartition sufficient condition","constructive algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Dual-CISTs on an Infinite Class of Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635685/","volume":"33","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/9635685/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11971054 and 11731002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Dual-CISTs on an Infinite Class of Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-hao-3132412-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267748S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9642402","articleId":"9635685","onlineDate":"03 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":9635805,"authors":[{"name":"Richard P.

For information transfer, however, subcarrier assignment is only sum-rate optimal when the network is interference limited; otherwise, it is optimal to reuse subcarriers. Beamforming-based space-division multiple access (SDMA) is a multiple access technique that enables subcarrier reuse by managing interference. Although beamforming is considered a key SWIPT component, OFDM-based SWIPT has yet to utilize beamforming for SDMA. As such, this paper seeks to develop a low-complexity resource allocation strategy to jointly allocate power and design beamforming vectors for an OFDM-based multiuser (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) SWIPT system capable of utilizing SDMA. To this end, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated in which a weighted sum of user data rates is maximized subject to meeting receive and transmit power constraints. The time-sharing property of multicarrier systems is observed to justify utilizing Lagrangian decomposition despite the non-convexity. Whereas previous SWIPT research used Lagrangian decomposition to simplify subcarrier assignment, this paper instead uses it to enable SDMA through beamforming. Beamforming is achieved via a medium access channel (MAC)-BC duality, which enables a closed-form solution for the beamforming vectors given the dual MAC power allocation. The dual MAC power allocation is approximated using a successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. The result is a resource allocation algorithm that provides close-to-optimal performance with low computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635805/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Multiuser MISO Broadcast Channel SWIPT Employing OFDM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004040","fundingName":"ESAT Laboratory, KU Leuven, in the frame of: Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique\u2014Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek\u2014Vlaanderen EOS Project W\u2019(MUSE-WINET) MUlti-SErvice WIreless NETwork\u2019","grantNumber":"30452698"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Multiuser MISO Broadcast Channel SWIPT Employing OFDM","sourcePdf":"access-ketcham-3132769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159585S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9635805","onlineDate":"03 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9635821,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenkun Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9635821/cai-3132413-small.gif","p":["Zhenkun Cai is currently working toward the PhD degree with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The centroidal dynamics have recently received a large amount of attention in order to create physically realizable motions for robots with hands and feet while being computationally more tractable than full rigid body dynamics models. Our contribution lies in exploiting the structure of the dynamics in order to simplify the original non-convex problem into two convex subproblems. We iterate between these two subproblems for a set number of iterations or until a consensus is reached. We explore the properties of the proposed optimization method for the centroidal dynamics and verify in simulation that motions generated by our approach can be tracked by the quadruped Solo12. In addition, we compare our method to a recently proposed convexification using a sequence of convex relaxations as well as a more standard interior point method used in the off-the-shelf solver IPOPT to show that our approach finds similar, if not better, trajectories (in terms of cost), and is more than four times faster than both approaches. Finally, compared to previous approaches, we note its practicality due to the convex nature of each subproblem which allows our method to be used with any off-the-shelf quadratic programming solver.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635856","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635848/9635849/09635856.pdf","startPage":"1658","endPage":"1665","doi":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid Convex Optimization of Centroidal Dynamics using Block Coordinate Descent","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Convex Optimization of Centroidal Dynamics using Block Coordinate Descent","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9635856/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9635856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid Convex Optimization of Centroidal Dynamics using Block Coordinate Descent","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087707S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635848","isNumber":"9635849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635848","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9635849","articleId":"9635856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9635976,"authors":[{"name":"Harshit Khurana","affiliation":["Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Harshit","lastName":"Khurana","id":"37089197539"},{"name":"Michael Bombile","affiliation":["Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bombile","id":"37086286260"},{"name":"Aude Billard","affiliation":["Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Aude","lastName":"Billard","id":"37273980800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1714-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1715-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"9635976","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9635976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Friction","Dynamics","End effectors","Dynamical systems","Collision avoidance","Intelligent robots"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a manipulation scheme based on learning the motion of objects after being hit by a robotic end-effector.

We present a reinforcement learning solution that learns an optimal arbitration strategy that allocates more control authority to the human when the robot comes across a decision point in the task. A decision point is where the robot encounters multiple options (sub-policies), such as having multiple paths to get around an obstacle or deciding between two candidate goals. By expressing each directional sub-policy as a von Mises distribution, we identify the decision points by observing the modality of the mixture distribution. Our reward function reasons on this modality and prioritizes to match its learned policy to either the user or the robot accordingly. We report teleoperation experiments on reach-and-grasping objects using a robot manipulator arm with different simulated human controllers. Results indicate that our shared control agent outperforms direct control and improves the teleoperation performance among different users. Using our reward term enables flexible blending between human and robot commands while maintaining safe and accurate teleoperation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636049","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635848/9635849/09636049.pdf","startPage":"5305","endPage":"5311","doi":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Arbitrate Human and Robot Control using Disagreement between Sub-Policies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Arbitrate Human and Robot Control using Disagreement between Sub-Policies","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9636049/","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9636049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Arbitrate Human and Robot Control using Disagreement between Sub-Policies","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"1064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081223S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635848","isNumber":"9635849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635848","xplore-issue":"9635849","articleId":"9636049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9636242,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Pereira","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37087119814"},{"name":"Lu\u00eds Garrote","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Lu\u00eds","lastName":"Garrote","id":"38243509200"},{"name":"Tiago Barros","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Barros","id":"37087120831"},{"name":"Ana Lopes","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra, Portugal","Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Lopes","id":"37410502800"},{"name":"Urbano J.

However, problems such as inter-class similarity and intra-class variation led to the need of obtaining more descriptive features. To accomplish this, a new semantic inter-object relationship approach is proposed, which is based on the distance relationships between recognized objects. This new source of information represents how close or apart objects belonging to two object classes are, which, together with the number of object occurrences, allows to develop a more descriptive semantic feature representation of the scene. To exploit such semantic features, a two-branch CNN architecture based on 1D and 2D convolutional layers, is proposed. Also, an enhancement version, GSF\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nAppV2, of the Global and Semantic Feature Fusion described in [1] is proposed by integrating the new semantic inter-object relationship approach, as well as the aforementioned two-branch CNN architecture.

DDC offers a state-of-the-art, high performance control based on data and expert knowledge.

On the other hand, purely data based control overcomes this drawback by adapting a Neural Network (NN) inverse control directly on measured input/output data. Yet, coverage of the entire phase space and extrapolation to unknown situations is challenging for solely data-driven approaches. On a real demonstrator, we analyze expert white box methods, solely data-driven black box approaches and a hybrid grey box approach which combines a data-driven and simplified expert model. We examine trajectory tracking performance, engineering effort and safe exploration as goal criteria.

Planning happens by generating open-loop trajectories in a learned latent space that captures the dynamics of the environment. Our planner considers visual (RGB images) and non-visual observations (e.g., attitude estimations). This confers the agent upon awareness not only of the scenario, but also of its own state. In addition, we incorporate a termination likelihood predictor model as an auxiliary loss function of the control policy, which enables the agent to anticipate terminal states of success and failure. In this manner, the sample efficiency of the approach for episodic tasks is increased. Our model is evaluated on the NimbRo-OP2X humanoid robot that navigates in scenes avoiding collisions efficiently in simulation and with the real hardware.","doi":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636593","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1561","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635848/9635849/09636593.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapless Humanoid Navigation Using Learned Latent Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Mapless Humanoid Navigation Using Learned Latent Dynamics","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9636593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9636593/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapless Humanoid Navigation Using Learned Latent Dynamics","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0924.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143712S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635848","isNumber":"9635849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635848","xplore-issue":"9635849","articleId":"9636593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9636747,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuto Nakashima","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Motoka Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuto","lastName":"Nakashima","id":"37085376805"},{"name":"Ryo Kurazume","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Motoka Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Kurazume","id":"37271916800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1714-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1715-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2153-0858"}],"articleNumber":"9636747","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"abstract":"3D laser scanning by LiDAR sensors plays an important role for mobile robots to understand their surroundings. Nevertheless, not all systems have high resolution and accuracy due to hardware limitations, weather conditions, and so on. Generative modeling of LiDAR data as scene priors is one of the promising solutions to compensate for unreliable or incomplete observations. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model for learning LiDAR data based on generative adversarial networks. As in the related studies, we process LiDAR data as a compact yet lossless representation, a cylindrical depth map. However, despite the smoothness of real-world objects, many points on the depth map are dropped out through the laser measurement, which causes learning difficulty on generative models. To circumvent this issue, we introduce measurement uncertainty into the generation process, which allows the model to learn a disentangled representation of the underlying shape and the dropout noises from a collection of real LiDAR data. To simulate the lossy measurement, we adopt a differentiable sampling framework to drop points based on the learned uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthesis and reconstruction tasks using two datasets. We further showcase potential applications by restoring LiDAR data with various types of corruption.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser radar","Uncertainty","Measurement uncertainty","Generative adversarial networks","Laser modes","Data models","Loss measurement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636747","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9635848/9635849/09636747.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9635849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Drop Points for LiDAR Scan Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9636747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Drop Points for LiDAR Scan Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9636747/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"27 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9636747/","conferenceDate":"27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Drop Points for LiDAR Scan Synthesis","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"2486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119266S","chronDate":"Sept. 27 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9635848","isNumber":"9635849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9635848","xplore-issue":"9635849","articleId":"9636747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9636786,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan D.

Most vehicle counting solutions are based on frame-by frame object detection and tracking to calculate the number of cars that cross a counting line.

In this work, we use time-spatial images to focus only on the information happening along the counting lines, instead of whole images, to reduce redundancy. Due to the nature of time-spatial images, vehicle counting can be achieved by object detection in such images without frame-by-frame tracking. We propose Foreground Favorable Model to conquer occlusion, congestion, and lighting change problems and Cross-Image Object Linking to conquer the distortion problem of nearly static vehicles. We also present an automatic time-spatial image dataset generation flow and the first time-spatial image dataset, called DRIVE-TSI, for vehicle counting tasks. Our vehicle counting accuracy beats state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and is proved to be much more efficient because it only focuses on a small number of pixels.

Existing resilience enhancement approaches do not dispatch shunts to maintain voltage magnitudes within the standard limits during extreme weather events, and are computationally expensive. In this work, a data-driven approach is proposed to both exploit the capability of shunts in enhancing power system operational resilience against windstorms and to overcome the computational burden of analytical optimization methods. In the proposed approach, a multi-agent framework is developed using the fundamental continuous soft actor critic algorithm to dispatch shunts during windstorms. The developed multi-agent framework is trained using hypothetical multiple line outages, which are generated based on line fragility curves against windstorms. The trained network dispatches shunt compensators whenever there are voltage violations during windstorms (i.e., dependent multiple line outages in the path of a windstorm), thereby enhancing the operational resilience of power systems against windstorms. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-Bus system. The results show that voltage magnitudes can be maintained within the standard limits for most of simulated scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Optimization methods","Voltage","Load shedding","Power system stability","Stability analysis","System buses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep reinforcement learning","power system resilience","shunt reactive power","soft-actor-critic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESGM46819.2021.9637876","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9637707/9637818/09637876.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9637818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM46819.2021.9637876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-driven Shunt Dispatch Approach to Enhance Power System Resilience against Windstorms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9637876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data-driven Shunt Dispatch Approach to Enhance Power System Resilience against Windstorms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9637876/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9637876/","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"NSF 1847578"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-driven Shunt Dispatch Approach to Enhance Power System Resilience against Windstorms","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2021-000884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068865S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9637707","isNumber":"9637818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9637707","xplore-issue":"9637818","articleId":"9637876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9638004,"authors":[{"name":"Ilias Zenelis","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ilias","lastName":"Zenelis","id":"37086400331"},{"name":"Georgia Pierrou","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Pierrou","id":"37086881927"},{"name":"Xiaozhe Wang","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaozhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085422903"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0507-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4630-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9933"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"9638004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Power system dynamics","Power smoothing","Power system stability","Wind power generation","Stability analysis","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven methods","energy storage systems","small-signal stability monitoring","wind power"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9638004","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a data-driven energy storage system (ESS)-based method to enhance the online small-signal stability monitoring of power networks with high penetration of intermittent wind power. To accurately estimate inter-area modes that are closely related to the system's inherent stability characteristics, a novel algorithm that leverages on recent advances in wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs) and ESS technologies is developed. It is shown that the proposed approach can smooth the wind power fluctuations in near real-time using a small additional ESS capacity and thus significantly enhance the monitoring of small-signal stability. Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations on the IEEE 68-bus system are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in smoothing wind power and estimating the inter-area mode statistical properties.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM46819.2021.9638004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM46819.2021.9638004","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9637707/9637818/09638004.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9637818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Energy Storage System-Based Algorithm for Monitoring the Small-Signal Stability of Power Grids with Volatile Wind Power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Energy Storage System-Based Algorithm for Monitoring the Small-Signal Stability of Power Grids with Volatile Wind Power","conferenceDate":"26-29 July 2021","publicationDate":"26 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9638004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9638004/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Energy Storage System-Based Algorithm for Monitoring the Small-Signal Stability of Power Grids with Volatile Wind Power","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2021-000473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107773S","chronDate":"26-29 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9637707","isNumber":"9637818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9637707","xplore-issue":"9637818","articleId":"9638004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9638171,"authors":[{"name":"Ketian Ye","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Ketian","lastName":"Ye","id":"37088892472"},{"name":"Junbo Zhao","affiliation":["Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Junbo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085368574"},{"name":"Can Huang","affiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085403758"},{"name":"Nan Duan","affiliation":["Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Duan","id":"37287162700"},{"name":"Fei Ding","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085857234"},{"name":"Rui Yang","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085887158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0507-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4630-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9933"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"9638171","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"abstract":"Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of distribution system with respect to stochastic PV variations plays an important role in designing optimal voltage control schemes.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of image scaling on the image processing algorithms, with focus on object detection. Different methods for image scaling are presented and their impact on the algorithms are measured. We propose an adaptive scaling mechanism, that implies the selection and dynamic adaptive configuration of one of the available hardware engines (interpolators), in order to optimize the power consumption and the bandwidth used for data transmission. The artificial intelligence processing outputs are used as a source for these configuration changes. Besides the optimal decision on enabling the appropriate re-sampling interpolator, the parameters computed (in order to configure this selected hardware block) are the quality of the scaling and the image resolution. The hardware implementation for this mechanism is presented and the measured results are discussed.

The campus integrated microgrid is composed of photovoltaic parking shades, an energy storage system, electric vehicles and bikes, loads, an advanced metering infrastructure, and a smart control unit. The latter is based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) whose objective is to reduce/shave the peak load of the campus while satisfying the Energy Storage System ESS, electrical Vehicles (EVs) and Electrical Bikes (EBs) state of charge. The proposed strategy aims to take the advantage of combining storage and photovoltaic (PV) systems to Vehicle to Campus (V2C) and Bike to Campus (B2C) concepts to support the microgrid to pay the minimum billing power while ensuring a good service quality to the EVs and EBs users. For that, the integration of the renewable energy sources and the different storage systems into the microgrid is modeled, and the MPC-based optimization framework is formulated. Besides, the results related to the application of the MPC to real case studies are presented, integrating the effects of static and dynamic weighting factors on the microgrid operation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09638482.pdf","startPage":"162765","endPage":"162778","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3132895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control Based Demand Response Scheme for Peak Demand Reduction in a Smart Campus Integrated Microgrid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control Based Demand Response Scheme for Peak Demand Reduction in a Smart Campus Integrated Microgrid","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9638482/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9638482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Library (QNL)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Model Predictive Control Based Demand Response Scheme for Peak Demand Reduction in a Smart Campus Integrated Microgrid","sourcePdf":"access-ouammi-3132895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090114S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9638482","onlineDate":"06 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":9638492,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Feng Lu","affiliation":["National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9638492/lu-3132937-small.gif","p":["Hsiao-Feng (Francis) Lu (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 1999 and 2003, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada, from 2003 to 2004.

In contrast to existing works which have mostly focused on maximizing the sum rate, we first investigate the problem of finding the maximal sum rate achieved by DPC when the qualitative notions of fairness such as max-min fairness and proportional fairness are employed. This corresponds to a nonconvex problem and cannot be solved by usual weighted sum rate techniques. Several efficient methods for finding the optimal solutions are presented in this paper when the order of users is adjustable during DPC encoding. Simulation results show surprisingly and impact greatly on the design of practical systems that it is often possible to achieve the sum rate capacity with absolute fairness, i.e., an equal rate for each user, when multiple encoding orders of users are used during transmission. When sum rate capacity and absolute fairness cannot be achieved at the same time, the optimal tradeoff between sum rate and fairness is also provided for a general class of quantitative fairness measures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

NN is suitable for the process having a wide range of operating conditions. In this work, the neural network-based internal model control (NN-IMC) scheme has been considered as a secondary controller for the load frequency control (LFC) problem in the restructured electricity market in order to meet Poolco and bilateral transactions. The proposed control scheme has been implemented on a 75-bus, 15-generator power system. The test system is divided into four areas. It is seen that area frequency errors have been eliminated at a steady state in all cases, and Gencos/Discos shared the increase in demand as per their involvement in the frequency regulation market. The results show that the NN-IMC control scheme has good performance and improves system responses effectively. Further, the performance of the NN-IMC control scheme has also been compared with the fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FO-PID) control scheme It is observed that the performance of the FO-PID controller is superior to the NN-IMC scheme in terms of settling time and similar to the NN-IMC control scheme in terms of maximum overshoots/undershoots. The compliance of the NN-IMC scheme has also been checked with NERC standards. It is seen that the NN-IMC scheme also satisfied the CPS1 and CPS2 control standards.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133360","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09638627.pdf","startPage":"162231","endPage":"162242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Neural Network-Based Load Frequency Control Scheme: A Case Study of Restructured Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9638627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2021","displayDocTitle":"Novel Neural Network-Based Load Frequency Control Scheme: A Case Study of Restructured Power System","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9638627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002383","fundingName":"Researchers Supporting Project at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"RSP-2021/278"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Novel Neural Network-Based Load Frequency Control Scheme: A Case Study of Restructured Power System","sourcePdf":"access-malik-3133360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071516S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9638627","onlineDate":"06 December 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9638876,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoshun Li","affiliation":["Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robot, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei"],"firstName":"Yaoshun","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Lizhi Liu","affiliation":["Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robot, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei"],"firstName":"Lizhi","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2730-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2729-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2731-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9638876","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9638876","abstract":"Based on the YOLOv3 model, this paper proposes a YOLO-ResNet model for rebar detection. YOLO-ResNet model is based on ResNet-18 (Residual Network 18), retains the first four downsamplings, and adds CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention model to the input and output parts to obtain a $52\\times 52$-sized feature map for rebar detection by feature fusion process. Firstly, this paper clusters the width and height of the rebar in the training set to obtain new anchor prior boxes, then replaces the Darknet-53 network of YOLOv3 with an improved backbone network, and finally introduces the FocalLoss to penalize the easily divided negative samples so as to make the model converge faster. Compared with YOLOv3, the number of convolutional layers of YOLO-ResNet is reduced by 45 layers, the total training parameters are reduced by 94.35%, the training time of the model is reduced by an average of 40% under different training times, the GPU memory usage during training is reduced by 56%, and the model weight size has been reduced by 94%. We use 4 evaluation indicators of TrainTime, BestLoss, mAP and Accuarcy for the model. The experimental results show that the YOLO-ResNet model has better performance, less training time, lower GPU memory usage, and smaller model weight files than the YOLOv3 model without reducing the detection accuracy in the rebar detection.","doi":"10.1109/RCAE53607.2021.9638876","startPage":"128","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Robotics, Control and Automation Engineering (RCAE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9638696/9638779/09638876.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Robotics, Control and Automation Engineering (RCAE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RCAE53607.2021.9638876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9638779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"YOLO-ResNet: A New Model for Rebar Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Automation","Memory management","Graphics processing units","Production","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rebar detection","YOLOv3","CBAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9638876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"YOLO-ResNet: A New Model for Rebar Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9638876/","publicationDate":"4 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","conferenceDate":"4-6 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012554","fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Department of Education"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008869","fundingName":"Wuhan Institute of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"YOLO-ResNet: A New Model for Rebar Detection","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"Wuhan-ART-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069818S","chronDate":"4-6 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9638696","isNumber":"9638779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9638696","xplore-issue":"9638779","articleId":"9638876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9638921,"authors":[{"name":"Yichuan Fu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Yichuan","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086263831"},{"name":"Zhiwei Gao","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37077548400"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Northumbria at Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom","China General Certification Center (CGC), Beijing, P.R.C."],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086660467"},{"name":"Aihua Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering, School of Physical Science and Technology, Bohai University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, P.R.C."],"firstName":"Aihua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37983218600"},{"name":"Xiuxia Yin","affiliation":["Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, P.R.C."],"firstName":"Xiuxia","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085537461"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2730-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2729-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2731-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9638921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","Support vector machine classification","Stators","Control systems","Classification algorithms","Topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven","fault classification","expectation maximisation principal component analysis","t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding","support vector machine","three-phase induction machines","stator inter-turn faults"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9638921","doi":"10.1109/RCAE53607.2021.9638921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RCAE53607.2021.9638921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9638779","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Robotics, Control and Automation Engineering (RCAE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Robotics, Control and Automation Engineering (RCAE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9638696/9638779/09638921.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Fault Classification for Three-Phase Induction Machines under Stator Inter-Turn Faults","abstract":"Data-driven fault classification for induction machines has received much attention in electric drives.

A standardized reporting process called Breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) is used to categorize breast cancer. The BI-RADS scale uses several features of lesions based on the ultrasound images, which makes the quality of the diagnosis highly dependent on the experience of the radiologist. Radiologists use Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to help in the detection of lesions. The accuracy of a CAD system depends greatly on the segmentation stage of the system. To increase the reliability of the diagnosis, we propose a solution based on a densely connected deep convolutional neural network and attention gates, called Attention U-DenseNet. Attention U-DenseNet is an architecture to do semantic segmentation of the lesions from Breast Ultrasound (BUS) images based on the U-Net, DenseNet, and attention gates. Convolutional layers of the U-Net are made densely connected using dense blocks to help to learn complex patterns of the BUS image which is usually noisy and contaminated with speckles. This architecture (U-DenseNet) produced an F-score of 0.63 compared to the U-Net model with an F-score of 0.49. Furthermore, to localize the segmentation by learning salient features, attention gates are added to the U-DenseNet architecture (Attention U-DenseNet). Attention U-DenseNet performed even better compared to U-DenseNet, by improving the F-score to 0.75. Finally, a per-image regularised binary cross-entropy is employed to penalize false negatives more than false positives, since the region of interest is small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9639178/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9639178/","publicationDate":"4 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2021","conferenceDate":"4-5 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Breast Ultrasound Images using Densely Connected Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Attention Gates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Breast Ultrasound Images using Densely Connected Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Attention Gates","confLoc":"Gainesville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"8064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057813S","chronDate":"4-5 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639073","isNumber":"9639094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639073","xplore-issue":"9639094","articleId":"9639178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9639231,"authors":[{"name":"Aishwarya Mallampati","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Aishwarya","lastName":"Mallampati","id":"37089190383"},{"name":"Mohamed Almekkawy","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Almekkawy","id":"38469408100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4360-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9639231","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Inverse problems","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Elasticity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elastography","Ultrasound","Artificial Neural Networks","Deep Learning","Physics-Informed Neural Networks","Linear elasticity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9639231","abstract":"Ultrasound elastography is a non-invasive and low-cost imaging technique that is used to detect abnormalities in soft tissues. Elastography detects solid tumors from healthy tissues by observing changes in elasticity of tissues on application of force. Reconstruction of initial tissue modulus distribution based on measured displacement/strain fields is called an inverse elasticity problem which has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis. This paper tries to measure the elastic properties of tissues using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The input data consists of pre-compression and post-compression images of a phantom. Displacement and strain fields are computed from input data which are fed to our PINN model. The PINN model consists of five independent feed-forward neural networks. The model is trained using a loss function that incorporates physics laws based on linear elasticity along with the input data. Lame constants ($\\lambda$ and $\\mu$) are considered as network parameters that change during the training phase. The ground truth $\\lambda$ value is 920 kPa whereas the value predicted by the model is 925.319 kPa.

Different machine learning algorithms such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are widely used to conduct time-series forecasting. This paper proposes a method based on LSTM integrated with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which extracts features of power system peak loads, meteorological and calendar data. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the proposed method along with RNN and LSTM. Results show that the DWT-LSTM has a higher R2 and lower error metrics (Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)) compared to the conventional methods. Comparative studies for DWT-LSTM considering various mother wavelets (Haar, Daubechies, biorthogonal and reverse biorthogonal) are also conducted. Simulation results show that Daubechies wavelet outperforms other mother wavelets. Besides, the filter length and decomposition level of DWT are also essential to conduct the feature extraction.","doi":"10.1109/ICPEA52760.2021.9639283","startPage":"88","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Power and Energy Applications (ICPEA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPEA52760.2021.9639283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639081","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 4th International Conference on Power and Energy Applications (ICPEA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639076/9639081/09639283.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Studies on Use of Discrete Wavelet Transform-based Feature Extraction for Peak Load Forecasting Using LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9639283/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparative Studies on Use of Discrete Wavelet Transform-based Feature Extraction for Peak Load Forecasting Using LSTM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9639283/","publicationDate":"9 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005182","fundingName":"Institute of Nuclear Energy Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Studies on Use of Discrete Wavelet Transform-based Feature Extraction for Peak Load Forecasting Using LSTM","confLoc":"Busan, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"ChapterIII-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083223S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639076","isNumber":"9639081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639076","xplore-issue":"9639081","articleId":"9639283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9639328,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089198085"},{"name":"Pan Zhen","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Zhen","id":"37089194774"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088954781"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088596538"},{"name":"Daoxing Guo","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Daoxing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3279-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3280-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9639328","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Spaceborne radar","Neural networks","Radar imaging","Feature extraction","Real-time systems","Radar signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar emitter identification","bispectrum","multichannel convolutional neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9639328","abstract":"Aiming at the problem that a kind of bispectrum one-dimensional data is extracted as the individual identification feature of radar emitter resulting in the loss of a lot of useful information in a complex electromagnetic environment, we make full use of the characteristic of symmetry of bispectrum structures, fuse the extracted bispectrum structure, and input an improved multi-channel one-dimensional convolutional neural network in parallel in this paper.

The proposed system architecture employs a novel bias circuit together with a three-stage fully differential amplifier based transimpedance amplification stage. The bias circuit provides a DC biasing voltage for photodiode (PD) and isolates the large PD parasitic capacitance from the core amplifier, without reducing the output voltage range. The three-stage amplifier provides a high gain and its output stage exploits a class AB topology, increasing the driving capability. Moreover, the bandwidth of the system can be reconfigurable by changing the feedback components, which can improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and reduce the system power consumption. The amplifier and auxiliary circuit are implemented in a standard 55nm CMOS process. The simulation results show that the readout system consumes a total power of 46\u00b5A current from 1.2V supply.

The sensor consists of a 180\u00ba low-impedance open-ended sensing line cascaded to a 90\u00ba line with high characteristic impedance. Such high impedance line section is used to boost-up the sensitivity, and is not part of the so-called sensing region, exclusively formed by the 180\u00ba open-ended line. In order to characterize liquid samples, a fluidic channel is placed on top of the sensing line. Moreover, a dry film covers the sensing region, in order to avoid liquid absorption by the substrate.

There are many published works detailing with methods to estimate and monitor water-containing multiphase flows based on different sensor modalities, including electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). A recently developed method based on ECT sensors to estimate the water volume fraction in water-containing two-phase flows utilizes the Hanai\u2019s mixture formula. Fresh or tap water is conductive and has large electrical permittivity, thus making the ECT-based estimation problem highly nonlinear and challenging to solve. Most of these works assume that the mixture state of water in the two-phase flow is known as either continuous or disperse. However, in practice, the state of water might not be known a priori. In this work, we propose a deep learning based approach to classify water-containing flows into water-dispersed or water-continuous flows and to estimate the water volume fraction present in the flow.","doi":"10.1109/SENSORS47087.2021.9639686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSORS47087.2021.9639686","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Sensors","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639447/9639235/09639686.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Sensors","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Volume Fraction Estimation for Two-Phase Water-Containing Flows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 3 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Volume Fraction Estimation for Two-Phase Water-Containing Flows","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"31 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9639686/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9639686/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Volume Fraction Estimation for Two-Phase Water-Containing Flows","confLoc":"Sydney, Australia","sourcePdf":"1369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066267S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 3 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639447","isNumber":"9639235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639447","xplore-issue":"9639235","articleId":"9639686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9639689,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Min Chang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Min","lastName":"Chang"},{"name":"Chin-Han Chang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Han","lastName":"Chang"},{"name":"Yu-Bin Chen","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Bin","lastName":"Chen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2661-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2662-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9639689","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9639689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Production","Inspection","Filtering algorithms","Feature extraction","Cameras"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep learning","defect inspection","front opening unified pod (FOUP)","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAI52893.2021.9639689","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639445/9639239/09639689.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference Automatics and Informatics (ICAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference Automatics and Informatics (ICAI)","startPage":"155","endPage":"158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAI52893.2021.9639689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect inspection for front opening unified pods using a convolutional neural network","abstract":"Front opening unified pods (FOUPs) are containers designed to hold wafers securely when they are carried.

The node attributes of the graph include measured phase voltage and current measurements, and branch impedance, admittance and regulation parameters are integrated into link attributes of the graph. The fault locations are represented as output features of nodes for the graph, in which only terminal buses of faulted branch have non-zero values corresponding to faulted phases. The developed approach is applicable to both short-circuit faults and ground faults. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To enable the low latency requirements and to avoid the large overhead of communicating a large volume of time-sensitive data to central processing units, distributed and local processing of data is a promising approach that can improve system monitoring functions. Data-driven state estimation in power systems is an example of functions that can benefit from distributed processing of data and enhance the real-time monitoring of the system. In this paper, distributed state estimation is considered over multi-region, identified based on geographical distance and correlations among the state of the power system's components. Bayesian Multivariate Linear Regression (BMLR) combined with Auto-Regressive AR(p) process for distributed state estimation is considered over the multi-region power system. The performance of the distributed data-driven state estimation method and the role of regions are evaluated using the IEEE 118 test case under normal conditions as well as partially unobservable scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear regression","Distributed databases","Real-time systems","Phasor measurement units","Smart grids","Power systems","State estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed State Estimation","Smart Grid","Phasor Measurement Units","Cyber and Physical Stresses"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9639984","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9639895/9639896/09639984.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9639896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9639984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven, Multi-Region Distributed State Estimation for Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9639984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven, Multi-Region Distributed State Estimation for Smart Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9639984/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9639984/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2118510"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven, Multi-Region Distributed State Estimation for Smart Grids","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076789S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9639895","isNumber":"9639896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9639895","xplore-issue":"9639896","articleId":"9639984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"}]
