One consequence of technology having values is that it has a viewpoint, i.e., it ``frames'' reality according to these values. Because of technology's growing influence in society, the danger exists that this restricted manner of viewing reality could become accepted as the ``proper'' way to look at reality with the effect that other viewpoints would be attenuated or eliminated. Because of the bilateral nature of the interaction between society and technology, the occurrence of the dominance of the technological ethos would have repercussions for technology itself. In order for technology to prosper, it needs to be imbedded in a diverse cultural matrix. Thus, it is to the advantage of technology, as well as society, to be sure that the technological ethos maintains its proper sphere of influence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010049/","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Is Technology Neutral?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is Technology Neutral?","sourcePdf":"TAS-M-v5-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020944S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"5010038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"44","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5010049","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5010193,"authors":[{"name":"Barry W.

The presentation of the specification is in several stages, each new stage building on its predecessors; major concepts are introduced separately so that they may be easily understood. The notation used allows these separate stages to be joined together to give a complete description of each filing system operation-including its error conditions. Features of the specification notation are explained as they are used, and the Appendix gives the definitions of the symbols drawn from set theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5010210/05010215.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TSE.1984.5010215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1984.5010215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specification of the UNIX Filing System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Set theory","Operating systems","Standards publication","Calculus","Programming profession","Abstracts","Formal specifications","Documentation","Concrete"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Documentation","mathematical specification","set theory","UNIX"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","displayDocTitle":"Specification of the UNIX Filing System","volume":"SE-10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1984","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specification of the UNIX Filing System","sourcePdf":"TSE-vSE-10-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021825S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"5010210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"81","articleId":"5010215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5010246,"authors":[{"name":"Simon S.

A protocol system consists of a network of protocol entities and communication channels. Protocol entities interact by exchanging messages through channels; messages in transit may be lost, duplicated as well as reordered. Our method is intended for protocols with several distinguishable functions. We show how to construct image protocols for each function. An image protocol is specified just like a real protocol. An image protocol system is said to be faithful if it preserves all safety and liveness properties of the original protocol system concerning the projected function. An image protocol is smaller than the original protocol and can typically be more easily analyzed. Two protocol examples are employed herein to illustrate our method. An application of this method to verify a version of the high-level data link control (HDLC) protocol is described in a companion paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protocol Verification via Projections","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TSE.1984.5010246","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5010243/05010246.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1984.5010246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","displayDocTitle":"Protocol Verification via Projections","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"SE-10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"July 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protocol Verification via Projections","sourcePdf":"TSE-vSE-10-n4-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034025S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"5010243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"150","articleId":"5010246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5010248,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Weiser","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Weiser","id":"37313925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-5589"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3520"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3881"}],"articleNumber":"5010248","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1523,"citationCountPatent":33,"totalDownloads":1527},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Data mining","Probability density function","Merging","Program processors","Debugging","Algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data flow analysis","debugging","human factors","parallel processing","program maintenance","program metrics","slicing","software tools"]}],"abstract":"Program slicing is a method for automatically decomposing programs by analyzing their data flow and control flow.

A communication, or event, on any particular channel is represented by its input port's address, which the link encodes, conveys, and decodes. Previous work cut pad-count by transmitting row and column addresses sequentially, appending additional column addresses for concurrent communications in the same row, which are read and written in parallel, thereby boosting throughput. However, a non-DI implementation was used off-chip (bundled-data), incurring delay and area penalties when interfaced with DI circuitry used on-chip.

Bottlenecks can be difficult to find and correct, because their causes are diverse and often subtle. In this paper, we build on our method for performance analysis to develop a method for bottleneck identification and alleviation for pipelined asynchronous systems. More specifically, this paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a method that, given a throughput goal, identifies which parts of the pipelined system constrain its throughput. Each such bottleneck is categorized based on the type of structural transformation that could potentially alleviate it: increase degree of pipelining (stage splitting, stage duplication, and loop unrolling); decrease forward latency (stage merging and parallelization); and perform slack matching. The second contribution is a method that guides the user to systematically apply these modifications to alleviate the bottlenecks and reach a target throughput goal. We have validated the bottleneck analysis method on several examples and were able to attain the desired throughput goal in each case through iterative application of our bottleneck alleviation method. Runtimes were negligible in all cases (less than 50 ms).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Pipeline processing","Runtime","Clocks","Asynchronous circuits","USA Councils","Performance analysis","Delay","Merging","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottleneck detection","bottleneck elimination","design flow","high-throughput systems","pipelined asynchronous systems","structural transformation","stage splitting","stage duplication","loop unrolling","stage merging","slack matching","iterative application","hierarchically composed pipelined architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASYNC.2009.20","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5010320/5010321/05010349.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2009.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bottleneck Analysis and Alleviation in Pipelined Systems: A Fast Hierarchical Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bottleneck Analysis and Alleviation in Pipelined Systems: A Fast Hierarchical Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010349/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5010349/","accessionNumber":"10689299","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bottleneck Analysis and Alleviation in Pipelined Systems: A Fast Hierarchical Approach","confLoc":"Chapel Hill, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3616a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073862S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5010320","isNumber":"5010321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5010320","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5010321","articleId":"5010349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5010380,"authors":[{"name":"David Rosenbaum","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Portland State University, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rosenbaum","id":"37284750700"},{"name":"Marek Perkowski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Portland State University, USA"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Perkowski","id":"37282422900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3841-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3607-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0195-623X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2226"}],"articleNumber":"5010380","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"This paper presents a new quantum array that can be used to control a single-qudit Hermitian operator for an odd radix r > 2 by n controls using Theta(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">log</sup>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r+2</sup>\n) single-qudit controlled gates with one control and no ancilla qudits.

The first employs decision diagram techniques and the second uses Boolean satisfiability.

Applications utilizing numerical algorithms on large-size data sets require high-throughput computation platforms. The focus is on N-body interaction problems which have a wide range of applications spanning from astrophysics to molecular dynamics. The TANOR design flow starts with a MATLAB description of a particular interaction function, its parameters, and certain architectural constraints specified through a graphical user interface. Subsequently, TANOR automatically generates a configuration bitstream for a target FPGA along with associated drivers and control software necessary to direct the application from a host PC. Architectural exploration is facilitated through support for fully custom fixed-point and floating-point representations in addition to standard number representations such as single-precision floating point. Moreover, TANOR enables joint exploration of algorithmic and architectural variations in realizing efficient hardware accelerators. TANOR's capabilities have been demonstrated for three different N-body interaction applications: the calculation of gravitational potential in astrophysics, the diffusion or convolution with Gaussian kernel common in image processing applications, and the force calculation with vector-valued kernel function in molecular dynamics simulation. Experimental results show that TANOR-generated hardware accelerators achieve lower resource utilization without compromising numerical accuracy, in comparison to other existing custom accelerators.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5296580/05010433.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5296580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automated Framework for Accelerating Numerical Algorithms on Reconfigurable Platforms Using Algorithmic/Architectural Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010433/","displayDocTitle":"An Automated Framework for Accelerating Numerical Algorithms on Reconfigurable Platforms Using Algorithmic/Architectural Optimization","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10951114","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5010433/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automated Framework for Accelerating Numerical Algorithms on Reconfigurable Platforms Using Algorithmic/Architectural Optimization","sourcePdf":"ttc2009121654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103852S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5296580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5296580","articleId":"5010433","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5010435,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Sousa","affiliation":["Department de Informatica, Faculty Ciencias, University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5420346/5010435/5010435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paulo Sousa received the Licenciatura and PhD degrees in computer science from the University of Lisboa in 2001 and 2007, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that enhances proactive recovery with additional reactive mechanisms giving correct replicas the capability of recovering other replicas that are detected or suspected of being compromised. One key feature of our proactive-reactive recovery approach is that, despite recoveries, it guarantees the availability of a minimum number of system replicas necessary to sustain correct operation of the system. We design a proactive-reactive recovery service based on a hybrid distributed system model and show, as a case study, how this service can effectively be used to increase the resilience of an intrusion-tolerant firewall adequate for the protection of critical infrastructures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5420346/05010435.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Available Intrusion-Tolerant Services with Proactive-Reactive Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Production systems","Resilience","Computer Society","Upper bound","Protection","Power system security","Mission critical systems","SCADA systems","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","distributed processing","software fault tolerance","system recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion-tolerant replicated systems","fault production","system deployment time","proactive-reactive recovery service","hybrid distributed system model","intrusion-tolerant firewall"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion tolerance","proactive recovery","reactive recovery","firewall."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Highly Available Intrusion-Tolerant Services with Proactive-Reactive Recovery","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5010435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11151928","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Available Intrusion-Tolerant Services with Proactive-Reactive Recovery","sourcePdf":"ttd2010040452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094126S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5420346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5420346","articleId":"5010435","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5010436,"authors":[{"name":"Louis-Claude Canon","affiliation":["LORIA, INRIA, CNRS, Nancy University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Louis-Claude","lastName":"Canon","id":"37313136100"},{"name":"Emmanuel Jeannot","affiliation":["LORIA, INRIA, CNRS, Nancy University, Villers-les-Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Jeannot","id":"37273656300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"5010436","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Stochastic processes","Processor scheduling","Robust stability","Measurement","Context modeling","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","optimisation","scheduling","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness","optimization","evolutionary metaheuristic","heuristics making approximations","computation time","Pareto front","DAG schedules","heterogeneous environments","directed acyclic graph"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DAG","stochastic scheduling","robustness","makespan."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010436","abstract":"A schedule is said to be robust if it is able to absorb some degree of uncertainty in task or communication durations while maintaining a stable solution.

The major challenge of PPSs is the development of reliable on-board pedestrian detection systems. Due to the varying appearance of pedestrians (e.g., different clothes, changing size, aspect ratio, and dynamic shape) and the unstructured environment, it is very difficult to cope with the demanded robustness of this kind of system. Two problems arising in this research area are the lack of public benchmarks and the difficulty in reproducing many of the proposed methods, which makes it difficult to compare the approaches. As a result, surveying the literature by enumerating the proposals one--after-another is not the most useful way to provide a comparative point of view. Accordingly, we present a more convenient strategy to survey the different approaches. We divide the problem of detecting pedestrians from images into different processing steps, each with attached responsibilities. Then, the different proposed methods are analyzed and classified with respect to each processing stage, favoring a comparative viewpoint.

We propose to address this problem by using stereo matching to judge the similarity of two, 2D images of faces seen from different poses. Stereo matching allows for arbitrary, physically valid, continuous correspondences. We show that the stereo matching cost provides a very robust measure of similarity of faces that is insensitive to pose variations. To enable this, we show that, for conditions common in face recognition, the epipolar geometry of face images can be computed using either four or three feature points. We also provide a straightforward adaptation of a stereo matching algorithm to compute the similarity between faces. The proposed approach has been tested on the CMU PIE data set and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in the presence of pose variation. It also shows robustness to lighting variation.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5291213/05010439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291213","startPage":"2298","endPage":"2304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Stereo Matching with General Epipolar Geometry for 2D Face Recognition across Pose","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Stereo Matching with General Epipolar Geometry for 2D Face Recognition across Pose","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930882","pubMedId":"19834149","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5010439/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Stereo Matching with General Epipolar Geometry for 2D Face Recognition across Pose","sourcePdf":"ttp2009122298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090465S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5291213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5291213","articleId":"5010439","onlineDate":"29 May 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5010504,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmalendu Bikas Sinha","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Management, East Midnapur, West Bengal, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4939175/5010495/5010504/5010504-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Prof. Nirmalendu Bikas Sinha received the B.Sc (Honours in Physics), B.

Existing wireless systems may be utilized single frequency, single antenna and pulse for carrier transmission and reception. Problems of such system is that in case of failure the total system will become non operational. So we established a distributed system in terms of multi-carrier, multiantenna and coded pulse can provide a more suitable communication and sensor gives rise to DSSS-OFDM-MIMO based hybrid technology is the ultimate solution. This paper deals with the performance analysis of hybrid system to efficiently improve the link reliability/spectral efficiency of very high data rate communication systems. In this approach we interface DSSS to OFDM. Then we integrate this DSSS-OFDM to MIMO. This proposal is originally given for the operation in the 60 GHz band but without MIMO, if sufficient bandwidth is available. If the bandwidth is not available, we achieve the high throughput using MIMO) techniques. In particular, we apply MIMO detection methods based on Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space Time (V-BLAST) ordering techniques to hybrid systems with padding and without padding for different modulation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-DSSS provides both frequency diversity and spectral efficiency to yield a powerful solution to the ever-increasing requirement of high throughput cell phones and ITS.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Mobile communication","MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth","Throughput","Radio spectrum management","Transmitting antennas","Sensor systems","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency allocation","MIMO communication","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","spectral analysis","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation broad band mobile radio communications","multicarrier system","frequency allocation","wireless systems","DSSS-OFDM-MIMO based hybrid technology","reliability/spectral efficiency","high data rate communication systems","MIMO detection methods","Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space Time ordering techniques","V-BLAST systems","modulation techniques","frequency diversity","spectral efficiency","direct-sequence spread spectrum communication","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSSS","BER","PER","OFDM","V-BLAST","MIMO","TDMA","CCI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010504","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939175/5010495/05010504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid technology for next generation broad band mobile radio communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid technology for next generation broad band mobile radio communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010504/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5010504/","accessionNumber":"10688957","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid technology for next generation broad band mobile radio communications","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s01-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059631S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5010509,"authors":[{"name":"A.Y.

The systems that are designed based on CDMA are suffering from multiple access interference (MAI) problem. A lot of CDMA detectors are designed to overcome the (MAI) problem. But as the capability of CDMA detector in (MAI) cancellation increases, the complexity of the detector increases too. This paper gives a proposal of a new linear CDMA detector that has the same multiple access interference (MAI) cancellation capability as CDMA decorrelator detector. The structure complexity of this new proposed detector is as simple as the matched filter detector structure. Solving the (MAI) problem in CDMA system with simple detector structure at the receiver helps on increasing the CDMA system capacity. The new proposed detector operation is based on the symmetry property of CDMA signatures codes cross-correlation matrix.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5010509/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10688962","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New approach for designing CDMA linear decorrelator detector","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New approach for designing CDMA linear decorrelator detector","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s02-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059179S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5010524,"authors":[{"name":"Yousi Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yousi Zheng","id":"37311270700"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofeng Zhong","id":"37276292600"},{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave Digital Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Wan","id":"37306411400"},{"name":"Jianfeng Kang","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianfeng Kang","id":"37306917800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4704-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"5010524","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Scheduling algorithm","Quality of service","Throughput","Modulation coding","Resource management","Communication standards","Performance analysis","Job shop scheduling","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","scheduling","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain scheduling algorithm","IEEE 802.16 OFDMA systems","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","subchannel resource allocation algorithm","physical layer","AMC link adaptive mechanism","downlink mode","uplink mode","WiMax","FDSA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.16","AMC","frequency domain scheduling algorithm","link adaptive mechanism"]}],"abstract":"AMC (adaptive modulation and coding) is an important technology adopted by IEEE 802.16.

One solution is the limited feedback scheme where each user quantizes its channel with a fixed codebook and sends it back to the transmitter. There are two types of codebooks frequently discussed in IEEE 802.16e: 16e codebook and DFT codebook. Due to different design criterions, 16e codebook achieves a better performance in uncorrelated channel and DFT codebook is more suitable for correlated channel. Since the real environment is a combination of uncorrelated channel and correlated channel, we propose an adaptive codebook which adapt to different channel distribution. Our adaptive codebook is constructed with both 16e and DFT codebooks, where DFT codebook is employed to reconstruct the channel spatial correlation matrix and shift 16e codebook to fit the current channel. This adaptive codebook obviously outperforms both 16e and DFT codebooks in any channel distribution with only a negligible increase in overhead. Moreover, our adaptive codebook avoids complicated mathematic operation, which is very easy to be implemented in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939175/5010495/05010525.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive codebook for limited feedback MIMO system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Books","Transmitters","Downlink","Adaptive coding","Mathematics","Base stations","State feedback","Digital communication","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","broadband networks","correlation methods","discrete Fourier transforms","feedback","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)","radio access networks","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codebook","feedback MIMO system","multiplexing gain","channel knowledge","channel quantization","fixed codebook","IEEE 802.16e: 16e codebook","DFT codebook","correlated channel","uncorrelated channel","channel distribution","channel spatial correlation matrix","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["limited feedback","16e codebook","DFT codebook","adaptive","channel correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive codebook for limited feedback MIMO system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5010525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10688978","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive codebook for limited feedback MIMO system","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s05-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060299S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5010526,"authors":[{"name":"Jangsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jangsu Kim","id":"37311387500"},{"name":"Woo Min Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Woo Min Lee","id":"37309512100"},{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","id":"37278285300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4704-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"5010526","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Frequency conversion","MIMO","Wireless LAN","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Digital video broadcasting","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel allocation","channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","diversity reception","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","mobile radio","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-channel allocation","multiuser MIMO-OFDMA communication system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","broadband wireless multiple access communication","multiple antennas","space time coding","diversity reception","channel information estimation","decoding","mobile user","BER performance","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","subcarrier allocation","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has been used for broadband wireless multiple access.

In this paper, we propose a method to allocate the sub-carriers of mobile user at base station based on sub-channels gain. Data of each user is modulated on a set of sub-carriers in order to get maximum sub-channel gain.

The bit error rate (BER) performance of the CE-OFDM system with and without chaotic interleaving is evaluated by computer simulations.

In time varying channel model, the CDMA systems suffer from complex time varying channel's gains plus MAI and noise. A lot of CDMA detectors are designed to overcome the MAI problem. But these detectors have complex structures and their performances are affected by the presence of time varying channel's gains. This paper gives proposal for new linear CDMA detector that has the same MAI cancellation capability as CDMA decorrelator detector but with simpler structure. The operation of the new detector is based on the symmetry property of the cross-correlation matrix of CDMA signatures' codes. The structure complexity of this new detector is as simple as matched filter detector structure. The performance of this new detector is evaluated in the presence of Nakagami time varying channel's complex gains. Closed forms of probability of error for the proposed detector and decorrelator detector are represented for flat and multipath Nakagami fading models. Channel phase estimation error effect is included in the probability of error formulas.

We conclude that, decreasing the number of pumps, also decreases the ASE.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010542","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939175/5010495/05010542.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide band flat gain Raman amplifier for DWDM communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wide band flat gain Raman amplifier for DWDM communication systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5010542/","accessionNumber":"10688995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010542/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide band flat gain Raman amplifier for DWDM communication systems","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s09-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086707S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5010558,"authors":[{"name":"Zahid Ali","affiliation":["King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Zahid","lastName":"Ali","id":"38181846700"},{"name":"Mohammad Deriche","affiliation":["King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Deriche","id":"38307860500"},{"name":"Andan Andalusi","affiliation":["King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Andan","lastName":"Andalusi","id":"37303774800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4704-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"5010558","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Multiaccess communication","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Multiple access interference","Fading","Parameter estimation","Filtering","Tracking loops","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","Kalman filters","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channel estimation","CDMA networks","unscented kalman filter","multipath fading code division multiple access signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA Channel Estimation","Non-linear filtering","Kalman filters","Multipath","Multiple Access Interference"]}],"abstract":"The paper proposes a novel approach for time delay and channel gain estimation for multipath fading Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF).

However, non-linear distortions in the transmission chain can significantly compromise the performance of OFDM as they incur inter-channel interference. The light emitting diode (LED) is the main source for such distortions due to its nonlinear behavior. Distortion levels can be controlled when the LED operates in a quasi-linear segment of its characteristic around a bias point. The severity of non-linear distortions and the dependence of the bias point on the chosen digital modulation scheme are analyzed in this paper.

And the simulation results illustrate the excellent performance of this scheme even at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a multipath fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010587","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939175/5010495/05010587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010495","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A timing synchronization scheme for space-time cooperative relay OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A timing synchronization scheme for space-time cooperative relay OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010587/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10689040","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5010587/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A timing synchronization scheme for space-time cooperative relay OFDM system","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s18-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066733S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5010588,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However advantage of MIMO severely degrades in presence of strong Line of Sight (LOS) component. In theory various ways have been sought to improve the deficient channel rank such as pattern diversity and special antenna array structures. This paper introduces a framework to exploit benefits of MIMO and other spatial techniques in large scale communication networks (LSCN). The framework exploits the integration of the spatially diverse Multiple Antenna Sites (MAS), comprising the electromagnetic interface of an LSCN, into joint transmission\\reception systems. This integration enforces a virtual Non LOS environment, and gives the provision for exploiting the spatial dimension potentials. The potentials are realized as a result of diversity of the MAS(s) locations in the vector space. Thus an integrated system of an LSCN communicates to another LSCN system as two virtual Multi Element Antenna (MEA) systems. Alternatively an LSCN can be scaled into layers and MAS(s) integrated into subsystems to reduce hierarchy complexity and exploit the spatial potentials between these layers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications

this paper, simultaneous channel estimation, carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, and data decision are considered for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing

It is shown that the expectation maximization (EM) approach is complementary to the Kalman filter (KF) approach where the latter provides poor CFO estimation but good channel estimation and the former provides poor channel estimation but good CFO estimation. A hybrid combination of EM and KF approaches is proposed to take advantages of the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of both approaches. Numerical results have shown the hybrid combination is around 1.2 dB better than the non-hybrid approaches (EM or KF) in BER performances. The complexity of the hybrid approach is comparable to the KF approach and is much lower than the EM approach.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010589","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939175/5010495/05010589.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5010495","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid EM and KF receiver of MIMO OFDM systems in time-varying environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5010589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid EM and KF receiver of MIMO OFDM systems in time-varying environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5010589/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10689042","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5010589/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid EM and KF receiver of MIMO OFDM systems in time-varying environments","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"s18-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055337S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939175","isNumber":"5010495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939175","xplore-issue":"5010495","articleId":"5010589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5010590,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal O.

OFDMA method using adaptive modulation and coding technique can increase the system capacity many fold. In order to meet dynamic bandwidth requirement in downlink, an efficient resource allocation method called Two Stage Rate Adaptive (TSRA) algorithm is proposed here. The TSRA employs an adaptive modulation techniques and a Band Width Adaptation (BWA) algorithm to support the dynamic resource requirement of a multimedia traffic. The BWA is invoked dynamically by TSRA to deal with real-time variable bit rate services. It is observe that the simulated average system capacity exceeds 6 b/s per Hz, and approaches analytical/theoretical limit for increasing no of users. The delay performance is observed for existing and new arrival of multimedia traffic.

The most distinct feature of this approach is that it not only reduces the circuit critical path delay efficiently, but also takes congestion into account. The harmony between partitioning objective and timing improvement goal is kept; moreover, the congestion constraint is added to cost function to improve routability in the meantime. As a result, it avoids the excessive usage of local routing resources while remaining circuit performance much better. The experimental results show our method, FCTP, is very fast. It is able to produce solutions with equal or better routability and up to average 8.19% improvement on performance but only less 1/3 average runtime compared to TVPR [1]. It also achieves much better results than PPFF [7] in terms of timing and congestion with negligible runtime penalty.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Runtime","Timing","Circuit optimization","Electronic design automation and methodology","Cost function","Routing","Assembly","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast congestion-aware timing-driven placement","FPGA","fast timing-driven placement","partitioning-based method","critical path delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","fast congestion-aware placement","general alignment skill","timing-driven placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012092","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012092","startPage":"24","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957849/5012077/05012092.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012092/","displayDocTitle":"Fast congestion-aware timing-driven placement for island FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10690126","htmlLink":"/document/5012092/","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast congestion-aware timing-driven placement for island FPGA","confLoc":"Liberec, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066655S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957849","isNumber":"5012077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957849","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5012077","articleId":"5012092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5012107,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislaw Deniziak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Cracow University of Technology, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanislaw","lastName":"Deniziak","id":"37272102900"},{"name":"Mariusz Wisniewski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kielce University of Technology, Kielce, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Wisniewski","id":"37320362800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3341-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3340-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5012107","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Network synthesis","Circuit synthesis","Optimization methods","Encoding","Signal synthesis","Multivalued logic","Arithmetic","Design optimization","Algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic RTL synthesis","LUT","FPGA","multi-valued logic network","symbolic functional decomposition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a methodology of symbolic RTL synthesis, for circuits implemented in FPGA devices, is presented.

This algorithm reduces drastically the test application time (about 58% with respect to the well known Type-1 neighborhood) aiming to make the NPSF model also a cost attractive choice.

In this context, manufacturers must develop methods and design solutions to improve reliability especially for automotive applications. For this purpose, ECC and BISR are probably the most efficient concepts to enhance memory reliability. However, such techniques are limited to correct errors occurring punctually within a word whereas in memories the stress of peripheral circuit can lead to an entire faulty bit or word line. This phenomenon is referred as Clustering Effect. This work proposes an on-line testing structure for clustering effects according to the word line plan. This test structure allows achieving a test time acceptable and is shown as low cost in term of surface overhead (3 HV transistors, 1 XOR, 1 MUX and 1 DFF). Adding our solution to recent ECC and BISR techniques, spatial or automotive applications could be easily targeted.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012110","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957849/5012077/05012110.pdf","startPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-line testing scheme for repairing purposes in Flash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012110/","displayDocTitle":"An on-line testing scheme for repairing purposes in Flash memories","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10690143","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5012110/","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An on-line testing scheme for repairing purposes in Flash memories","confLoc":"Liberec, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045935S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957849","isNumber":"5012077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957849","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5012077","articleId":"5012110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5012124,"authors":[{"name":"Heimo Uhrmann","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Heimo","lastName":"Uhrmann","id":"37320727200"},{"name":"Franz Schlogl","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Schlogl","id":"37276420400"},{"name":"Kurt Schweiger","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Schweiger","id":"37320727700"},{"name":"Horst Zimmermann","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Measurements and Circuit Design, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Horst","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"37276432300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3341-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3340-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5012124","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012124","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Digital video broadcasting","Differential amplifiers","Robustness","Handheld computers","Low pass filters","System-on-a-chip","Feedforward systems","Gain","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital video broadcasting","feedforward amplifiers","low-pass filters","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers","system-on-chip","television receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","GBW operational amplifier","DVB-H receiver","mobile market","broad spectrum","handheld device","low-pass filter","system-on-chip","low-power CMOS","four-stage feed-forward nested Miller","gain-bandwidth","phase margin","digital video broadcasting for handheld","bandwidth 1 GHz","size 65 nm","gain 58 dB","capacitance 5 pF"]}],"abstract":"The offer of information grows rapidly in mobile markets.

A comparison with another dedicated method yields extremely encouraging results: with a comparable number of EMBs, the number of logic cells has been reduced by 95%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10690167","htmlLink":"/document/5012135/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Logic synthesis method for pattern matching circuits implementation in FPGA with embedded memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic synthesis method for pattern matching circuits implementation in FPGA with embedded memories","confLoc":"Liberec, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060523S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957849","isNumber":"5012077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957849","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5012077","articleId":"5012135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5012140,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Yufera","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla (IMSE), Centro Nacional de Microelectr\u00f3nica (CNM-CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Yufera","id":"37320422700"},{"name":"Adoracion Rueda","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla (IMSE), Centro Nacional de Microelectr\u00f3nica (CNM-CSIC), Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Adoracion","lastName":"Rueda","id":"37268065700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3341-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3340-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5012140","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":774},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Impedance measurement","Semiconductor device modeling","Circuit simulation","CMOS image sensors","Optical imaging","Image reconstruction","Biological system modeling","Electric variables measurement","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","cellular biophysics","CMOS integrated circuits","electric impedance imaging","electric impedance measurement","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS bio-impedance measurement system","2D processing","low-concentration cell culture","biological samples","impedance sensing method","electrode-to-cell model","electrical simulation","imaging reconstruction","electrical cell impedance spectroscopy","ECIS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bioimpedance","biometric circuits","CMOS analog circuits","bio-instrumentation","sensory systems"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS bio-impedance measurement system","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012077","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957849/5012077/05012140.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012140","startPage":"252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012140","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for bio-impedance measurement useful to 2D processing of cell cultures.

Therefore, the paper presents a general solution proposing both a basic architecture and a new project designed at the gate level that relies on parity prediction techniques. The contribution brought by our architecture consists of a complete separation between the functional and test channels. The conclusive arguments reveal the proposed architecture as a solution for area reduction; performance and power consumption are also analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957849/5012077/05012143.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Round-level concurrent error detection applied to Advanced Encryption Standard","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Hardware","Built-in self-test","Computer architecture","Testing","Power system security","Information security","Costs","Electronic mail","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["round-level concurrent error detection","advanced encryption standard","hardware architecture","built in self-test","parity control methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Round-level concurrent error detection applied to Advanced Encryption Standard","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5012143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10690175","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Round-level concurrent error detection applied to Advanced Encryption Standard","confLoc":"Liberec, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076024S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957849","isNumber":"5012077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957849","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5012077","articleId":"5012143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5012156,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Gu Lee","firstName":"Il-Gu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292232000"},{"name":"Junbo Son","lastName":"Junbo Son","id":"37306381400"},{"name":"Chanho Yoon","lastName":"Chanho Yoon","id":"37302732500"},{"name":"Eunyoung Choi","lastName":"Eunyoung Choi","id":"37291864100"},{"name":"Sok-Kyu Lee","firstName":"Sok-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281134600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2558-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2559-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"5012156","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Transceivers","Wireless LAN","Frequency estimation","Receiving antennas","Frequency domain analysis","MIMO","Hardware","Prototypes","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","MIMO-OFDM transceiver","high-data-rate performance","802.11n wireless LAN","bit rate 300 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"We present the design and implementation of a FPGA prototype for a 300Mbps 2 x 3 MIMO-OFDM transceiver that forms a complete IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN.

As a result, the proposed OFDM has much improved error performance as compared with the conventional scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new design of OFDM for ultra-wideband systems","publicationTitle":"2009 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2009.5012223","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939252/5012148/05012223.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2009.5012223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new design of OFDM for ultra-wideband systems","conferenceDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5012223/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10698179","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new design of OFDM for ultra-wideband systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"cr1156151726332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038825S","chronDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939252","isNumber":"5012148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939252","xplore-issue":"5012148","articleId":"5012223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5012228,"authors":[{"name":"David Halls","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Halls","id":"37320830200"},{"name":"Pierre Ferre","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Ferre","id":"37276846200"},{"name":"George Zaggoulos","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Zaggoulos","id":"37320832300"},{"name":"Andrew Nix","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Nix","id":"37276828100"},{"name":"Mark Beach","affiliation":["Centre of Communication Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Beach","id":"37270115800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2558-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2559-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"5012228","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cross layer design","MIMO","Wireless networks","WiMAX","Throughput","Quality of service","Physical layer","Streaming media","Protocols","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","broadband networks","IP networks","MIMO communication","quality of service","scheduling","video communication","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer interaction","IP centric video application","MIMO broadband wireless networks","QoS","quality of service","mobile WiMAX","channel-dependent scheduling","spectral efficiency","innovative 4G consumer application","nonlinear user preference","media-rich content distribution","mobile devices","eigen-beamforming solution"]}],"abstract":"Next generation mobile technologies must provide the throughput and QoS (quality of service) required for dasiatriple playpsila voice, data and media services.

The benefits of incorporating advanced MIMO techniques are demonstrated together with a novel approach to channel dependent scheduling. We employ cross-layer interaction to improve range and spectral efficiency. An innovative 4G consumer application is presented that offers a non-linear user preference based approach to media-rich content distribution to mobile devices.

We propose several receiver structures with the same oversampling ratio which reveal the same performance. If we increase the sampling rate above the symbol rate for the OFDM signal, subcarriers with higher frequencies than we want are obtained. Removing the unwanted higher frequency subcarriers means reducing the noise only subcarriers. By using this characteristic of OFDM signals, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain is obtained by the oversampling ratio compared to the receivers which use symbol rate sampling. Through computer simulations, we verify the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4939252/5012148/05012256.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2009 Digest of Technical Papers International Conference on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2009.5012256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2009.5012256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM receivers using oversampling with rational sampling ratios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Sampling methods","Signal to noise ratio","Digital video broadcasting","Bit error rate","Intersymbol interference","Wireless LAN","Frequency synchronization","Noise reduction","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","receivers","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM receivers","oversampling ratio","rational sampling ratios","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing receivers","symbol rate sampling","signal-to-noise ratio gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"OFDM receivers using oversampling with rational sampling ratios","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5012256/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10697963","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM receivers using oversampling with rational sampling ratios","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"cr1231114225746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044437S","chronDate":"10-14 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4939252","isNumber":"5012148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939252","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5012148","articleId":"5012256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5012258,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Cheol Jeon","affiliation":["Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Min-Cheol Jeon","id":"37304283200"},{"name":"Jun-Sil Chang","affiliation":["Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Sil Chang","id":"37310922200"},{"name":"Bo-Seok Seo","affiliation":["Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Bo-Seok Seo","id":"37321174300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2558-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2559-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"5012258","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a blind channel estimation method for advanced terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (AT-DMB) systems which use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with hierarchical subcarrier modulation. The AT-DMB system adopts hierarchical 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation to ensure backward-compatibility with the traditional T-DMB systems, which use differential quadrature phase shift keying for subcarrier modulation, and to support higher transmission rate. Due to the hierarchical modulation, the conventional T-DMB signal and the additional signal have different error rate at same signal to noise ratio. The proposed method exploits the reliability difference and weighs the decided symbols according to the reliability of them to improve the accuracy of the channel estimates.

Therefore, a variety of compact amplifier circuits has been realized by using an advanced 35 nm InAlAs/InGaAs based depletion-type metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (mHEMT) technology in combination with grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) circuit topology. A single-stage cascode design achieved a small-signal gain of 5.6 dB at 300 GHz and a linear gain of more than 5 dB between 258 and 308 GHz. Additionally, a four-stage amplifier S-MMIC based on conventional devices in common-source configuration was realized, demonstrating a maximum gain of 15.6 dB at 276 GHz and a linear gain of more than 12 dB over the frequency range from 264 to 300 GHz. Finally, mounting and packaging of the monolithic amplifier chips into H-band waveguide modules was accomplished with only minor reduction in circuit performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.2009.5012477","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Indium Phosphide & Related Materials","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Indium Phosphide & Related Materials","pdfPath":"/iel5/4957851/5012404/05012477.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.2009.5012477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5012404","startPage":"196","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 300 GHz mHEMT amplifier module","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5012477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 300 GHz mHEMT amplifier module","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5012477/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10688375","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5012477/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 300 GHz mHEMT amplifier module","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"WA1.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068768S","chronDate":"10-14 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4957851","isNumber":"5012404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4957851","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5012404","articleId":"5012477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
