An attractive property of the proposed method is that the direction generated by the method is always a descent direction for the objective function. This property is independent of the line search used. Moreover, if exact line search is used, the method reduces to the ordinary PRP method. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the modified PRP method with Armijo-type line search is globally convergent. We also present extensive preliminary numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1093/imanum/drl016","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","startPage":"629","endPage":"640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imanum/drl016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8161125","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016799/8161125/08161135.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PRP method","MPRP method","Armijo-type line search","global convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A descent modified Polak\u2013Ribi\u00e8re\u2013Polyak conjugate gradient method and its global convergence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8161135/","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A descent modified Polak\u2013Ribi\u00e8re\u2013Polyak conjugate gradient method and its global convergence","sourcePdf":"drl016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023657S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"8161125","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016799","citationCount":"12","articleId":"8161135","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-04"},{"_id":8163849,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Such a system may emit many EMRBs before eventually completing the inspiral. There are several nearby galaxies that could yield detectable bursts.

However, state-of-the-art deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are demanding so much on-chip storage and compute resources that they cannot be smoothly handled by low-power mobile or embedded systems. In order to fit large CNN models into mobile or more cutting-edge devices for IoT or cyberphysics applications, we proposed an efficient on-chip memory architecture for CNN inference acceleration, and showed its application to in-house single-instruction multiple-data structure machine learning processor. The redesigned on-chip memory subsystem, Memsqueezer, includes an active weight buffer and data buffer set that embraces specialized compression methods to reduce the footprint of CNN parameters (weights) and activation data, respectively. Memsqueezer buffer can compress the data and weight set according to the dataflow in computation, and it also includes a built-in redundancy detection mechanism that actively scans through the working-set of CNNs to boost their inference performance by eliminating the computation redundancy in CNN models. In our experiments, it is shown that the CNN processors with Memsqueezer buffers achieve more than 2\u00d7 performance improvement and reduces 85% energy consumption on average over the conventional buffer design with the same area budget.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2017.2778060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8467416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2017.2778060","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8467416/08165964.pdf","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Case of On-Chip Memory Subsystem Design for Low-Power CNN Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Case of On-Chip Memory Subsystem Design for Low-Power CNN Accelerators","volume":"37","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8165964/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18080133","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8165964/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61432017, 61504153, 61532017, 61402146 and 61521092"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFF0203500"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Case of On-Chip Memory Subsystem Design for Low-Power CNN Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tcad-wang-2778060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085605S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8467416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8467416","articleId":"8165964","onlineDate":"04 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8165971,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-68303-113-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8165971","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3297},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"32NF -

The work results and the paper conclusions reveal advantage of our approach versus the uniform circular antenna array. Also an important result is the reduction of the number of variables in the fitness function, which creates good premises for the implementation of real-time algorithms useful in complex/dynamic

Test case reduction is one of the widely used techniques for regression testing, which can dramatically decrease the testing costs. However, it is an NP-complete problem and big test cases cannot be accomplished in reasonable amount of time. For this reason, we propose a test suite reduction approach by using greedy and genetic algorithms. The greedy algorithm found a wide usage in previous studies thanks to its simplicity, but we already know that it sticks to local optima and does not benefit from metaheuristics. Thus, we used genetic algorithm to overcome its weaknesses. Our experimental results prove that metaheuristics and evolutionary algorithms perform better than the greedy approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ECAI.2017.8166445","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119309/8166382/08166445.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECAI.2017.8166445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving test suite reduction problem using greedy and genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2017-July 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Solving test suite reduction problem using greedy and genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415523","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166445/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving test suite reduction problem using greedy and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Targoviste, Romania","sourcePdf":"PID4850627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095523S","chronDate":"June 29 2017-July 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119309","isNumber":"8166382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119309","xplore-issue":"8166382","articleId":"8166445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8166450,"authors":[{"name":"Mariana-Eugenia Ilas","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics, Telecommunications and IT University \u201cPolitehnica\u201d of Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Mariana-Eugenia","lastName":"Ilas","id":"37601531400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6458-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6457-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6456-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6459-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8166450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166450","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automobiles","Classification algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays","Support vector machines","Histograms","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image classification","interpolation","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["original histogram of oriented gradients algorithm","car detection","FPGA implementation","HOG algorithm simplification","FPGA area","classification performance","bin interpolation step","aggressive simplification","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Histogram of oriented gradients \u2014 HOG","autonomous ground vehicle","perception","car classification","Support vector machine classifier \u2014 SVM","Field programmable gate array \u2014 FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose and investigate some simplifications to the original Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm, in order to allow a more efficient hardware implementation, while keeping the overall classification accuracy.

The input data consists of a list of processes and their hierarchy, the goal is to create patterns of normal computer behavior and malicious computer behavior; these patterns will be used to train an artificial neural network to alert on newly created processes and automatically establish if they are safe or can cause harm to the computer and its data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2017-July 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166505/","accessionNumber":"17415550","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8166505/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic analysis of malware using artificial neural networks: Applying machine learning to identify malicious behavior based on parent process hirarchy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic analysis of malware using artificial neural networks: Applying machine learning to identify malicious behavior based on parent process hirarchy","confLoc":"Targoviste, Romania","sourcePdf":"PID4928329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034928S","chronDate":"June 29 2017-July 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119309","isNumber":"8166382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119309","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8166382","articleId":"8166505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8166621,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjun Cai","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chengjun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086100629"},{"name":"Xingliang Yuan","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xingliang","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085366042"},{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086288737"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1027-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1028-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8166621","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1064},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Robustness","Peer-to-peer computing","Keyword search","Encryption","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","data structures","distributed processing","peer-to-peer computing","protocols","query processing","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed storage platforms","high reliability","scalability","data privacy","production systems","content search","searchable encryption","distributed hash table","malicious nodes","verifiable data structure","encrypted search","distributed network","verifiable search queries","blockchain","trusted nodes","encrypted keyword search","distributed hardening","data handling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166621","abstract":"Distributed storage platforms draw much attention due to their high reliability and scalability for handling a massive amount of data. To protect user and data privacy, encryption is considered as a necessary feature for production systems like Storj. But it prohibits the nodes from performing content search. To preserve the functionality, we observe that a protocol of integration with searchable encryption and keyword search via distributed hash table allows the nodes in a network to search over encrypted and distributed data. However, this protocol does not address a practical threat in a fully distributed scenario. Malicious nodes would sabotage search results, and easily infiltrate the system as the network grows. Using primitives such as MAC and verifiable data structure may empower the users to verify the search result, but the robustness of the overall system can hardly be ensured. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a protocol that is seamlessly incorporated to encrypted search in distributed network to attest and monitor nodes. From the moment a node joins the system, it will be attested and continuously monitored through verifiable search queries. The result of each attestation is determined via a standard quorum-based voting protocol, and then recorded on the blockchain as a consensus view of trusted nodes. Based on the proposed protocols, malicious nodes can be detected and removed by a majority of nodes in a self-determining manner. To demonstrate the security and efficiency, we conduct robustness analysis against several potential attacks, and perform performance and overhead evaluation on the proposed protocol.","doi":"10.1109/PAC.2017.36","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Symposium on Privacy-Aware Computing (PAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Symposium on Privacy-Aware Computing (PAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8126807/8166602/08166621.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAC.2017.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardening Distributed and Encrypted Keyword Search via Blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardening Distributed and Encrypted Keyword Search via Blockchain","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17428012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166621/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166621/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Aug. 2017","conferenceDate":"1-4 Aug. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardening Distributed and Encrypted Keyword Search via Blockchain","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"1027a119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052154S","chronDate":"1-4 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8126807","isNumber":"8166602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8126807","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8166602","articleId":"8166621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166697,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Edison Lascano","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Utah State University, Logan, USA","Departamento de Ciencias de la Computacion, Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador"],"firstName":"Jorge Edison","lastName":"Lascano","id":"37086333106"},{"name":"Stephen Wright Clyde","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Utah State University, Logan, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen Wright","lastName":"Clyde","id":"38536154000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2536-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2537-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-570X"}],"articleNumber":"8166697","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Programming profession","Education","Software as a service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","computer science education","educational institutions","human factors","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Computer Science education","graduate class","acquired A2R skills","ANOVA statistical analysis","Utah State University","Computer Science Department","analysis-to-reuse skills","programming assignments","Cloud Computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer science education","software engineering education","programming","cloud computing","observational study"]}],"abstract":"In an earlier study, we observed that students in a small graduate class who used Cloud Computing (CC) for their programming assignments improved their analysis-to-reuse (A2R) skills more than students who didn't use CC.

We compared these methods by assessing the degree of correctness and completeness of the produced diagrams. We analyzed students' perceptions about each method. The quantitative results showed that the diagrams created using both methods presented similar level of correctness and completeness.

First, an equivalent disturbed fuzzy dynamic model with the varying parameters is constructed to approximate the nonlinear dynamics, where the inevitable lumped disturbances, including the fuzzy modeling error, extraneous disturbances, and model uncertainties caused by aerodynamic uncertainties, need to be suppressed. Subsequently, according to the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, the proposed scheme taking the varying parameters into account is developed to explicitly handle the constraints of fuel equivalence ratio, elevator deflection, and angle of attack. Furthermore, based on the strong nonlinear approximation ability of neural network (NN), an adaptive neural network disturbance observer with the adaptive laws of NN's weight matrixes is established to estimate lumped disturbances, and then an additional compensator formulated by integrating the estimations of lumped disturbances and the corresponding compensation gain matrix is appended to the proposed method for suppressing the lumped disturbances directly. Finally, the comparative simulation results for tracking the reference commands of velocity and altitude demonstrate that the proposed method provides a satisfactory tracking performance even when HV is in the presence of lumped disturbances and constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780118","startPage":"5927","endPage":"5938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In this letter, we propose a price-based distributed method to manage the offloaded computation tasks from users. A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interaction between the edge cloud and users, where the edge cloud sets prices to maximize its revenue subject to its finite computation capacity, and for given prices, each user locally makes offloading decision to minimize its own cost which is defined as latency plus payment. Depending on the edge cloud's knowledge of the network information, we develop the uniform and differentiated pricing algorithms, which can both be implemented in distributed manners.

There is a high possibility that these existing methods will encounter more challenges and issues in relation to network dynamics, resulting in a high overhead in the network response time, leading to latency and traffic. In order to avoid these problems in the network and achieve an optimum level of resource utilization, a new paradigm called edge computing (EC) is proposed to pave the way for the evolution of new age applications and services. With the integration of EC, the processing capabilities are pushed to the edge of network devices such as smart phones, sensor nodes, wearables, and on-board units, where data analytics and knowledge generation are performed which removes the necessity for a centralized system. Many IoT applications, such as smart cities, the smart grid, smart traffic lights, and smart vehicles, are rapidly upgrading their applications with EC, significantly improving response time as well as conserving network resources. Irrespective of the fact that EC shifts the workload from a centralized cloud to the edge, the analogy between EC and the cloud pertaining to factors such as resource management and computation optimization are still open to research studies. Hence, this paper aims to validate the efficiency and resourcefulness of EC. We extensively survey the edge systems and present a comparative study of cloud computing systems. After analyzing the different network properties in the system, the results show that EC systems perform better than cloud computing systems. Finally, the research challenges in implementing an EC system and future research directions are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08166730.pdf","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge of Things: The Big Picture on the Integration of Edge, IoT and the Cloud in a Distributed Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Edge of Things: The Big Picture on the Integration of Edge, IoT and the Cloud in a Distributed Computing Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166730/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17542708","htmlLink":"/document/8166730/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Edge of Things: The Big Picture on the Integration of Edge, IoT and the Cloud in a Distributed Computing Environment","sourcePdf":"access-prasad-2780087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138124S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8166730","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166731,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Syrytsin","affiliation":["Section of Antennas, Propagation, and Millimeter-Wave Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8166731/syryt-2779792-small.gif","p":["Igor Syrytsin was born in Saratov, Russia, in 1988.

In the switch diversity antenna array, there is only one element out of eight operating each time. The paper is carried out in data mode with a standing user, which includes both body blockage and user hand effects. The metrics of coverage efficiency, antenna shadowing power ratio, and isotropic antenna shadowing power ratio are utilized in the investigation. It is found that the scan angle of a phased array higher than 90\u00b0 is not necessary for this scenario, because the user body will contribute to the total radiation at large angles by scattering the radiated energy around the body. For the linear phased antenna arrays on the edge of the mobile device ground plane, it can be concluded that in order to achieve the highest coverage efficiency and lowest user shadowing it is more beneficial to use a phased array instead of a switch diversity array. However, if the losses of the phase shifters and the feeding network from the phased array are higher than 5 dB, the switch array can be used, which will also decrease the complexity of a system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08166731.pdf","startPage":"1616","endPage":"1623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Impact on Phased and Switch Diversity Arrays in 5G Mobile Terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"User Impact on Phased and Switch Diversity Arrays in 5G Mobile Terminals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166731/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17573756","htmlLink":"/document/8166731/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Innovations Fonden Project of RANGE"},{"fundingName":"AAU Young Talent Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"User Impact on Phased and Switch Diversity Arrays in 5G Mobile Terminals","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2779792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061944S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8166731","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166732,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-4588-8475","id":"37086337953"},{"name":"Guangming Dai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0002-1787-3794","id":"37086339096"},{"name":"Gerhard Reinelt","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Reinelt","orcid":"0000-0002-7193-501X","id":"37995610500"},{"name":"Maocai Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Maocai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539555700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8166732","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Earth","Planetary orbits","Computational modeling","Satellite constellations","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","satellite communication","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed integer linear programming model","improved 0/1 programming model","coverage constraints","optimization efficiency","semianalytical method","periodic Earth coverage satellites optimization","satellite constellations","limited resource capabilities","periodic coverage requirements","repeating ground-track orbit","coverage capacity","random spot target","Earth surface","Earth revisit mission sequence","ascending node","MILP model","search space size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite communication","coverage analysis","constellation design","modelling","optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address a problem of designing satellite constellations to deal with a sequence of Earth revisit missions in the presence of limited resource capabilities.

Due to their main benefits in the reduction of deployment and maintenance costs, large flexibility and possible enhancement of safety, WNCS are becoming a fundamental infrastructure technology for critical control systems in automotive electrical systems, avionics control systems, building management systems, and industrial automation systems. The main challenge in WNCS is to jointly design the communication and control systems considering their tight interaction to improve the control performance and the network lifetime. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of the literature on wireless network design and optimization for WNCS. First, we discuss what we call the critical interactive variables including sampling period, message delay, message dropout, and network energy consumption. The mutual effects of these communication and control variables motivate their joint tuning. We discuss the analysis and design of control systems taking into account the effect of the interactive variables on the control system performance. Moreover, we discuss the effect of controllable wireless network parameters at all layers of the communication protocols on the probability distribution of these interactive variables. We also review the current wireless network standardization for WNCS and their corresponding methodology for adapting the network parameters. Finally, we present the state-of-the-art wireless network design and optimization for WNCS, while highlighting the tradeoff between the achievable performance and complexity of various approaches. We conclude the survey by highlighting major research issues and identifying future research directions.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2780114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8362823/08166737.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"1013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8362823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2780114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Network Design for Control Systems: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166737","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/8362823/8166737-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2018","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Network Design for Control Systems: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166737/","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17829217","htmlLink":"/document/8166737/","volume":"20","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Research Laboratory of the National Research Foundation through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A4A1015744 and NRF-2016R1C1B1008049"},{"fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences within the Young Scientist Award Program"},{"fundingName":"SRA TNG ICT Project TOUCHES"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1320921 (NeTS) and 1646579 (CPS)"},{"fundingName":"Fullgraf Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001729","fundingName":"Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Wireless Network Design for Control Systems: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-park-2780114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.279413S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8362823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"8362823","articleId":"8166737","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166741,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Presently, the commonly used algorithms face constraints, such as high computational cost and lack of optimal feature selection on application to real time signals thereby reducing the efficiency of such analysis. Deep learning approaches, such as the convolution neural network, overcome these drawbacks by calculating automated features from raw signal and classifying the derived features. This architecture shows good merits. However, the use of fully connected multi-layer perceptron algorithms have shown low classification performance. This paper proposes to develop a modified deep learning convolution neural network algorithm integrated with support vector machines to address the drawbacks present in multi-layer perceptron and thereby improving the overall performance of real-time detection applications. The system is validated on real-time breath signals for non-invasive detection of diabetes. The performance of this proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with the existing technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel 1-D Convolution Neural Network With SVM Architecture for Real-Time Detection Applications","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2780178","startPage":"724","endPage":"731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2780178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8233344/08166741.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel 1-D Convolution Neural Network With SVM Architecture for Real-Time Detection Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8166741/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17447895","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel 1-D Convolution Neural Network With SVM Architecture for Real-Time Detection Applications","sourcePdf":"jsen-m-2780178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060779S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8233344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8233344","articleId":"8166741","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8166742,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Freudenberger","affiliation":["Institute for System Dynamics, HTWG Konstanz, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Freudenberger","orcid":"0000-0002-5913-4981","id":"37269391900"},{"name":"Daniel Rohweder","affiliation":["Institute for System Dynamics, HTWG Konstanz, University of Applied Sciences, Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rohweder","id":"37086393602"},{"name":"Sergo Shavgulidze","affiliation":["Faculty of Power Engineering and Telecommunications, Georgian Technical University, Tbilisi, Georgia"],"firstName":"Sergo","lastName":"Shavgulidze","orcid":"0000-0001-9236-0772","id":"37268527900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8166742","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constellation diagram","Transmitting antennas","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized multistream spatial modulation","modified suboptimal detection algorithm","signal-to-noise ratios","signal constellations","Hurwitz integers","low-complexity detection","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","MIMO","spatial modulation","lattices","signal detection"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes two contributions to improve the performance of transmission with generalized multistream spatial modulation (SM).

Better locality translates to shorter decoding latency, which is essential to many new applications, such as failure recovery in distributed storage. The shared parities can be allocated in multiple layers to improve the locality. However, existing work only generalized two-layer II codes to allow multiple interleaves with extra errors to be corrected. For three or more layers, the shared parities in a layer only provide extra protection over one of the interleaves or subgroups they cover in the next lower layer. This letter proposes a construction of generalized three-layer II codes. In our codes, the shared parities can be used to correct multiple interleaves in each subgroup and the allocation of their correction power among the interleaves is flexible. Our scheme corrects much more error patterns than the prior three-layer II codes, and achieves better locality than the two-layer GII codes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2780132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8309483/08166744.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2780132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Three-Layer Integrated Interleaved Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Three-Layer Integrated Interleaved Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166744/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17614430","htmlLink":"/document/8166744/","volume":"22","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Three-Layer Integrated Interleaved Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2780132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053303S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8309483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8309483","articleId":"8166744","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166753,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Hern\u00e1Ndez-Orallo","affiliation":["Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica de Sistemas y Computadores, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8166753/herna-2779748-small.gif","p":["Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez Orallo received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia (UPV), Spain, in 1992 and 2001, respectively.

Communications in mobile opportunistic networks take place upon the establishment of ephemeral contacts among mobile nodes using direct communication. In this paper, we propose an analytical model based on population processes to evaluate data dissemination considering several parameters, such as user density, contact rate, and the number of fixed nodes. From this model, we obtain closed-form expressions for determining the diffusion time, the network coverage, and the waiting time. Newer 5G wireless technologies, such as WiGig, can offer multi-gigabit speeds, low latency, and security-protected connectivity between nearby devices. We therefore focus our work on the impact of high-speed and short-range wireless communications technologies for data dissemination in mobile opportunistic networks. Moreover, we test whether the coexistence with a fixed infrastructure can improve content dissemination, and thus justify its additional cost. Our results show that, when user density is high, the diffusion is mainly performed through the opportunistic contacts between mobile nodes, and that the diffusion coverage is close to 100%. Moreover, the diffusion is fast enough to dynamically update the information among all the participating members, so users do not need to get closer to fixed spots for receiving updated information.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779748","startPage":"1603","endPage":"1615","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08166753.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Model Based on Population Processes to Characterize Data Dissemination in 5G Opportunistic Networks","topic":"Tunable devices for modern communications: materials, integration, modeling, and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model Based on Population Processes to Characterize Data Dissemination in 5G Opportunistic Networks","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8166753/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17573761","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166753/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad, Spain","grantNumber":"TEC2014-52690-R, MTM 2016-75963-P and SEV-2013-0323"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003359","fundingName":"Generalitat Valenciana, Spain","grantNumber":"AICO/2015/108 and ACOMP/2015/005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Analytical Model Based on Population Processes to Characterize Data Dissemination in 5G Opportunistic Networks","sourcePdf":"access-conejero-2779748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1277S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Tunable devices for modern communications: materials, integration, modeling, and applications"],"articleId":"8166753","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8166758,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Sik Choi","affiliation":["Intel Labs, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8166758/choi-2780121-small.gif","p":["Jeong-Sik Choi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering\n from the Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea, in 2010, and the M.S. and Ph.

For this purpose, channel state information (CSI) obtained by commodity IEEE 802.11n devices can be used, because it contains information about channel impulse response (CIR). However, because of the limited sampling rate of the devices, a high-resolution CIR is not available, and it is difficult to detect the existence of an LOS path from a single CSI measurement, but it can be inferred from the variation pattern of CSI over time. To this end, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, which takes a series of CSI to identify the corresponding channel condition. We collect numerous measurement data under an indoor office environment, train the proposed RNN model, and compare the performance with those of existing schemes that use handcrafted features. The proposed method efficiently learns a nonlinear relationship between input and output, and thus, yields high accuracy even for data obtained in a very short period.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699040","htmlLink":"/document/8166758/","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based NLOS Identification With Commodity WLAN Devices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korean Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1A2A2A03008195"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based NLOS Identification With Commodity WLAN Devices","sourcePdf":"tvt-kim-2780121-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080105S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8166758","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8166763,"authors":[{"name":"Satadru Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/8633581/8166763/dey-2776218-small.gif","p":["Satadru Dey (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the master\u2019s degree in control systems from IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in automotive engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA, in 2015.","From 2010 to 2012, he was a Control Engineer with General Electric Company, Hyderabad, India.

Out of many possible degradation modes, thermal faults constitute a significant part of critical causes that lead to battery degradation and failure. Therefore, it is extremely important to diagnose these thermal faults in real time to ensure battery safety. Motivated by this fact, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model-based real-time scheme in this paper for diagnosing thermal faults in Li-ion batteries. The objective of the diagnostic scheme is to detect and estimate the size of the thermal fault. We utilize a distributed parameter 1-D thermal model for cylindrical battery cells in conjunction with PDE observer-based techniques to design the scheme. Furthermore, we apply threshold-based technique to ensure robustness against modeling and measurement uncertainties. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated by: 1) analytical convergence verification of the PDE observers under heathy and faulty conditions utilizing Lyapunov stability theory; 2) extensive simulation case studies; 3) robustness analysis against model parametric uncertainties; and 4) experimental studies on a commercial Li-ion battery cell.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/87/8633581/8166763-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18439060","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8166763/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Battery Thermal Fault Diagnostics: Algorithms, Analysis, and Experiments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1408107"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Model-Based Battery Thermal Fault Diagnostics: Algorithms, Analysis, and Experiments","sourcePdf":"tcst-dey-2776218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135418S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8633581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8633581","articleId":"8166763","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8166768,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University (Baoding Campus), Hebei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8412378/8166768/yu-2780191-small.gif","p":["Yang Yu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from North\n China Electric Power University, Baoding, China, in 2005, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an\n Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from North China\n Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2016.","He is currently working as an Associate Professor in North China Electric Power University.

In a stator current vector oriented coordinate system d*q*o, the dynamic model of SPMSM is established. Based on analysis of control performance for conventional open-loop I - f control, the control framework of closed-loop I - f control is presented and closed-loop regulators of angle, speed, and current are derived. Additionally, the adaptation law estimating totally unknown parameters of SPMSM is simultaneously accomplished in the design of controller and avoids construction of estimation algorithm separately. The stability of the controller is proved in the sense of Lyapunov theory. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified through both simulations and hardware experiments. The results indicate that the improved control scheme ensures the speed to track the expected value rapidly and stably in different load conditions, and the current amplitude is regulated to enlarge with the increasing of load torque automatically. Furthermore, fully unknown parameters are estimated precisely and reverse rotation of motor at startup enables to be prevented effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17935417","volume":"33","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8166768/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Stator Current Oriented Closed-Loop <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I\\text{--} f$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Control of Sensorless SPMSM With Fully Unknown Parameters for Reverse Rotation Prevention","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407077"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017MS095"},{"fundingName":"Independent Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources of China","grantNumber":"LAPS2016-28"},{"fundingName":"Headquarter of Science and Technology Project for Sate Grid Corporation of China","grantNumber":"5204BB16000F"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stator Current Oriented Closed-Loop <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I\\text{--} f$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Control of Sensorless SPMSM With Fully Unknown Parameters for Reverse Rotation Prevention","sourcePdf":"tpel-yu-2780191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109525S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8412378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8412378","articleId":"8166768","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8166770,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Ki Yoo","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K.","Centre for Data Science, Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9512856/8166770/yoo-2780110-small.gif","p":["Seong Ki Yoo (S\u201914\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Eng.

The best way for realizing such a differentiator has so far proved to be an indirect nonideal generalized integrator (GI). As a simple alternative, this paper proposes two digital differentiators, which are directly developed in the discrete domain. They are a first-order differentiator based on backward Euler plus digital lead compensator and a second-order differentiator based on Tustin plus digital notch filter. The basic idea of the proposed methods is to correct their frequency responses to match the ideal differentiator with embedded digital filters. It is shown that the proposed differentiators exhibit the same derivative performance as the nonideal-GI differentiator, and they are more attractive for digital implementations due to their direct discrete natures, compact expressions, and easy algebraic manipulations. In particular, the proposed first-order differentiator is most competitive for its general representation and simplest implementation. Finally, a 12-kW prototype is built, and experiments are performed to verify the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166772/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17935398","volume":"33","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Direct Realization of Digital Differentiators in Discrete Domain for Active Damping of <i>LCL </i>-Type Grid-Connected Inverter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"50837003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Realization of Digital Differentiators in Discrete Domain for Active Damping of <italic>LCL </italic>-Type Grid-Connected Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-pan-2780174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096203S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8412378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8412378","articleId":"8166772","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8166775,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8166775/wang-2780119-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang received the Ph.D. degree in communications and information\n systems from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2014.

However, as a population-based search method, the CE method requires large samples to find a high-quality solution, which means higher complexity and more time consuming concerning convergence. To reduce the complexity while achieving promising PAPR performance, an improved CE based TI scheme is proposed in this paper. First, a structured extended constellation for rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation is designed to provide more freedom degrees. With proper parameter selection, the proposed extended constellation can offer more design flexibilities and achieve a better tradeoff between freedom degree and power increase. Then, by analyzing the impact of the subcarrier candidate population on the conventional CE based TI scheme, we derive an explicit expression for the determination of the size of the subcarrier candidate population. And, based on the prior information carried by the clipping signal, proper candidate subcarriers are selected. Finally, an improved CE based TI scheme is proposed, which can efficiently enhance the solution quality and greatly accelerate the convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate that the improved CE based TI scheme achieves great improvements on the performance of PAPR, bit error rate, power increase and complexity compared with the conventional CE based TI scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2780119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08166775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2780119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","startPage":"3284","endPage":"3294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Cross-Entropy-Based Tone Injection Scheme With Structured Constellation Extension Design for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Cross-Entropy-Based Tone Injection Scheme With Structured Constellation Extension Design for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699015","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8166775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701364"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M602773"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Network","grantNumber":"ISN090105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Cross-Entropy-Based Tone Injection Scheme With Structured Constellation Extension Design for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"tvt-hu-2780119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137785S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8166775","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8166780,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjan K.

The amount of training, which is quantified by the fractional pilot duration for a fixed-length pilot-plus-data frame, should be kept as low as possible for saving bandwidth and increasing data rate. However, reducing training leads to degraded error performance due to poor CSI estimate although it increases data rate, while increasing training improves error performance but reduces data rate. Expressing the tradeoff between symbol error probability (SEP) and data rate by the normalized error-free data rate, we present an analytical framework for its maximization with respect to pilot symbol duration fraction in a pilot-aided single-input multiple-output wireless communication system with reception over independent and identically distributed flat Rayleigh fading diversity branches, employing M -ary phase-shift keying, and using maximal-ratio combining. Closed-form expressions for the approximate optimal pilot symbol duration fraction are derived for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) case. Numerical results are presented to highlight the system behavior with changes in parameters like SNR, pilot symbol quality, and number of receive diversity branches. It is found that the optimization maximizes normalized error-free data rate with close to minimum SEP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166780/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699088","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Pilot Duration Optimization for SIMO in Rayleigh Fading With MPSK and Imperfect CSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Pilot Duration Optimization for SIMO in Rayleigh Fading With MPSK and Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tcomm-mallik-2780100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088349S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8166780","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8166782,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Nabeel","affiliation":["Heinz Nixdorf Institute and Department of Computer Science, Paderborn University, Paderborn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8360432/8166782/nabee-2780196-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Nabeel received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2013.

In contrast to other approaches, we fully rely on diversity combining on signal level by introducing selective sample forwarding to a centralized receiver. That way, we use the WSN as a distributed antenna array and still take the rather limited data rates between the sensor nodes into consideration. In particular, we consider a distributed ground network in the wild to track bats in their natural habitat. The bats are equipped with a sensor node of only 2 g, which limits the energy budget available for communication. The main challenges to be addressed are the limited bandwidth between nodes and the need for accurate time synchronization to combine signal copies constructively at a central node. We study the performance based on a GNU Radio implementation both in simulations as well as in laboratory experiments. Our results clearly indicate a substantial performance gain while keeping the data rate in the distributed sensor network in a feasible range.","doi":"10.1109/TGCN.2017.2780196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2017.2780196","startPage":"336","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/7511293/8360432/08166782.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8360432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Receive Diversity in Distributed Sensor Networks Using Selective Sample Forwarding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Receive Diversity in Distributed Sensor Networks Using Selective Sample Forwarding","publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 May 2018","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8166782/","accessionNumber":"17768606","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166782/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation","grantNumber":"FOR 1508"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Receive Diversity in Distributed Sensor Networks Using Selective Sample Forwarding","sourcePdf":"tgcn-dressler-2780196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065597S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8360432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8360432","articleId":"8166782","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8166785,"authors":[{"name":"Thu Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Wayne State University, Detroit, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8259379/8166785/nguye-2780113-small.gif","p":["Thu Nguyen received the B.Sc degree in mathematics and computer\n sciences from the University of Sciences HCM VNU, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2008, the M.Sc degree in applied\n mathematics from the University of Orl\u00e9ans, Orl\u00e9ans, France, in 2010, and the Ph.D degree in statistical\n signal processing from Lille 1 University\u2014Science and Technology, Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq, France, in 2014.

Random features of wireless communications introduce new types of uncertainties into networked systems and impact control performance significantly. Due to typical packet loss, erasure channels create random link interruption and switching in network topologies. This paper models such switching network topologies by Markov chains and derives their probability transition matrices from stochastic characterizations of the channels. Impact of communication erasure channels on vehicle platoon formation and robustness under a weighted and constrained consensus framework is analyzed. By comparing convergence properties of networked control algorithms under different communication channel features, we characterize some intrinsic relationships between packet delivery ratio and convergence rate. Simulation case studies are performed to verify the theoretical findings.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2780113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8259379","startPage":"29","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8259379/08166785.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Communication Erasure Channels on Control Performance of Connected and Automated Vehicles","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8259379/8166785-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166785/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of Communication Erasure Channels on Control Performance of Connected and Automated Vehicles","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17506845","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-1-0131"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1054634"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Impact of Communication Erasure Channels on Control Performance of Connected and Automated Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2780113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108796S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8259379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8259379","articleId":"8166785","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8166790,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The nodes in the secondary network are assumed to be solely powered by ambient RF energy harvested from the transmissions of the primary network. We assume that the secondary nodes can eavesdrop on the primary transmissions due to which the primary network uses secrecy guard zones. The primary transmitter goes silent if any secondary receiver is detected within its guard zone. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of successful connection of the primary network as well as the probability of secure communication. Two conditions must be jointly satisfied in order to ensure successful connection: 1) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the primary receiver is above a predefined threshold, and 2) the primary transmitter is not silent. In order to ensure secure communication, the SINR value at each of the secondary nodes should be less than a predefined threshold. Clearly, when more secondary nodes are deployed, more primary transmitters will remain silent for a given guard zone radius, which will in turn impact the amount of energy harvested by the secondary network. Our results concretely show the existence of an optimal deployment density for the secondary network that maximizes the density of nodes that are able to harvest sufficient amount of energy. Furthermore, we show the dependence of this optimal deployment density on the guard zone radius of the primary network. In addition, we show that the optimal guard zone radius selected by the primary network is a function of the deployment density of the secondary network. This interesting coupling between the performance of the two networks is studied using tools from game theory. We propose an algorithm that can assist the two networks to converge to Nash equilibrium. The convergence of this algorithm is verified using simulations. Overall, this paper is one of the few concrete works that symbiotically merge tools from stochastic geometry and game theory.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2778703","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08166791.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2778703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistence of RF-powered IoT and a Primary Wireless Network With Secrecy Guard Zones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166791","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8309484/8166791-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coexistence of RF-powered IoT and a Primary Wireless Network With Secrecy Guard Zones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166791/","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8166791/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617695","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1464293"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Coexistence of RF-powered IoT and a Primary Wireless Network With Secrecy Guard Zones","sourcePdf":"twc-dhillon-2778703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12644S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8166791","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8166798,"authors":[{"name":"Nian-Ke Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Optoelectronics, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/8249911/8166798/chen-2779579-small.gif","p":["Nian-Ke Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Jilin\n University, Changchun, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

However, its switching mechanism is still unclear with intensive debates. In this work, by first-principles calculations and an electron counting model study, we study the possible mechanism of phase change and the accompanying property transition of GST-SL. GST-SL are separated into individual layers by van der Waals gaps. We demonstrate that both the global chemical stoichiometry of the material and the local chemical stoichiometry of individual layer block are required to have an insulating band gap according to an electron counting model analysis. The electrical property can be adjusted by changing the local stoichiometry, such as producing defects around van der Waals gaps. Inspired by a previous experiment, we propose that a stacking-fault motion can spontaneously alter the band gap and results in a metal-insulator transition. This transition may provide a significant change of carrier concentration and indicate an ultralow energy-consumption process with a low energy barrier. The present investigations reveal a picture of electrical transition in GST-SL and may guide us to improve its device performances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metal\u2013Insulator Transition of Ge\u2013Sb\u2013Te Superlattice: An Electron Counting Model Study","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2017.2779579","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8249911/08166798.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2017.2779579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Metal\u2013Insulator Transition of Ge\u2013Sb\u2013Te Superlattice: An Electron Counting Model Study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8166798/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17454609","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China and National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1104300, 61590930, 2014CB921303, 11374119, 61775077 and DE-SC0002623"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials (JLU)","grantNumber":"SKLSSM201723"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metal\u2013Insulator Transition of Ge\u2013Sb\u2013Te Superlattice: An Electron Counting Model Study","sourcePdf":"tnano-sun-2779579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081168S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8249911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8249911","articleId":"8166798","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8166802,"authors":[{"name":"Yusha Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8166802/liu-2778722-small.gif","p":["Yusha Liu received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Xiamen University, China, and the M.Sc. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, U.K., where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Southampton Wireless Group.

Hence, SM-SCDMA inherits both the merits of SM with single radio-frequency MIMO transceiver implementation and the advantages of SCDMA relying on low-complexity signal detection. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of SM-SCDMA as well as its low-complexity near-optimum signal detection. Given these objectives, we consider both the maximum likelihood detection and the message passing algorithm aided detection (MPAD) that is derived based on the maximum a posteriori principles. In order to evaluate the performance of large SM-SCDMA without relying on time-consuming simulations, we propose new approaches for analyzing the performance of SM-SCDMA systems. A range of formulas that are valid in the signal-to-noise ratio region of practical interest are derived. Finally, the performance of SM-SCDMA systems is investigated by addressing diverse design concerns. Our studies and performance results show that SM-SCDMA constitutes a promising MA scheme for the future ultra dense systems. Assisted by the MPAD, it is capable of supporting high-user-load MA transmission associated with a normalized user-load factor of two.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"17","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17617698","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8166802/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Modulation Aided Sparse Code-Division Multiple Access","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/P034284/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant Beam-Me-Up"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Modulation Aided Sparse Code-Division Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"twc-hanzo-2778722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148088S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8166802","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166804,"authors":[{"name":"Danyang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8288639/8166804/wang-2777488-small.gif","p":["Danyang Wang received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012.

The practical wireless systems, such as long-term evolution-advanced, usually operate at multiple transmission power levels, leading to a multiple primary transmission power scenario. In such a case, the two fundamental issues in hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum access are to detect the \u201cON/OFF\u201d status of PUs and to recognize the operating power level of PUs, which are challenging due to non-Gaussian transmitted signals. In this paper, we exploit high-order cumulants (HOCs) to efficiently perform spectrum sensing and power recognition. Specifically, for a given order and time lag, we first propose a single HOC-based spectrum sensing and power recognition scheme with low computational complexity, by leveraging minimum Bayes risk criterion. Moreover, we propose a hybrid multiple HOCs-based spectrum sensing and power recognition scheme with multiple orders and time lags, to further improve the detection performance.

However, SLSC imaging does not consider the content of images formed with different lags, and thus does not exploit the differences in tissue texture at each short-lag value. Our proposed method improves SLSC imaging by weighting the addition of lag values (i.e., M-weighting) and by applying robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to search for a low-dimensional subspace for projecting coherence images created with different lag values. The RPCA-based projections are considered to be denoised versions of the originals that are then weighted and added across lags to yield a final robust SLSC (R-SLSC) image. Our approach was tested on simulation, phantom, and in vivo liver data. Relative to DAS B-mode images, the mean contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) improvements with R-SLSC images are 21.22 dB, 2.54, and 2.36, respectively, when averaged over simulated, phantom, and in vivo data and over all lags considered, which corresponds to mean improvements of 96.4%, 121.2%, and 120.5%, respectively. When compared with SLSC images, the corresponding mean improvements with R-SLSC images were 7.38 dB, 1.52, and 1.30, respectively (i.e., mean improvements of 14.5%, 50.5%, and 43.2%, respectively). Results show great promise for smoothing out the tissue texture of SLSC images and enhancing anechoic or hypoechoic target visibility at higher lag values, which could be useful in clinical tasks such as breast cyst visualization, liver vessel tracking, and obese patient imaging.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/58/8306285/8166807-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","volume":"65","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17582405","pubMedId":"29505405","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8166807/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Short-Lag Spatial Coherence Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1443936 and CCF-1422995"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000098","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"R00 EB018994"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Robust Short-Lag Spatial Coherence Imaging","sourcePdf":"tuffc-nair-2780084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098526S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"8306285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8306285","articleId":"8166807","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8166808,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-4688-1451","id":"37085637421"},{"name":"Patrick P.

First, a capacity maximization problem is considered in half-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems with two accessible users on each subcarrier. Due to the intractability of the considered problem, we decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., the optimization of, respectively, sensing duration, user scheduling, and power allocation. By investigating and exploiting the characteristics of each subproblem, the optimal sensing duration adaptation, a matching-theory-based user scheduling, and the optimal power allocation are proposed correspondingly. An alternate iteration framework is further proposed to jointly optimize these three subproblems, with its convergence proved. Moreover, based on the non-cooperative game theory, a generalized power allocation algorithm is proposed and then used in the framework to accommodate half-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems with multiple users on each subcarrier. Finally, the proposed framework is extended to solve the capacity maximization problem in full-duplex cognitive OFDM-NOMA systems. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms. For example, for the case of two accessible users, the proposed framework approaches the optimal solution with less than 1% capacity loss and 120 times lower complexity compared with exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2777476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2777476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8288639/08166809.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Sensing Duration Adaptation, User Matching, and Power Allocation for Cognitive OFDM-NOMA Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8288639/8166809-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Sensing Duration Adaptation, User Matching, and Power Allocation for Cognitive OFDM-NOMA Systems","volume":"17","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8166809/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17561945","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166809/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471059 and 61362008"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-01"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar of China","grantNumber":"61525101"},{"fundingName":"Special Youth Science Foundation of Jiangxi","grantNumber":"20133ACB21007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"U.S. CNS-1343361, CNS-1350230 (CAREER), CNS-1646607 and CNS-1702850"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Joint Sensing Duration Adaptation, User Matching, and Power Allocation for Cognitive OFDM-NOMA Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2777476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139575S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8288639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8288639","articleId":"8166809","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8166813,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqi Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/9280471/8166813/xie-2780098-small.gif","p":["Guoqi Xie received the PhD degree in computer science and engineering from Hunan University, China, in 2014.

Primary-backup replication is an important software fault-tolerant technique used to satisfy reliability requirement. Recent works studied quantitative fault-tolerant scheduling to reduce execution cost by minimizing the number of replicas while satisfying the reliability requirement of a workflow on heterogeneous infrastructure as a service (IaaS) clouds. However, a minimum number of replicas does not necessarily lead to the minimum execution cost and shortest schedule length in a heterogeneous IaaS cloud. In this study, we propose the quantitative fault-tolerant scheduling algorithms QFEC and QFEC+ with minimum execution costs and QFSL and QFSL+ with shortest schedule lengths while satisfing the reliability requirements of workflows. Extensive experimental results show that (1) compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms achieve less execution cost and shorter schedule length, although the number of replicas are not minimum; (2) QFEC and QFEC+ are designed to reduce execution cost, and QFEC+ is better than QFEC for all low-parallelism and high-parallelism workflows; and (3) QFSL and QFSL+ are designed to decrease schedule length, and QFSL+ is better than QFSL for all low-parallelism and high-parallelism workflows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"IEEE Xplore Notice to Reader \"Quantitative Fault-tolerance for Reliable Workflows on Heterogeneous IaaS Clouds\" by Guoqi Xie, Gang Zeng, Renfa Li, and Keqin Li published in IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing Early Access Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/TCC.2017.2780098 This article includes an author who was prohibited from publishing with IEEE prior to publication of the article.

Due to the increasing use of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technique, a CAD system in retinal OCT is essential to assist ophthalmologist in the early detection of ocular diseases and treatment monitoring. This paper presents a novel CAD system based on a multi-scale convolutional mixture of expert (MCME) ensemble model to identify normal retina, and two common types of macular pathologies, namely, dry age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic macular edema. The proposed MCME modular model is a data-driven neural structure, which employs a new cost function for discriminative and fast learning of image features by applying convolutional neural networks on multiple-scale sub-images. MCME maximizes the likelihood function of the training data set and ground truth by considering a mixture model, which tries also to model the joint interaction between individual experts by using a correlated multivariate component for each expert module instead of only modeling the marginal distributions by independent Gaussian components. Two different macular OCT data sets from Heidelberg devices were considered for the evaluation of the method, i.e., a local data set of OCT images of 148 subjects and a public data set of 45 OCT acquisitions. For comparison purpose, we performed a wide range of classification measures to compare the results with the best configurations of the MCME method. With the MCME model of four scale-dependent experts, the precision rate of 98.86%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9985 were obtained on average.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macular OCT Classification Using a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2780115","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2780115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8329247/08166817.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Macular OCT Classification Using a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8166817/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17661151","pubMedId":"29610079","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003970","fundingName":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences","grantNumber":"395645"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macular OCT Classification Using a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble","sourcePdf":"tmi-rabbani-2780115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109743S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8329247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8329247","articleId":"8166817","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8166827,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Pfeifer","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Pfeifer"},{"name":"Heinrich Theodor Vierhaus","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Heinrich Theodor","lastName":"Vierhaus"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-30-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1844-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"}],"articleNumber":"8166827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Service robots","Computer architecture","Wireless communication","Manufacturing","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","business communication","channel coding","error correction codes","forward error correction","Hamming codes","parity check codes","Reed-Solomon codes","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","wireless communication systems","industrial applications","industrial manufacturing","moving rotating arms","bending rotating arms","multiple joints","communication channels","industrial environments","standard industrial communication networks","rigid time frames","multiple path propagation","BCH codes","Reed-Solomon codes","turbo codes","single effort correction","double error detection","SEC-DED-codes","Hamming code","Hsiao code","multiple bit errors","multiple error detection","adaptive error correction","industrial communication systems","robots","programmable encoding architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166827","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119307/8166822/08166827.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2017.8166827","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166822","publicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward error correction in wireless communication systems for industrial applications","abstract":"Industrial manufacturing is more and more based groups of robots in production cells. The robots consist of moving, bending and rotating arms with multiple joints. Cables that connect sections of robots undergo heavy stress from stretching and twisting, resulting in wear-out and failure. Replacing cables on robots by wireless communication therefore is an alternative that has been investigated for some time. Unfortunately, communication channels in industrial environments suffer from some adversary effect. First, standard industrial communication networks work on rigid time frames which limit allowed latencies in communication systems considerably. Second, multiple path propagation and destructive interferences make such communication channels sensitive to fading problems. Therefore forward error correction (FEC) that can compensate massive variations of signal strength becomes a must. On the other hand, forward error correction using known methods such as BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes, turbo codes and low-density parity checks (LDPC) is not very fast by nature. Codes for single effort correction and double error detection (SEC-DED-codes) such as Hamming code and Hsiao code are fast, but they are not powerful enough to correct multiple bit errors or restore missing symbols, unless they are applied in a step-wise approximation. PENCA (programmable encoding architecture) is a new approach in multiple error detection and correction which is, at present based on BCH codes, reasonably fast by parallel hardware. Furthermore, it allows for adaptive error correction, based on the quality of the channel, therefore providing a better overhead / performance ratio than methods that are based on a fixed number of allowed error bits in a symbol, tailored to handle worst-case conditions. PENCA is currently becoming part of an industrial communication systems developed in the ParSeC project, which is a cooperative effort of industries, universities and research institutes, funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166827/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17415360","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Forward error correction in wireless communication systems for industrial applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward error correction in wireless communication systems for industrial applications","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061815S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isNumber":"8166822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119307","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8166827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-10"},{"_id":8166840,"authors":[{"name":"Marzena Mi\u0119sikowska","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechatronics and Machine Engineering, Kielce University of Technology, Kielce, Poland"],"firstName":"Marzena","lastName":"Mi\u0119sikowska","id":"37086295768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-30-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1844-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"}],"articleNumber":"8166840","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Acoustics","Time-frequency analysis","Aircraft","Propellers","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","autonomous aerial vehicles","object detection","propellers","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X8 unmanned aerial vehicle","recorded acoustic signal","UAV","different altitudes","time-frequency analysis","discriminant function analysis","sound levels","signal analysis","rotating propellers","object detection","MFCC","noise figure 12.4 dB","noise figure 70.4 dB","noise figure 58.0 dB","distance 10.0 m to 50.0 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","signal frequency analysis","sound levels","detection of unmanned aerial vehicles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166840","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166840","publicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","abstract":"The aim of the present study was frequency analysis of the recorded acoustic signal of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with 8 rotating propellers conducting sound level, time-frequency and discriminant function analyses.

This information may prove important in applications for object detection. Recordings were acquired when the UAV was hovering at 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m, and 50m. Results showed that the sound level A when the UAV was hovering at 50m was 58 dB(A), and 70.4 dB(A) at 10m. The sound level decreased around 12.4 dB(A) with the increasing height position of the UAV from 10m to 50m. A fourfold increase of the height position caused a 12.4 dB(A) decrease in the sound level. Time-frequency analysis showed characteristic bands for the UAV hovering at different altitudes up to 1 kHz and around 8 kHz.

As the feature size of the semiconductor technology shrinks, also FPGA-based systems using underlying nano-technologies suffer from age-induced parameter deterioration that may finally result in permanent faults. Hence, the mechanisms embedding into such systems for detecting and handling such faults in the field of operation is an essential requirement for increasing the reliability. This paper presents different approaches in handling the permanent faults in FPGA-based soft processors at a coarse and fine granularity. Self-repair methods are implemented through utilizing spare units as a substitute of corrupted units in the design and a partial reconfiguration technique. The method aims at using local fault handling methods to make use of extra resources in the system with the lowest overhead in time and area. The results were achieved by using Xilinx 28 nm technology and two soft processors.","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166849","publicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119307/8166822/08166849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2017.8166849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166822","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The coarse and fine granular fault tolerance techniques in FPGA-based processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The coarse and fine granular fault tolerance techniques in FPGA-based processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166849/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415382","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The coarse and fine granular fault tolerance techniques in FPGA-based processors","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073368S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119307","isNumber":"8166822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119307","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8166822","articleId":"8166849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8166863,"authors":[{"name":"Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, HK"],"firstName":"Yasar Abbas","lastName":"Ur Rehman","id":"37085794189"},{"name":"Lai Man Po","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, HK"],"firstName":"Lai Man","lastName":"Po","id":"37270836200"},{"name":"Mengyang Liu","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Mengyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086299859"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-30-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1844-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"}],"articleNumber":"8166863","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1042},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Computer architecture","Training data","Databases","Support vector machines","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","computer vision","convolution","face recognition","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face anti-spoofing algorithms","face biometrics","end-to-end CNN architecture","50 Random Samples-30 Sub-epochs Count-1Epoch","deep learning","convolution neural networks","50RS-30SeC-1E training strategy","11-layer VGG network","CASIA-FASD dataset","biometric authentication systems","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"The importance of face anti-spoofing algorithms in biometric authentication systems is becoming indispensable. Recently, the success of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) in key application areas of computer vision has encouraged its use in face biometrics for face anti-spoofing and verification applications. However, small training data has restricted the use of deep CNN architectures for face anti-spoofing applications. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end CNN architecture for face anti-spoofing application. i.e. a deep CNN architecture which directly map the raw input face images to the corresponding output classes. Additionally, an efficient training strategy has been proposed to enable the use of deeper CNN structures for face anti-spoofing applications and to enable the growth of training data in autonomous way. For training a CNN architecture, we propose a 50RS-30SeC-1E (50 Random Samples-30 Sub-epochs Count-1Epoch) training strategy. The training data is randomly sampled during each forward-pass through the CNN architecture and 30 such passes counts for 1 complete epoch. An 11-layer VGG network with 2 derived VGG-11 networks have been trained for face anti-spoofing on CASIA-FASD dataset. Experimental results show significant improvement on various face-spoofing scenarios.

It is crucial to develop efficient and robust algorithms that would allow real time operation in a wide range of environments. This paper presents an efficient adaptive algorithm of stereo matching that was applied and optimized for the mobile Graphics Processing Unit. It is a well known problem that most of the stereo vision algorithms are based on the dense stereo matching methods that in most of the cases are the main factor for a demanding computation cost. The presented method introduces a novel approach to the stereo matching problem by adaptively combining the cost function that can be computed efficiently for small matching window and sparse accumulated windows similar to those applied in convolutional neural networks. Adaptability of this method is based on detecting edges in the processed images. Such a solution allows obtaining precise subpixel results on highly textured regions of the image as well as to obtain stable results on weakly matchable texture-less regions while sustaining high efficiency and not causing problems related to the memory bandwidth bottleneck.","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166864","publicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119307/8166822/08166864.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2017.8166864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive edge-based stereo block matching algorithm for a mobile Graphics Processing Unit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166864/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive edge-based stereo block matching algorithm for a mobile Graphics Processing Unit","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415362","htmlLink":"/document/8166864/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive edge-based stereo block matching algorithm for a mobile Graphics Processing Unit","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052215S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119307","isNumber":"8166822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119307","xplore-issue":"8166822","articleId":"8166864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8166887,"authors":[{"name":"Iwona Kochanska","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Iwona","lastName":"Kochanska","id":"37085884013"},{"name":"Jan Schmidt","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37085894304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-30-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1844-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"}],"articleNumber":"8166887","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166887","abstract":"Underwater acoustic communication channels are characterized by a large variety of propagation conditions.

It is essential in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Advanced Video Surveillance Systems (AVSS). The most widely used method involves a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It offers quite high detection accuracy at the cost of high computational complexity. Therefore, it is impossible to use GPP-based (General Purpose Processor) embedded systems for this application. In this paper a hardware-software HOG+SVM pedestrian detection system implemented in a heterogeneous Xilinx Zynq device is presented. The base algorithm is supported with detection grouping and tracking procedures. They increase the performance of the solution, especially in case of temporal partially occluded or vague visible objects. The system is able to process a 1280 \u00d7 720 @ 60 fps video stream in real-time.","doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166901","publicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119307/8166822/08166901.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPA.2017.8166901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded vision system for pedestrian detection based on HOG+SVM and use of motion information implemented in Zynq heterogeneous device","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166901/","displayDocTitle":"Embedded vision system for pedestrian detection based on HOG+SVM and use of motion information implemented in Zynq heterogeneous device","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415344","htmlLink":"/document/8166901/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded vision system for pedestrian detection based on HOG+SVM and use of motion information implemented in Zynq heterogeneous device","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051681S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119307","isNumber":"8166822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119307","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8166822","articleId":"8166901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8166916,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Sobotta","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Sobotta","id":"37074113900"},{"name":"Robert Wolf","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wolf","id":"38267403700"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Computational NeuroEngineering Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger","id":"37275628500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3175-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3176-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-0446"}],"articleNumber":"8166916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166916","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Impedance","Geometry","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Load modeling","Windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autotransformers","BiCMOS integrated circuits","driver circuits","Ge-Si alloys","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["totem-pole driver","optimization method","optimum load line","structural analysis","SiGe BiCMOS technology","auto-transformer-based power amplifier","chip-on-board mounted","DVB-T signals","error vector magnitude requirements","size 0.25 mum","bandwidth 800.0 MHz","bandwidth 650.0 MHz","efficiency 38 percent","efficiency 19 percent","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power amplifier (PA)","transformer","auto-transformer","load line","SiGe BiCMOS","digital video broadcasting \u2014 terrestrial (DVB-T)","totem-pole driver"]}],"abstract":"We present a fully integrated auto-transformer-based power amplifier with totem-pole driver exhibiting a very high bandwidth.

The path planner module is a key element of any autonomous UAV. It computes the optimal path from a start point to an end point. In this paper, we present a parallel genetic algorithm for UAV path planning using an embedded NVIDIA Jetson TX1 single-board computer. The path is built as a series of line segment connected by circular arcs to remove discontinuities and to account for the dynamics of fixed wing UAVs. It is optimized to minimize the average altitude avoiding detection by enemy radars and to minimize fuel consumption improving range. The software developed is tested on four different 3D terrains. By exploiting the parallel architecture of the Jetson TX1 GPU, the proposed path planner provides a speedup of 33x compared to a sequential execution on an ARM processor. It calculates quasi-optimal solutions in complex 3D environments in less than 4 seconds and requires only 10 Watts, making it an excellent solution for onboard path planning.","doi":"10.1109/SSD.2017.8166929","publicationTitle":"2017 14th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 14th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119308/8166904/08166929.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSD.2017.8166929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8166904","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast path planning for unmanned aerial vehicle using embedded GPU System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8166929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast path planning for unmanned aerial vehicle using embedded GPU System","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8166929/","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17415497","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8166929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast path planning for unmanned aerial vehicle using embedded GPU System","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1570329477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08636S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119308","isNumber":"8166904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119308","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8166904","articleId":"8166929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8166997,"authors":[{"name":"Rim Ben Ammar","affiliation":["Dept.

They were trained based on past data from the National Institute of Meteorology adopting a standard back propagation algorithm. After training, the test of the different networks and the comparison between the predicted and the measured powers showed that the average error between them doesn't exceed 8%.

Using Memristors as the main storage element provides the potential of achieving higher density and more efficient solutions than conventional methods.

In this paper, we present a hardware MTCAM emulation based on 2-Transistors-2Memristors (2T2M) bit-cell.

The higher the interference, the smaller the capacity is. One of the methods to minimize the interference is cluster formation in the CDMA Wireless Sensor Network. Using cluster, the interference can be minimized because transmission power to send data decreases as the sensor only transmits data to Cluster Head (CH), not directly to sink. There are two types of the interference on the CDMA Wireless Sensor Network, namely: intra-cluster interference (Multiple Acces Interference/MAI) and inter-cluster interference (Node Interference/NI). The intra-cluster interference is overcome by using power control so that the received power in the Cluster Head from every sensor is the same. However, the Cluster Head is not able to control sensor's transmission power from other clusters, so interference from other cluster cannot be managed. The research analyzes the factors influencing inter-cluster interference comprising of distance between clusters, cluster size, influence of sensors located near cluster's border and the network capacity. The research shows distance and position of sensors will impact to inteference. If the distance between clusters rises 1.5 times, then it will reduce the power of interference signal by 8.6 dB. And the sensors at the border generate higher interference than other sensors. This problem is overcome by using layering technique, in that high power sensors at the border will send data through intermediary sensor. As a result this methode can reduce transmission power of the sensors at the border. Therefore, applying layering technique is capable of reducing interference of the sensors at the border. The research shows that if the layering radius is 0.7 of cluster size, it will generate minimum inter-cluster interference. Finally utilizing the cluster formation will increase the network capacity. If the network applies the unequal number of sensors in the cluster, it will increase 3% capacity compared to the equal number of sensors in the cluster.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Applied Computer and Communication Technologies (ComCom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8116544/8167074/08167080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Applied Computer and Communication Technologies (ComCom)","doi":"10.1109/COMCOM.2017.8167080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCOM.2017.8167080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of optimal capacity in cluster of CDMA Wireless Sensor Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Wireless sensor networks","Mathematical model","Multiaccess communication","Network topology","Capacitive sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra-cluster interference","Cluster Head","transmission power","high power sensors","intermediary sensor","minimum inter-cluster interference","cluster formation","CDMA Wireless Sensor Network","active sensors","Multiple Acces Interference","Node Interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor","capacity","CDMA","interference","cluster"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of optimal capacity in cluster of CDMA Wireless Sensor Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167080/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17415322","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"17-18 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of optimal capacity in cluster of CDMA Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Jakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"2017001TS01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048301S","chronDate":"17-18 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8116544","isNumber":"8167074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8116544","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167074","articleId":"8167080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167115,"authors":[{"name":"Bayu Adhi Tama","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence and Applications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bayu Adhi","lastName":"Tama","id":"37085365587"},{"name":"Bruno Joachim Kweka","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence and Applications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bruno Joachim","lastName":"Kweka","id":"37086321329"},{"name":"Youngho Park","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence and Applications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngho","lastName":"Park","id":"37086322032"},{"name":"Kyung-Hyune Rhee","affiliation":["Department of IT Convergence and Applications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Hyune","lastName":"Rhee","id":"37282633700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7675-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7674-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7676-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167115","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4718},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Medical services","Bitcoin","Industries","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","electronic money","financial data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain technology","digital currency platform","cryptocurrencies","money","payments","Bitcoin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blockchain","cryptocurrency","review","applications"]}],"abstract":"Blockchain technology has been known as a digital currency platform since the emergence of Bitcoin, the first and the largest of the cryptocurrencies.

Firstly, aiming to solve the problems that PSO has low searching speed and PSO is easy to fall into local optimal solution especially when dealing with high-dimension model, this paper modifies the PSO from the point of inertia weight improvements. The three improved inertia weights separately update the searching speed of particles with different principles, which are called linear-decline inertial weight, stochastic inertial weight and adaptive inertia weight. Then, three problems of evaluation non-linear function extremum are adopted in the simulation part to verify the convergence speed and optimization ability of three modified PSO algorithms. The numerical analyses demonstrate that these three improved inertia weights can guide particles to find the optimal solution more precisely and quickly. Thus, three proposed inertia-weight-improvement-based PSO algorithms have certain significance.","doi":"10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167198","startPage":"150","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167044","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8115600/8167044/08167198.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical analyses of three inertia-weight-improvement-based particle swarm optimization algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167198/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Numerical analyses of three inertia-weight-improvement-based particle swarm optimization algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167198/","accessionNumber":"17415282","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical analyses of three inertia-weight-improvement-based particle swarm optimization algorithms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICCIA034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048026S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8115600","isNumber":"8167044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8115600","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167044","articleId":"8167198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8167199,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Kang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086308746"},{"name":"Zhiyi Qu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyi","lastName":"Qu","id":"37401755700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2030-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-2029-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2031-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167199","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167199","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Air quality","Simulated annealing","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution","air quality","backpropagation","environmental monitoring (geophysics)","environmental science computing","genetic algorithms","neural nets","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network","air quality index","Lanzhou","air pollution","dimensionless index","AQI prediction model","back propagation neural network","genetic simulated annealing algorithm optimization","air quality forecasting","China air quality online monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Key","words","air quality index","optimization BP neural network","genetic algorithm","simulated annealing algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167199","pdfPath":"/iel7/8115600/8167044/08167199.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of BP neural network optimized by genetic simulated annealing algorithm to prediction of air quality index in Lanzhou","abstract":"It is of great significance to carry out cities' air quality forecasting work for the prevention of the air pollution in urban areas and to the improvement of the living environment of urban residents.

Nevertheless, non-factoid questions are equally important because they are common in community question answer (CQA). In this paper, we propose a semantic calculation based convolutional neural network (SCCNN) to address this problem. The main difference of SCCNN from previous models is the use of correlation information between question and answer (QA) sentences. This method calculates correlation features for all the words in sentences based on the similarity between a question and its corresponding answer. It will also be the direct input of the convolutional neural network. These information represents correlation degrees of all the tokens and allows for focusing on the important part of QA sentences. Experimental results show that our algorithm performs better than previous methods. In addition, we compare methods modeling Chinese words and characters individually, which indicates that for CNN-based methods, modeling the single character usually have better performance.","doi":"10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167221","pdfPath":"/iel7/8115600/8167044/08167221.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"274","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A convolutional neural network model for non-factoid Chinese answer selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A convolutional neural network model for non-factoid Chinese answer selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415234","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167221/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A convolutional neural network model for non-factoid Chinese answer selection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICCIA057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043935S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8115600","isNumber":"8167044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8115600","xplore-issue":"8167044","articleId":"8167221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8167234,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Mengqiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Fiber Optic Sensing Technology and Information Processing Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Mengqiao","id":"37086298049"},{"name":"Yang Jie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Fiber Optic Sensing Technology and Information Processing Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Jie","id":"37086300077"},{"name":"Chen Yilei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Fiber Optic Sensing Technology and Information Processing Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yilei","id":"37086897784"},{"name":"Wang Hao","affiliation":["Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Hao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2030-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-2029-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2031-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167234","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Image segmentation","Training","Sensitivity","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","convolution","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","medical image processing","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online evaluation platform","multimodal brain tumor image segmentation","convolutional neural networks","automatic brain tumor segmentation algorithm","gliomas segmentation","bias field distortion","MRI images","N4ITK method","intensity normalization","cascaded convolution layers","batch normalization technique","BRATS 2015 databases","positive predictive value matric","three-dimensional convolutional neural network","time 140.0 min"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain tumor segmentation","convolutional neural Network","intensity normalization","evaluation matrics"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an automatic brain tumor segmentation algorithm based on a 22-layers deep, three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the challenging problem of gliomas segmentation.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can get good PAPR reduction and has a low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167258","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8115600/8167044/08167258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIAPP.2017.8167258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167044","startPage":"449","endPage":"453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial bee colony-based SLM scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An artificial bee colony-based SLM scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167258/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415259","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial bee colony-based SLM scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICCIA094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067199S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8115600","isNumber":"8167044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8115600","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8167044","articleId":"8167258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167270,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Yuzhe","affiliation":["Department of civil device research China Electronics Technology, Group Corporation 12th Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Yuzhe","id":"37086321128"},{"name":"Yang Jinsheng","affiliation":["Department of civil device research China Electronics Technology, Group Corporation 12th Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Jinsheng","id":"37939207100"},{"name":"Liu Yongtao","affiliation":["Department of civil device research China Electronics Technology, Group Corporation 12th Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Yongtao","id":"37086321725"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2030-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-2029-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2031-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167270","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Acceleration","Sociology","Statistics","Impedance","Cavity resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerator RF systems","genetic algorithms","mathematics computing","optimisation","particle beam dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-band standing wave accelerator","genetic algorithm","automatic cavities structure optimized","method accelerated structure","electromagnetic stimulation software CST","multiparameter structure","optimization process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","accelerator","automatic optimization","MATLAB","CST"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167270","abstract":"Aiming at the problem of optimizing the structural of X-band standing wave accelerator with multi-parameter, a method for automatic cavities structure optimized and based on genetic algorithm was proposed in this paper.

The double-diode electrical model of solar PV is known to be more accurate than its single diode model counterpart since it takes into account the effect of recombination. However, because of its nonlinear characteristics, the parameters of the double-diode model (DDM) have to be identified using optimization algorithms. In this paper, the wind-driven optimization (WDO) algorithm is proposed as a potential new method for identifying the parameters of a 12-parameter DDM of the solar PV. The accuracy and flexibility of the proposed method are verified using three different sets of data: first, experimental data at the controlled environmental condition; second, data sheet values of different solar PV modules; and third, real-time experimental data at the uncontrolled environmental condition. Additionally, the performance of the WDO is compared with other well-known existing optimization techniques. The obtained results show that the WDO algorithm can provide optimized values with reduced mean absolute error in power and reduced root mean square error for different types of solar PV modules at different environmental conditions. We show that the WDO can be confidently recommended as a reliable optimization algorithm for parameter estimation of solar PV model.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.2769000","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503869/8232488/08167303.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.2769000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","startPage":"248","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind-Driven Optimization Technique for Estimation of Solar Photovoltaic Parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wind-Driven Optimization Technique for Estimation of Solar Photovoltaic Parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167303/","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8167303/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466979","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind-Driven Optimization Technique for Estimation of Solar Photovoltaic Parameters","sourcePdf":"jphotov-chinnappa-2769000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072125S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503869","isNumber":"8232488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503869","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8232488","articleId":"8167303","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8167305,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Raspopoulos","affiliation":["Center of INterdisciplinary Science Promotion & Innovative Research Exploration, Larnaca, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/8246665/8167305/raspo-2774181-small.gif","p":["Marios Raspopoulos received the M.Eng. degree in electronics and mobile communications, the M.Sc. degree in communications networks and software, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K., in 2003, 2004, and 2008, respectively.","From 2004 to 2008, he was a Researcher with the Center for Communications and Systems Research, University of Surrey.

Device heterogeneity constitutes a limitation in fingerprint-based approaches and also constructing radiomaps through extensive in situ measurement campaigns is laborious and time-consuming even with a single device let alone the need for radiomaps constructed using multiple different devices. This paper tackles both challenges through the use of 3-D RT for radiomap generation in conjunction with data calibration using a small set of device-specific measurements to make the radiomap device independent. The efficiency of this approach is evaluated using simulations and measurements in terms of the time spent to generate the radiomap, the amount of device-specific data required for calibration, and in terms of the achievable positioning accuracy. Potential accuracy improvements in the RT-based indoor positioning process are further investigated, by studying the use of map constraints into the algorithm in the form of a priori probabilities. In this approach, a route probability factor (RPF), which reflects the likelihood of a user being in various locations inside the environment is used. The outcome of the evaluation process, which includes a study of different RPF distributions, indicates the validity of the approach, demonstrated by a reduction in the positioning error for various devices. The versatility of this approach is also demonstrated for different scenarios, different devices, and by considering different device-handling conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2017.2774181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/8246665/08167305.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2017.2774181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidevice Map-Constrained Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning Using 3-D Ray Tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167305/","displayDocTitle":"Multidevice Map-Constrained Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning Using 3-D Ray Tracing","volume":"67","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17520066","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167305/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidevice Map-Constrained Fingerprint-Based Indoor Positioning Using 3-D Ray Tracing","sourcePdf":"tim-raspopoulos-2774181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09667S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"8246665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8246665","articleId":"8167305","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8167311,"authors":[{"name":"Xian-Ming Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8330726/8167311/zhang-2776283-small.gif","p":["Xian-Ming Zhang (M\u201918) received the M.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 1992 and 2006, respectively.","In 1992, he joined Central South University, where he was an Associate Professor with the School of Mathematics and Statistics.

Notice that a Bessel-Legendre inequality plays a key role in deriving less conservative stability criteria for delayed neural networks. However, this inequality is in the form of Legendre polynomials and the integral interval is fixed on [-h, 0]. As a result, the application scope of the Bessel-Legendre inequality is limited. This paper aims to develop the Bessel-Legendre inequality method so that less conservative stability criteria are expected. First, by introducing a canonical orthogonal polynomial sequel, a canonical Bessel-Legendre inequality and its affine version are established, which are not explicitly in the form of Legendre polynomials. Moreover, the integral interval is shifted to a general one [a, b]. Second, by introducing a proper augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which is tailored for the canonical Bessel-Legendre inequality, some sufficient conditions on global asymptotic stability are formulated for neural networks with constant delays and neural networks with time-varying delays, respectively. These conditions are proven to have a hierarchical feature: the higher level of hierarchy, the less conservatism of the stability criterion. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed stability criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2776283","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8330726/08167311.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2776283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Type Stability Criteria for Delayed Neural Networks via Canonical Bessel\u2013Legendre Inequalities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Delays","Asymptotic stability","Biological neural networks","Upper bound","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delay systems","Legendre polynomials","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","stability criteria","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical type stability criteria","delayed neural networks","global asymptotic stability","Legendre polynomials","integral interval","canonical orthogonal polynomial sequel","canonical Bessel-Legendre inequality","time-varying delays","augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bessel\u2013Legendre inequality","delayed neural networks","global asymptotic stability","hierarchy","Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional (LKF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Type Stability Criteria for Delayed Neural Networks via Canonical Bessel\u2013Legendre Inequalities","volume":"48","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8167311/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17669823","pubMedId":"29621005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP160103567"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Type Stability Criteria for Delayed Neural Networks via Canonical Bessel\u2013Legendre Inequalities","sourcePdf":"tcyb-han-2776283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198676S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8330726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8330726","articleId":"8167311","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8167317,"authors":[{"name":"Ruocheng Wang","affiliation":["Peking University Information Technology Institute (Tianjin Binhai), Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8293879/8167317/wang-2771801-small.gif","p":["Ruocheng Wang was born in Nanjing, China, in 1995.

Regardless of the compliance element (1R-1R or 1T-1R), some degree of current overshoot is unavoidable. The peak value of the overshoot current is often used as a predictive metric of the filament characteristics and is linked to the parasitic capacitance of the test structure. The reported detrimental effects of higher parasitic capacitance seem to support this concept. However, this understanding is inconsistent with the recent successes of compliance-free ultrashort pulse forming which guarantees a maximum peak overshoot current. We use detailed circuit analysis and experimental measurements of 1R-1R and 1T-1R structures to show that the peak overshoot is independent of the parasitic capacitance while the overshoot duration is strongly dependent on the parasitic capacitance. Forming control can be achieved, in ultrashort pulse forming, since the overshoot duration is always less than the applied pulse duration. The demonstrated success of ultrashort pulse forming becomes easier to reconcile after identifying the importance of overshoot duration.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2776860","startPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8232422/08167320.pdf","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2776860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167320/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Control of RRAM Overshoot Current","volume":"65","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167320/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17481806","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Control of RRAM Overshoot Current","sourcePdf":"ted-shrestha-2776860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070715S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8232422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8232422","articleId":"8167320","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167322,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Queiroz Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Statistics, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Rafael Queiroz Gon\u00e7alves received the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Federal University of Santa Catarina.

This approach covers the ten PM knowledge areas, guiding students through the planning of software projects. Background: Because software PM is unfeasible without the support of a PM tool there is a growing demand that these tools be taught in the higher education computer courses. Hence, several approaches already have been proposed to improve this teaching, such as educational PM tools or simulators, which facilitate the application of specific PM techniques and the treatment of their results. Another approach to improve the teaching of PM tools is instructional feedback, but little information is as yet available on how to provide instructional feedback when teaching software PM. Intended Outcomes: Instructional feedback, essential to helping students to learn, is based on an evaluation of their actions and decisions. To take advantage of this instructional approach, this paper proposes an instructional feedback technique to be employed in an instructional unit (IU) teaching PM tools aligned with the project management body of knowledge. Application Design: This technique was evaluated through an experiment carried out in undergraduate computer courses. Control and experiential groups were exposed to the same IU, with only the experiential group using the instructional feedback technique. Findings: The proposed feedback technique contributes to student learning, meeting students' need for better explanations to acquire a comprehensive understanding of PM theory and its practice.","doi":"10.1109/TE.2017.2774766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2017.2774766","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel7/13/8353738/08167322.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8353738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Instructional Feedback Technique for Teaching Project Management Tools Aligned With PMBOK","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Instructional Feedback Technique for Teaching Project Management Tools Aligned With PMBOK","volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17736655","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8167322/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Instructional Feedback Technique for Teaching Project Management Tools Aligned With PMBOK","sourcePdf":"te-goncalves-2774766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080881S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"8353738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","xplore-issue":"8353738","articleId":"8167322","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167326,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Ran","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8262688/8167326/ran-2771503-small.gif","p":["Lei Ran was born in Shandong, China, in 1989.

Fast factorized backprojection (FFBP) is considered as an ideal methodology for highresolution and high-squint SAR imagery. However, FFBP performs pixel-by-pixel interpolation, yielding heavy computational burden and limiting its real-time processing. In this paper, target detection technique, which is used as a discrimination tool to retain the target pixels and reject the clutter and noise pixels, is integrated into the subaperture imaging chain during FFBP implementation, aiming to speed up the overall image formation time. Due to the characteristic of spotlight acquisition, an adaptive processing scheme is developed for multiple subaperture images detection. With the integrated target detection technique, only the target pixels need to be interpolated and accumulated coherently. Without loss of focusing performance, the number of interpolations is dramatically reduced. The proposed fast imaging algorithm is named as adaptive FFBP (AFFBP), and it has distinctive superiority for sparse scene reconstruction, such as the maritime target imaging. AFFBP has been successfully applied to two simulated scenes with high and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and two real measured datasets with squint angle high up to 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, respectively. All these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency improvement of the proposed AFFBP algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2771503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8262688/08167326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2771503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8262688","startPage":"171","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Fast Factorized Back-Projection Algorithm With Integrated Target Detection Technique for High-Resolution and High-Squint Spotlight SAR Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Fast Factorized Back-Projection Algorithm With Integrated Target Detection Technique for High-Resolution and High-Squint Spotlight SAR Imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17535025","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8167326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301282"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Fast Factorized Back-Projection Algorithm With Integrated Target Detection Technique for High-Resolution and High-Squint Spotlight SAR Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-ran-2771503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083678S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8262688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8262688","articleId":"8167326","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8167389,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-68303-102-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167389","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4075},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"32NF - Technology Committee on Network and Facilities Infrastructure"}],"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compression","Identification","Metadata"]}],"abstract":"This standard specifies the real-time, RTP-based transport of uncompressed active video essence over IP networks.

However, RTL models are becoming more and more complex, making difficult the identification of malicious behaviours also at this level. Unfortunately, only a few verification techniques have been proposed for the identification of HTs in RTL descriptions. To fill in the gap, this paper proposes a technique that exploits graph-based features and a probabilistic neural network to identify and classify HTs at RTL. The approach identifies suspicious locations inside the RTL description according to a set of known HTs.

In this work, we present the digital signal-processing unit. The system performs the acquisition of the needed bio-signal, from 4 wireless surface EMG electrodes. The acquired data undergo to a dynamic bit-stream description of the signals. The latter ones are analyzed by a fast and accurate algorithm performing the comparison of signals derived by two EMG electrodes suitably positioned on the same muscle. The entire computation system fully operates in real-time on the Altera Cyclone V FPGA. The myoelectric signals have been recorded by 2 left and 2 right electrodes placed on the Left and Right Gastrocnemius of a subject involved in 1250 dynamic contractions. The in vivo measurements show that under the same experimental conditions, in 5 days, the system reveals a MCV mean value of 7.62\u00b10.35 m/s demonstrating a good repeatability (reliability) of the measurements in long-time estimation application. In a real-time application, one step - one MCV, the tool typically shows the 98% (Best: 100%, Worst: 88%) of probability to provide the right MCV values, comparing it with the clinical literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International High Level Design Validation and Test Workshop (HLDVT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119415/8167450/08167467.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International High Level Design Validation and Test Workshop (HLDVT)","doi":"10.1109/HLDVT.2017.8167467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HLDVT.2017.8167467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of FPGA-based muscle conduction velocity tracker in dynamic contractions during the gait","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Electromyography","Muscles","Estimation","Shift registers","Reliability","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","electromyography","field programmable gate arrays","gait analysis","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acquired data","dynamic bit-stream description","fast algorithm","accurate algorithm","Altera Cyclone V FPGA","myoelectric signals","long-time estimation application","real-time application","muscle conduction velocity tracker","novel FPGA","ordinary dynamic contractions","digital signal-processing unit","bio-signal","computation system","dynamic contractions","gait analysis","wireless surface EMG electrodes","clinical literature","MCV mean value","velocity 7.2700000000000005 m/s to 7.97 m/s","time 5.0 d"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromyography","MFCV","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of FPGA-based muscle conduction velocity tracker in dynamic contractions during the gait","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167467/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17398121","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of FPGA-based muscle conduction velocity tracker in dynamic contractions during the gait","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069664S","chronDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119415","isNumber":"8167450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119415","xplore-issue":"8167450","articleId":"8167467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167469,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Fujita","affiliation":["Tokyo Daigaku, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37086310099"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3997-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3998-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-7827"}],"articleNumber":"8167469","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167469","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Benchmark testing","Logic circuits","Circuit faults","Approximate computing","Debugging","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","logic circuits","logic design","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate computing","logic transformations","one-minterm changes","multilevel logic circuit implementation","truth table value","approximate logic synthesis","functional changes","input signals","topological changes","logic debugging","immediate fanins","engineering change order"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HLDVT.2017.8167469","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International High Level Design Validation and Test Workshop (HLDVT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International High Level Design Validation and Test Workshop (HLDVT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119415/8167450/08167469.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HLDVT.2017.8167469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to approximate computing: Logic transformations for one-minterm changes in specification","abstract":"Here we consider one special situation for approximate computing. Given a specification, S, in a truth table and its corresponding multi-level logic circuit implementation, I, S is changed to S' by only changing the truth table value for exactly one minterm from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. We would like to transform I into I' in such a way that I' is equivalent to S' This is a sort of basic operations for approximate logic synthesis, as the functional changes are minimal (only for one minterm). We experimentally show that even if we change functions for all of the gates in the circuit, I, without changing their input signals (their immediate fanins), i.e., no topological changes, the circuit can never become equivalent to S' for all the cases we tried. However, if we allow to change the function of only one gate in the last level of the circuit, I, and allow to change its input signals as well, the circuit becomes equivalent to S' around 13% of the cases in average with in average additional 1.1 inputs to the gate in the last level. We also experimentally show that one minterm changes in truth tables are, comparing with one and two products changes where all minterms inside the products are changed, the most difficult problems to accommodate from the viewpoint of Engineering Change Order (ECO) or logic debugging, when the circuits are implemented as multi-level logic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167469/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415624","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An approach to approximate computing: Logic transformations for one-minterm changes in specification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to approximate computing: Logic transformations for one-minterm changes in specification","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"wip2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068722S","chronDate":"5-6 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119415","isNumber":"8167450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119415","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167450","articleId":"8167469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167555,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Rifi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Azm Center for Researches, Tripoli, Lebanon","COSMO, University of Evry, France"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Rifi","id":"37086269002"},{"name":"Elie Rachkidi","affiliation":["COSMO, University of Evry, France"],"firstName":"Elie","lastName":"Rachkidi","id":"37085419747"},{"name":"Nazim Agoulmine","affiliation":["COSMO, University of Evry, France"],"firstName":"Nazim","lastName":"Agoulmine","id":"37279949700"},{"name":"Nada Chendeb Taher","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Azm Center for Researches, Tripoli, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Nada Chendeb","lastName":"Taher","id":"38191749700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1642-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1641-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1643-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5696"}],"articleNumber":"8167555","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2144},"abstract":"eHealth is a technology that is growing in importance over time, varying from remote access to Medical Records, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), or Electronic Medical Records (EMR), to real-time data exchange from different on-body sensors coming from different patients.

The demand for ultra-high speed wired and wireless communication systems is also growing in an unprecedented pace. In providing ultra-high data transmission rate as well as reliable communications, error correction codes are playing an ever important role. They can ensure received data being highly reliable under different channel environments. Protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes form a specific type of structured LDPC codes that possess not only excellent error correction capabilities, but also capacity-approaching decoding thresholds. Due to their simple representation, protograph LDPC (PLDPC) code designs can be evaluated and optimized efficiently based on, for example, protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm. In this talk, we will present some state-of-the-art protograph LDPC code designs and their error performance under various channel conditions. We will also extend the applications of protograph LDPC codes to joint source-and-channel coding and joint channel-and-physical-layer-network coding. Finally we present some open problems in this field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167583/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17415708","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Keynote talk #3: Protograph low-density parity-check codes: Design and application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keynote talk #3: Protograph low-density parity-check codes: Design and application","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"14KeynoteTalk3ATC2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038598S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","articleId":"8167583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8167596,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Ito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Ito","id":"37086307131"},{"name":"Toshiharu Kojima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiharu","lastName":"Kojima","id":"37664466900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2898-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2899-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"8167596","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Diversity reception","Correlation","Receivers","Helicopters","Calculators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","diversity reception","error statistics","radio receivers","radio transmitters","satellite communication","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance","sync word","pre-detection combining","code synchronization scheme","helicopter satellite communications","time diversity","bit error rate performance","post-detection combining","synchronization performance","timing offset estimation","computer simulation","periodic channel blockage","BER performance degradation"]}],"abstract":"In helicopter satellite communications, the periodic blockage of the channel due to the rotor blades degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance. Although time diversity is attractive in order to overcome the periodic blockage, the combining process in the receiver requires the code synchronization. The pre-detection combining is suitable for time diversity because it is superior to the post-detection combining in terms of the BER performance. However, a sync word cannot be applied to the code synchronization in the pre-detection combining. To solve this problem, we propose a novel code synchronization scheme. The proposed scheme estimates the timing offset between the transmitter and the receiver on the basis of the cross-correlation of all possible pairs of the encoded sequences to combine. Results of computer simulation show that the proposed scheme achieves excellent synchronization performance without sync word even in the severe environment of helicopter satellite communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on code synchronization for time diversity in helicopter satellite communications","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced

The advantage of PPBF comes from the fact that, no global operation is required during the decoding process and from that, all of the computations could be parallelized and localized at the computing units. Also in PPBF, the probabilistic feature in flipping the Variable Node (VN) is incorporated for all satisfaction level of its CN neighbors. This type of probabilistic incorporation makes PPBF more dynamic to correct some error patterns which are unsolvable by other BF decoders. PPBF offers a faster decoding process with an equivalent error correction performance to the Probabilistic Gradient Descent Bit Flipping (PGDBF) decoder, which is better than all so-far introduced BF decoders in BSC channel. A hardware implementation architecture of PPBF is also presented in this paper with detailed circuits for the probabilistic signal generator and processing units. The implementation of PPBF on FPGA confirms that, the PPBF complexity is much lower than that of the PGDBF and even lower than the one of the deterministic Gradient Descent Bit Flipping (GDBF) decoder. The good decoding performance along with the high throughput and low complexity lead PPBF decoder to become a brilliant candidate for the next generation of communication and storage standards.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167601","startPage":"126","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel high-throughput, low-complexity bit-flipping decoder for LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167601/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A novel high-throughput, low-complexity bit-flipping decoder for LDPC codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415713","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167601/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel high-throughput, low-complexity bit-flipping decoder for LDPC codes","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p126letrung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072234S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119419","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8167577","articleId":"8167601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167602,"authors":[{"name":"Aziz Doukkali","affiliation":["Normandie Universit\u00e9 ENSICAEN/CRISMAT/UMR 6508, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Aziz","lastName":"Doukkali","id":"37085712716"},{"name":"Insaf Lahbib","affiliation":["Normandie Universit\u00e9 ENSICAEN/CRISMAT/UMR 6508, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Insaf","lastName":"Lahbib","id":"37085708173"},{"name":"Patrice Gamand","affiliation":["Labex Sigma-Lim, University of of Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Patrice","lastName":"Gamand","id":"37266970300"},{"name":"Patrick Martin","affiliation":["Normandie Universit\u00e9 ENSICAEN/CRISMAT/UMR 6508, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Martin","id":"37085707904"},{"name":"Dominique Lesenechal","affiliation":["Normandie Universit\u00e9 ENSICAEN/CRISMAT/UMR 6508, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Lesenechal","id":"38319876200"},{"name":"Philippe Descamps","affiliation":["Normandie Universit\u00e9 ENSICAEN/CRISMAT/UMR 6508, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Descamps","id":"37300192800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2898-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2899-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"8167602","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167602","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Radio frequency","Degradation","Reliability","Gain","Stress measurement","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","Ge-Si alloys","low noise amplifiers","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability analysis","high RF power stressing","LNA","in-house reliability tool","cascode low noise amplifiers","wireless applications","small-signal gain","predictive degradation simulations","time 600.0 hour","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LNA Reliability","mixed mode degradation","reverse base-emitter bias","gain degradation","noise figure increase"]}],"abstract":"A reliability study under high RF power stressing was conducted on two SiGe cascode Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) using an in-house reliability tool.

We design the architecture of the central station (CS), the remote antenna unit (RAU), and the remote radio heads (RRHs) to implement the AF relaying technique. The proposed architecture is simplified significantly since it requires only a fiber with a single wavelength as well as a wireless link with a single MMW frequency for bidirectional transmission. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under the effect of various physical layer impairments. The numerical results not only demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed architecture but also indicate the gain in terms of throughput when AF relaying is used.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167615","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167615.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel hybrid fiber-wireless RoF/MMW system using bidirectional amplify-and-forward relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A novel hybrid fiber-wireless RoF/MMW system using bidirectional amplify-and-forward relaying","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167615/","accessionNumber":"17415723","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167615/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hybrid fiber-wireless RoF/MMW system using bidirectional amplify-and-forward relaying","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p192pham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049399S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119419","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","xplore-issue":"8167577","articleId":"8167615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8167616,"authors":[{"name":"Francis C.

In order to save bandwidth, we do not use additional signal header (preamble) in each OFDM frame as proposed in many conventional approaches. Instead, the central sub-carrier is reserved for pilot transmission. This subcarrier is so-called as the carrier frequency pilot (CFP), which is used to detect the Doppler frequency. At the receiver, two synchronization steps are deployed. The first step performs coarse synchronization. In this step, the Doppler frequency is roughly estimated on the basic of the detected carrier frequency. In the second step, we use the CFP to regulate the estimated Doppler frequency. This regulation is called as fine synchronization. The advantage of the proposed method is to reduce the OFDM frame length. Therefore, the system bandwidth can be increased. The proposed method is able to track the fast time-varriation of the Doppler frequency, which is a typical characteristic of the underwater channel. To verify the perfomance of the proposed method, we have tested our approach in real underwater channel with the speed of the relative Rx movement of 3m/s. Experimental results show that the estimated Doppler frequency matches well with the theoretical calculation.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167628","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler compensation method using carrier frequency pilot for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Doppler compensation method using carrier frequency pilot for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167628/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415689","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler compensation method using carrier frequency pilot for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p254hung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060327S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119419","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167577","articleId":"8167628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167631,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Huy Le","affiliation":["Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"],"firstName":"Quang","lastName":"Huy Le","id":"37087365881"},{"name":"Chi Thanh Nghe","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Thanh Nghe","id":"37087366013"},{"name":"Gernot Zimmer","affiliation":["Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main, Germany","Vietnamese-German University, Binh Duong, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Gernot","lastName":"Zimmer","id":"37085389692"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2898-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2899-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"8167631","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistors","Stability analysis","Transistors","Frequency measurement","Gain","Power generation","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum input stabilization","mean gain degradation","optimum impedances","harmonic load impedances","large-signal measurement","small-signal gain","input power level","designed amplifier","output power requirement","wideband amplifier","high-efficiency gallium nitride-HEMT power amplifier","source simulation","load pull simulation","power-added efficiency","power 10.0 W","frequency 1.9 GHz to 2.9 GHz","efficiency 37 percent to 69 percent","gain 13.0 dB to 16.0 dB","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high efficiency","power amplifier","GaN-HEMT","optimum stablization","10 W"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167631","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167631.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency 10 W GaN-HEMT power amplifier with optimum input stabilization","abstract":"In this paper, design of a wideband high efficiency GaN-HEMT power amplifier operating in 1.9\u20132.9 GHz is presented.

Latest studies have showed Space-Frequency Block Code (SFBC) OFDM which was studied thoroughly in radio wireless communication is a promising candidate for underwater acoustic communication. However, currently experimental results of acoustic SFBC-OFDM in underwater environment is quite rare. In this paper, we propose a transceiver architecture of acoustic SFBC-OFDM, and show experimental results taken in Shizuoka, Japan. Additionally, we propose a method for compensating sampling rate error due to imperfection of equipment. Overall, our system consists of 2 transmitters and 4 receivers, utilizing an ultrasonic signal from 20(kHz) to 28(kHz), 160 sub-carriers, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM modulation, sampling speed of 96(kHz). Experimental results confirmed that our proposal system achieves 7.5 (Kbit/sec) data throughput, over more than 30(m) in vertical direction, under harsh channel conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental acoustic SFBC-OFDM for underwater communication","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167639","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167639.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An experimental acoustic SFBC-OFDM for underwater communication","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167639/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415686","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental acoustic SFBC-OFDM for underwater communication","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p43tran.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062499S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119419","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","xplore-issue":"8167577","articleId":"8167639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167640,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh-Binh Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications, Le Quy Don Technical University, 236 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay, Ha Noi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thanh-Binh","lastName":"Nguyen"},{"name":"Tien-Dong Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications, Le Quy Don Technical University, Ha Noi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tien-Dong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085595133"},{"name":"Minh-Tuan Le","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam","MobiFone R&D Center, MobiFone Corporation, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Minh-Tuan","lastName":"Le","id":"37076079600"},{"name":"Vu-Duc Ngo","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam","MobiFone R&D Center, MobiFone Corporation, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vu-Duc","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37085445561"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2898-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2899-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"8167640","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Complexity theory","Receiving antennas","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","iterative methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","linear detectors","massive MIMO system","ZF detector","zero-forcing detectors","group detection approach","computational cost reduction","bit error rate performance","BER performance","computational complexity","ZF-GD approach","ZF-IGD approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Up-link","Low complexity receiver","Group Detection algorithm","Zero Forcing","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose efficient Zero-Forcing (ZF) Detectors based on the a Group Detection (GD) approach in order to reduce the computational cost of the conventional linear detectors when they are adopted in Massive MIMO systems.

This article investigates the application of OCSVM to detect anomalies in WSNs with data-driven hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, the information of the farthest and the nearest neighbors of each sample is used to construct the objective cost instead of labeling based metrics such as geometric mean accuracy (G-mean) or area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The efficiency of this method is illustrated over the IBRL dataset whereas the resulting estimated boundary as well as anomaly detection performance are comparable with existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven hyperparameter optimization of one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2017.8167642","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119419/8167577/08167642.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2017.8167642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167577","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data driven hyperparameter optimization of one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167642/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415730","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven hyperparameter optimization of one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Quy Nhon, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p6trinh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052317S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119419","isNumber":"8167577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119419","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167577","articleId":"8167642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167644,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Thi Thanh Tu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam","Falcuty of Telecommunication 1, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Duong","lastName":"Thi Thanh Tu","id":"37086274719"},{"name":"Nguyen Gia Thang","affiliation":["Falcuty of Telecommunication 1, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Gia Thang","id":"37086305918"},{"name":"Nguyen Tuan Ngoc","affiliation":["Falcuty of Telecommunication 1, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Tuan Ngoc","id":"37086281920"},{"name":"Nguyen Thi Bich Phuong","affiliation":["Falcuty of Telecommunication 1, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Thi Bich Phuong","id":"37086307526"},{"name":"Vu Van Yem","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Van Yem","id":"37671169700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2898-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2899-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"8167644","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":891},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","MIMO","Metamaterials","Antennas","Dual band","Mutual coupling","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna phased arrays","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","photonic band gap","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["round patch EBG cell","dual-band Multiple Input Multiple Output","fifth-generation wireless technology","array single antenna","wide-bands","operating bands","5G wireless technology","dual-band MIMO communication","round patch electromagnetic band gap cell","frequency 38.0 GHz","size 0.7 mm","frequency 28.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-band","5G","EBG","MIMO","low mutual coupling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 4\u00d74 dual-band Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna which operates at 28 and 38 GHz bands for future fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology is proposed.

ReIM-OFDM achieves performance improvement over the convetional IM-OFDM at the same spectral efficiency by providing additional space and frequency diversity. Similar to IM-OFDM, the proposed ReIM-OFDM also activates K out of total N subcarriers to convey information bits using both the active sub-carriers and their indices. However, it differs from IM-OFDM in that all activated sub-carriers are modulated by the same M-ary data symbol. For signal combining, either Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) or Selection Combining (SC) can be used in the spatial and sub-carriers domain to help ReIM-OFDM achieve both space and frequency diversity gain. In order to analyze performance of the system, the Moment Generating Function (MGF) is used to obtain the closed-form expressions for the pairwise index error probability (PEP) and the symbol error probability (SEP) in both cases: ReIM-OFDM-MRC and ReIM-OFDM-SC. Effects of various system parameters on the SEP are analyzed to select the best ReIM-OFDM configuration with minimum error probability.

The growth of urban environments, as well as the use of ICT in enabling applications and services, has encouraged several works on the modeling of transportation. High mobility of vehicles in such a context consists of a significant challenge in modeling traffic. Several microscopic and macroscopic models have been designed aiming to represent the movement of vehicles accurately in road segments, involving different levels of complexity, precision, and realism. Out of these models, Free-flow models have shown useful due to being light and reasonably accurate for estimating load in short-time predictions. A recent free-flow traffic flow modeled using queues assumed constant vehicle speed along the road segment; this assumption may lead to a lack of realism and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a free-flow model based on this previous work where the road segment is split into several intervals, representing the oscillations of the speed of vehicles. The proposed model has shown correctness comparable to the previous free-flow model, considering that it has included speed varying behavior of vehicles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macroscopic interval-split free-flow model for vehicular cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM 21st International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)","doi":"10.1109/DISTRA.2017.8167673","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE/ACM 21st International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8119417/8167651/08167673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DISTRA.2017.8167673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Macroscopic interval-split free-flow model for vehicular cloud computing","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167673/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415653","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macroscopic interval-split free-flow model for vehicular cloud computing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04309S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8119417","isNumber":"8167651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8119417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167651","articleId":"8167673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167682,"authors":[{"name":"Lamia Ben Amor","affiliation":["ReDCAD Laboratory, National School of Engineers of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","LAAS, Univ de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Digital Research Center of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Lamia","lastName":"Ben Amor","id":"37085865134"},{"name":"Imene Lahyani","affiliation":["ReDCAD Laboratory, National School of Engineers of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","LAAS, Univ de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Digital Research Center of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Imene","lastName":"Lahyani","id":"38072779000"},{"name":"Mohamed Jmaiel","affiliation":["ReDCAD Laboratory, National School of Engineers of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France","LAAS, Univ de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Digital Research Center of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jmaiel","id":"37266583300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4028-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4027-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4029-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167682","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Principal component analysis","Robustness","Medical services","Biomedical monitoring","Real-time systems","Physiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health care","mobile computing","principal component analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile healthcare applications","high-quality health services","real-time sensor readings","internal factors","external factors","abnormal readings","online detection","abnormal medical measurements","robust Principal Component Analysis","PCA","collected physiological measurements","multivariate anomalies","squared prediction error","medical dataset","space complexity","abnormal physiological measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multivariate","Anomaly detection","Principal Component Analysis","Robustness","mHealth"]}],"abstract":"Real time mobile Health applications highly depend on sensor readings to provide high-quality health services.

Thus, abnormal readings have a significant impact on the reliability of such applications and consequently affect the patient's life. This paper addresses the following issue by proposing a robust approach for online detection of abnormal medical measurements. The proposed approach is based on robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze collected physiological measurements from sensors and detect the occurrence of multivariate anomalies based on squared prediction error at runtime.

To promote progress toward a cure for multiple sclerosis, the Accelerated Cure Project has created an open repository of biological and survey data on patients with multiple sclerosis. Similar large-scale repositories are being created in other domains. As the open, data-driven model of science proliferates, the research community faces a growing need for a cloud platform for collaborative data science. Such a platform should facilitate collaboration between domain experts and data scientists and possess artificial intelligence capabilities for organizing, recommending, and manipulating data analyses. In this paper, we present some foundational technologies motivated by this vision. Our system automatically extracts a high-level dataflow graph from a data analysis. This graph describes how data flows through an analysis pipeline, including which statistical methods are used and how they fit together. The system requires no special annotations from the data analyst and consumes analyses written in Python using standard tools, such as Scikit-learn and Statsmodels. In this paper, we explain how our system works and how it fits into our larger vision for a collaborative data science platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 Nov.-Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167722/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dataflow representation of data analyses: Toward a platform for collaborative data science","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004316","fundingName":"IBM Science for Social Good initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dataflow representation of data analyses: Toward a platform for collaborative data science","sourcePdf":"jrd-patterson-2736278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071902S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"5288520","isNumber":"8167362","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","xplore-issue":"8167362","articleId":"8167722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8167751,"authors":[{"name":"Hosein Mohammadi Makrani","affiliation":["Electrical and computer engineering department, George Mason University, Fairfax, USA"],"firstName":"Hosein Mohammadi","lastName":"Makrani","id":"37086317773"},{"name":"Houman Homayoun","affiliation":["Electrical and computer engineering department, George Mason University, Fairfax, USA"],"firstName":"Houman","lastName":"Homayoun","id":"37398927100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1233-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1234-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167751","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparks","Optimization","Q measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","file servers","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","optimisation","power aware computing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MeNa","memory navigator","scale-out environment","multicore processors","power consumption","capital cost","processing cores","core frequency","memory hierarchy","memory channels","memory data rate","memory subsystem","performance bottlenecks","operational cost","analytics applications","cloud applications","cloud infrastructure","comprehensive real-system empirical analysis","memory configuration parameters","developed predictive model","cloud environment","processor parameters","system configuration","performance-cost ratio","memory requirements trends","server designers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memory","performance modeling","cost optimization","cloud"]}],"abstract":"Scale-out infrastructure such as Cloud is built upon a large network of multi-core processors. Performance, power consumption, and capital cost of such infrastructure depend on the overall system configuration including number of processing cores, core frequency, memory hierarchy and capacity, number of memory channels, and memory data rate. Among these parameters, memory subsystem is known to be one of the performance bottlenecks, contributing significantly to the overall capital and operational cost of the server. Also, given the rise of Big Data and analytics applications, this could potentially pose an even bigger challenge to the performance of cloud applications and cost of cloud infrastructure. Hence it is important to understand the role of memory subsystem in cloud infrastructure and in particular for this emerging class of applicationas. Despite the increasing interest in recent years, little work has been done in understanding memory requirements trends and developing accurate and effective models to predict performance and cost of memory subsystem. Currently there is no well-defined methodology for selecting a memory configuration that reduces execution time and power consumption by considering the capital and operational cost of cloud. In this paper, through a comprehensive real-system empirical analysis of performance, we address these challenges by first characterizing diverse types of scale-out applications across a wide range of memory configuration parameters. The characterization helps to accurately capture applications' behavior and derive a model to predict their performance. Based on the developed predictive model, we propose MeNa, which is a methodology to maximize the performance/cost ratio of scale-out applications running in cloud environment. MeNa navigates memory and processor parameters to find the system configuration for a given application and a given budget, to maximum performance. Compared to brute force method, MeNa achieves more than 90% accuracy for identifying the right configuration parameters to maximize performance/cost ratio. Moreover, we show how MeNa can be effectively leveraged for server designers to find architectural insights or subscribers to allocate just enough budget to maximize performance of their applications in cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MeNa: A memory navigator for modern hardware in a scale-out environment","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167751","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122074/8167743/08167751.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"MeNa: A memory navigator for modern hardware in a scale-out environment","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167751/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17398325","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MeNa: A memory navigator for modern hardware in a scale-out environment","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01iiswc2017final50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.188097S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167754,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed E.

To streamline this daunting process, researchers have proposed several \u201cblack-box\u201d performance prediction approaches that rely on the performance of a training set of parallel applications. However, due to the lack of a diverse set of applications along with their optimized parallel implementations for each architecture type, the predicted speedup by these approaches is not the speedup upper-bound, and even worse it can be misleading, if the reference parallel implementations are not equally-optimized for every target architecture. This paper presents AutoMatch, an automated framework for matching of compute kernels to heterogeneous HPC architectures. AutoMatch uses hybrid (static and dynamic) analysis to find the best dependency-preserving parallel schedule of a given sequential code. The resulting operations schedule serves as a basis to construct a cost function of the optimized parallel execution of the sequential code on heterogeneous HPC nodes. Since such a cost function informs the user and runtime system about the relative execution cost across the different hardware devices within HPC nodes, AutoMatch enables efficient runtime workload distribution that simultaneously utilizes all the available devices in performance-proportional way. For a set of open-source HPC applications with different characteristics, AutoMatch turns out to be very effective, identifying the speedup upper-bound of sequential applications and how close the parallel implementation is to the best parallel performance across five different HPC architectures. Furthermore, AutoMatch's workload distribution scheme achieves approximately 90% of the performance of a profiling-driven oracle.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167754","startPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122074/8167743/08167754.pdf","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167754/","displayDocTitle":"AutoMatch: An automated framework for relative performance estimation and workload distribution on heterogeneous HPC systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167754/","accessionNumber":"17416234","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AutoMatch: An automated framework for relative performance estimation and workload distribution on heterogeneous HPC systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"04iiswc2017final95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132819S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167755,"authors":[{"name":"Shin-Ying Lee","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Shin-Ying","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085764999"},{"name":"Carole-Jean Wu","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Carole-Jean","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085392155"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1233-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1234-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167755","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Interference","Kernel","Performance evaluation","Acceleration","Hardware","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","performance evaluation","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous computer systems","execution time slowdown","heterogeneous computation environment","performance characterization","multilevel memory interference","hardware accelerators","scheduling algorithms","optimal target device","execution behavior","OpenCL kernel execution scheduling","system throughput maximization","colocated applications","HeteroPDP","energy consumption reduction"]}],"abstract":"Modern computer systems are accelerator-rich, equipped with many types of hardware accelerators to speed up computation. For example, graphics processing units (GPUs) are a type of accelerators that are widely employed to accelerate parallel workloads. In order to well utilize different accelerators to gain better execution time speedup or reduce total energy consumption, many scheduling algorithms have been proposed to select the optimal target device to process an OpenCL kernel according to the kernel's individual characteristics. However, in a real computer system, there are a lot of workloads co-located together on a single machine and would be processed on different devices simultaneously. The CPU cores and accelerators may contend shared resources, such as the host main memory and shared last-level cache. Thus, it is not robust to schedule an OpenCL kernel execution by simply considering the characteristics of the kernel. To maximize the system throughput, it is important to consider the execution behavior of all co-located applications when performing OpenCL kernel execution scheduling. In this paper, we provide a detailed characterization study demonstrating that scheduling an OpenCL kernel to run on different devices can introduce varying performance impact to itself and the other co-located applications due to memory interference. Based on the characterization results, we then develop a light-weight, scalable performance degradation predictor specifically for heterogeneous computer systems, called HeteroPDP. HeteroPDP aims to dynamically predict and balance the execution time slowdown of all co-located applications in a heterogeneous computation environment. Our real system evaluation results show that comparing with always running an OpenCL kernel on the host CPU, HeteroPDP is able to achieve 3X execution time speedup when an OpenCL kernel runs alone and improve the system fairness from 24% to 65% when an OpenCL kernel is co-located with other applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance characterization, prediction, and optimization for heterogeneous systems with multi-level memory interference","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167755","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122074/8167743/08167755.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance characterization, prediction, and optimization for heterogeneous systems with multi-level memory interference","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167755/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416226","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance characterization, prediction, and optimization for heterogeneous systems with multi-level memory interference","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"05iiswc2017final27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094592S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167759,"authors":[{"name":"Miryeong Kwon","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Memory Systems Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Miryeong","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37086294934"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Memory Systems Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086286369"},{"name":"Gyuyoung Park","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Memory Systems Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Gyuyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37086288867"},{"name":"Wonil Choi","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Wonil","lastName":"Choi","id":"37086234138"},{"name":"David Donofrio","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Donofrio","id":"37671269300"},{"name":"John Shalf","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Shalf","id":"37281789600"},{"name":"Mahmut Kandemir","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Mahmut","lastName":"Kandemir","id":"37275431900"},{"name":"Myoungsoo Jung","affiliation":["Computer Architecture and Memory Systems Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University"],"firstName":"Myoungsoo","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086289507"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1233-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1234-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167759","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167759","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Delays","Servers","Hardware","Software","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal verification","hardware-software codesign","software performance evaluation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware software co-evaluation","block traces","TraceTracker software evaluation model","storage traces","IO workload reconstruction","runtime contexts","detailed block access patterns","model verifications"]}],"abstract":"Block traces are widely used for system studies, model verifications, and design analyses in both industry and academia. While such traces include detailed block access patterns, existing trace-driven research unfortunately often fails to find true-north due to a lack of runtime contexts such as user idle periods and system delays, which are fundamentally linked to the characteristics of target storage hardware. In this work, we propose TraceTracker, a novel hardware/software co-evaluation method that allows users to reuse a broad range of the existing block traces by keeping most their execution contexts and user scenarios while adjusting them with new system information. Specifically, our TraceTracker's software evaluation model can infer CPU burst times and user idle periods from old storage traces, whereas its hardware evaluation method remasters the storage traces by interoperating the inferred time information, and updates all inter-arrival times by making them aware of the target storage system. We apply the proposed co-evaluation model to 577 traces, which were collected by servers from different institutions and locations a decade ago, and revive the traces on a high-performance flash-based storage array. The evaluation results reveal that the accuracy of the execution contexts reconstructed by TraceTracker is on average 99% and 96% with regard to the frequency of idle operations and the total idle periods, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167759","startPage":"87","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122074/8167743/08167759.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TraceTracker: Hardware/software co-evaluation for large-scale I/O workload reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167759/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"TraceTracker: Hardware/software co-evaluation for large-scale I/O workload reconstruction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416228","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167759/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TraceTracker: Hardware/software co-evaluation for large-scale I/O workload reconstruction","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"09iiswc2017final9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091449S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167762,"authors":[{"name":"Sukhan Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Sukhan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085378314"},{"name":"Yuhwan Ro","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Yuhwan","lastName":"Ro","id":"37086060163"},{"name":"Young Hoon Son","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics"],"firstName":"Young Hoon","lastName":"Son","id":"37085360811"},{"name":"Hyunyoon Cho","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics"],"firstName":"Hyunyoon","lastName":"Cho","id":"38063696500"},{"name":"Nam Sung Kim","affiliation":["University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Nam Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085628455"},{"name":"Jung Ho Ahn","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673865600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1233-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1234-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167762","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Random access memory","Power demand","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Data transfer","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","energy conservation","low-power electronics","memory architecture","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM devices","energy efficiency","power-performance relationship","LPDDR4 devices","mobile graphics memory","DDR4 devices","power consumption","mobile LPDDR devices","energy consumption","big-memory servers","highest energy-consuming component","main-memory systems","memory modules"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167762","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122074/8167743/08167762.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167762","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2017.8167762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167743","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding power-performance relationship of energy-efficient modern DRAM devices","abstract":"As servers are equipped with more memory modules each with larger capacity, main-memory systems are now the second highest energy-consuming component in big-memory servers and their energy consumption even becomes comparable to processors in some servers. Meanwhile, it is critical for big-memory servers and their main-memory systems to offer high energy efficiency. Prior work exploited mobile LPDDR devices' advantages (lower power than DDR devices) while attempting to surmount their limitations (longer latency, lower bandwidth, or both). However, we demonstrate that such main memory architectures (based on the latest LPDDR4 devices) are no longer effective. This is because the power consumption of present DDR4 devices has substantially decreased by adopting the strength of mobile and graphics memory whereas LPDDR4 has sacrificed energy efficiency and focused more on increasing data transfer rates; we also exhibit that the power consumption of DDR4 devices can substantially vary across manufacturers. Moreover, investigating a new energy-saving feature of DDR4 devices in depth, we show that activating this feature often hurts overall energy efficiency of servers due to its performance penalties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167762/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17416217","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Understanding power-performance relationship of energy-efficient modern DRAM devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding power-performance relationship of energy-efficient modern DRAM devices","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"12iiswc2017final16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049781S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8167764,"authors":[{"name":"Crefeda Faviola Rodrigues","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Crefeda Faviola","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37086281415"},{"name":"Graham Riley","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Graham","lastName":"Riley","id":"37436873700"},{"name":"Mikel Luj\u00e1n","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Mikel","lastName":"Luj\u00e1n","id":"37392848800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1233-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1232-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1234-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167764","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":758},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Machine learning","Energy measurement","Performance evaluation","Mobile handsets","Energy consumption","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","graphics processing units","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","power aware computing","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power devices","network size","deep neural networks","ARMs Streamline Performance Analyser","NVidia Jetson TX1","neural network","deep convolutional neural networks","Maxwell GPU","image classification","standard deep learning","fine-grained energy profiling","device-specific software"]}],"abstract":"Energy-use is a key concern when migrating current deep learning applications onto low power heterogeneous devices such as a mobile device.

In order to make ReRAM highly scalable, the memory array has to have a crossbar array structure, which needs a specific access mechanism for activating a row of memory when reading/writing a data block from/to it. This type of memory access would cause Sneak Current that would lead to voltage drop on the memory cells of the activated row, i.e., the cells which are far from the write drivers experience more voltage drop compared to those close to them. This results in a nonuniform access latency for the cells of the same row. To address this problem, we propose and evaluate a scheme that exploits the non-uniformity of write access pattern of the workloads. More specifically, based on our extensive characterization of write patterns to the cache lines and memory pages of 20 CPU workloads, we recognized that (i) on each main memory access, just a few cache lines of the activated row need to be updated on a write-back, and more importantly, there is a temporal and spatial locality of the writes to the cache lines; and (ii) all pages of the memory footprint of an application do not see the same write counts during the execution of the workload. Motivated by these characteristics, we then evaluate different intra-page memory block permutations in order to improve the performance of a crossbar ReRAM-based main memory. Our results collectively show that, by applying some types of intra-page memory block permutation, the access latency to a ReRAM-based main memory can be reduced up to 50% when running the SPEC CPU2006 workloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167774/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416230","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exploring the impact of memory block permutation on performance of a crossbar ReRAM main memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring the impact of memory block permutation on performance of a crossbar ReRAM main memory","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"24iiswc2017final41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108621S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122074","isNumber":"8167743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122074","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8167743","articleId":"8167774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167800,"authors":[{"name":"Jaclynn J.

We demonstrate the use of transfer learning on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to significantly reduce training time while keeping detection accuracy of physical security relevant targets high. Unlike many detection algorithms employed by video analytics within physical security systems, this method does not rely on temporal data to construct a background scene; targets of interest can halt motion indefinitely and still be detected by the implemented CNN. A key advantage of using deep learning is the ability for a network to improve over time. Periodic retraining can lead to better detection and higher confidence rates. We investigate training data size versus CNN test accuracy using physical security video data. Due to the large number of visible imagers, significant volume of data collected daily, and currently deployed human in the loop ground truth data, physical security systems present a unique environment that is well suited for analysis via CNNs. This could lead to the creation of algorithmic element that reduces human burden and decreases human analyzed nuisance alarms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical security assessment with convolutional neural network transfer learning","doi":"10.1109/CCST.2017.8167800","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167784","publicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122075/8167784/08167800.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Physical security assessment with convolutional neural network transfer learning","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167800/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416286","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical security assessment with convolutional neural network transfer learning","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"s2a4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0417S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122075","isNumber":"8167784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122075","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167784","articleId":"8167800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167816,"authors":[{"name":"Ilias Chamatidis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics, University of Thessaly, Lamia, Greece"],"firstName":"Ilias","lastName":"Chamatidis","id":"37086300109"},{"name":"Aggeliki Katsika","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics, University of Thessaly, Lamia, Greece"],"firstName":"Aggeliki","lastName":"Katsika","id":"37086301633"},{"name":"Georgios Spathoulas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics, University of Thessaly, Lamia, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Spathoulas","id":"37669781000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1585-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1586-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"}],"articleNumber":"8167816","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":708},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Authentication","Biometrics (access control)","Feature extraction","Discrete cosine transforms","Neural networks","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","neural nets","signal classification","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning neural networks","ECG based authentication","biometric authentication","classification models","user authentication","transformation-classifier combination","Electrocardiograms","noise removal","distortion removal","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["authentication","biometrics","classification","deep learning neural networks","electrocardiogram","feature selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCST.2017.8167816","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122075/8167784/08167816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using deep learning neural networks for ECG based authentication","abstract":"Traditional password based authentication has been proven inadequate and the use of biometrics have provided multiple solutions through the past years. One of the most recent approaches to biometric authentication is using Electrocardiograms (ECG), as they are closely related to unique characteristics of the heart of each person. In this paper a framework for efficient and usable user authentication, based on ECG, is proposed. The ECG is pre-processed in order to remove any noise or distortions and then multiple set of features are extracted from it, through various transformations. These set of features are used as input to classification models and the results are compared in order to find the most effective transformation-classifier combination, which also sets a performance baseline. Additionally Deep Learning Neural Networks are used in order to create classification models that predicts whether an ECG belongs to a specific person or not, based on the combination of the feature sets produced in the transformation step. The results obtained have shown that deep learning neural networks can provide higher accuracy in comparison to most of other techniques used, if there are enough data to train them on.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167816/","accessionNumber":"17416305","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167816/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using deep learning neural networks for ECG based authentication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using deep learning neural networks for ECG based authentication","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"s4a3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063395S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122075","isNumber":"8167784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122075","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8167784","articleId":"8167816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8167824,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Schuch","affiliation":["Norwegian Biometrics Lab, NTNU, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Schuch","id":"37086098481"},{"name":"Simon Schulz","affiliation":["Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37086009218"},{"name":"Christoph Busch","affiliation":["Norwegian Biometrics Lab, NTNU, Gj\u00f8vik, Norway"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Busch","id":"37368939900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1585-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1586-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"}],"articleNumber":"8167824","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"abstract":"Image enhancement is a common pre-processing step before the extraction of biometric features from a fingerprint sample.

An ideal fingerprint image enhancement should intend to improve the end-to-end biometric performance, i.e. the performance achieved on biometric features extracted from enhanced fingerprint samples. We use a model from Deep Learning for the task of image enhancement. This work's main contribution is a dedicated cost function which is optimized during training The cost function takes into account the biometric feature extraction. Our approach intends to improve the accuracy and reliability of the biometric feature extraction process: No feature should be missed and all features should be extracted as precise as possible. By doing so, the loss function forced the image enhancement to learn how to improve the suitability of a fingerprint sample for a biometric comparison process. The effectivity of the cost function was demonstrated for two different biometric feature extraction algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Cost function","Biometrics (access control)","Training","Image enhancement","Reliability","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","feature extraction","fingerprint identification","image enhancement","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low image quality","ideal fingerprint image enhancement","end-to-end biometric performance","biometric features","enhanced fingerprint samples","fingerprint sample","biometric comparison process","biometric feature extraction","minutia-based enhancement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCST.2017.8167824","publicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122075/8167784/08167824.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minutia-based enhancement of fingerprint samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minutia-based enhancement of fingerprint samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167824/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167824/","accessionNumber":"17416256","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minutia-based enhancement of fingerprint samples","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"s5a3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056859S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122075","isNumber":"8167784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122075","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167784","articleId":"8167824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167826,"authors":[{"name":"Juan C.

The proposed approach relies on a variable spatial window based on object size that has shown robustness in scenarios that present motion of objects of different sizes. We propose a system composed of four building blocks: background subtraction, feature extraction, event modeling and outlier detection. The proposed approach is evaluated on publicly available datasets which contain instances of abandoned objects of different sizes (considered as anomalies). The experiments carried out demonstrate that our approach outperforms the related state-of-the-art in the selected datasets.

magnetometer: An analysis of the portability of the fingerprints","abstract":"The identification of mobile phones through their built-in electronic sensors has been proven in literature for cameras, microphones and accelerometers demonstrating to have various applications in security, forensics or in the fight against the counterfeiting of electronic products. The identification of a sensor (and consequently of the mobile phone) is possible through the exploitation of small but significant differences in the physical components of the sensor itself. These physical differences are mainly generated during the production process of the sensor in the manufacturing plant producing small but reproducible variations in the digital output generated by the built-in sensor. In particular, in this paper, we investigate the identification of mobile phones through the built-in magnetometer sensor, which has received very limited attention by the research community so far. In particular, the specific aspects of robustness and portability of such a fingerprint have been analyzed. Different stimulation conditions, diverse kinds of features and classification procedures have been considered achieving very promising results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167855/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416293","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The identification of mobile phones through the fingerprints of their built-in magnetometer: An analysis of the portability of the fingerprints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The identification of mobile phones through the fingerprints of their built-in magnetometer: An analysis of the portability of the fingerprints","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"s8b2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057478S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122075","isNumber":"8167784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122075","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167784","articleId":"8167855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8167861,"authors":[{"name":"Gianmarco Baldini","affiliation":["Directorate for Space, Security and Migration European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianmarco","lastName":"Baldini","id":"37391401100"},{"name":"Gary Steri","affiliation":["Directorate for Space, Security and Migration European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Steri","id":"37680681500"},{"name":"Raimondo Giuliani","affiliation":["Directorate for Space, Security and Migration European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Raimondo","lastName":"Giuliani","id":"37085502198"},{"name":"Claudio Gentile","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical and Applied Sciences, Universita of Insubria, Varese, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Gentile","id":"38358471900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1585-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1586-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"}],"articleNumber":"8167861","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Radio frequency","Feature extraction","Wireless communication","RF signals","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fingerprint identification","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","radiofrequency identification","statistical analysis","telecommunication security","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imaging time series","electronic devices","radio frequency emissions","RF fingerprinting","RF emissions","image processing features","internet of things radio frequency fingerprinting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167861","abstract":"The concept of Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is that electronic devices can be identified and authenticated through their radio frequency emissions, which contain intrinsic features of the device itself. RF fingerprinting can be used to enhance the security of wireless networks because the fingerprints provide a form of authentication. In previous research papers, the RF fingerprints have typically been obtained by extracting statistical features from the time series generated by the analog-to-digital conversion of the RF emissions. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to the RF fingerprinting of Internet of Things (IOT) devices, where the time series are converted into images, out of which image processing features are extracted. The performance of this approach is experimentally evaluated by applying different machine learning algorithms on different types of conversions of time series to images. Our analysis shows that the proposed approach provides a better identification accuracy as compared to the accuracy achieved by conventional sets of statistical features used in the literature. Even if relatively small (around 1%), this accuracy improvement is statistically significant when classification is repeated over different folds of the training and test data. Yet, this enhanced accuracy is obtained at the cost of the longer time taken to process the images.","doi":"10.1109/CCST.2017.8167861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCST.2017.8167861","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122075/8167784/08167861.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging time series for internet of things radio frequency fingerprinting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Imaging time series for internet of things radio frequency fingerprinting","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167861/","accessionNumber":"17416301","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167861/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging time series for internet of things radio frequency fingerprinting","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"s9b1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051808S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122075","isNumber":"8167784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122075","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8167784","articleId":"8167861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8167863,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Garzia","affiliation":["DICMA, SAPIENZA \u2014 University of Rome Rome, Italy","European Academy of Sciences and Arts, Salzburg, Austria","Wessex Institute of Technology, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Garzia","id":"37423092900"},{"name":"Mara Lombardi","affiliation":["DICMA, SAPIENZA \u2014 University of Rome Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mara","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37085509285"},{"name":"Soodamani Ramalingam","affiliation":["Division of Electronics, Communications and Electrical Engineering, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfiled, UK"],"firstName":"Soodamani","lastName":"Ramalingam","id":"37603417300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1585-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1586-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"}],"articleNumber":"8167863","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Personnel","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Risk management","Safety","Tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency management","genetic algorithms","intelligent sensors","Internet of Things","neural nets","safety systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated security system","IoE system","genetic algorithms controller","artificial neural networks framework","security/safety systems management","wireless networks","safe management","emergency situations","emergency management","internet of everything","voluntary attacks","integrated IoE-GAC-ANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Everything","IoE","Internet of Things","IoT","IoE/IoT integrated security system","Genetic Algorithms","Genetic Algorithms Controllers(GAC)","Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167863","abstract":"Security/Safety is managed, mostly, by means of integrated systems which have to consider, more and more, sensors, devices, cameras, mobile terminals, wearable devices, etc. that use wireless networks, to ensure protection of people and/or tangible/intangible assets from voluntary attacks, allowing also the safe management of the related consequent emergency situations that can derive from the above mentioned voluntary attacks. These aims can be achieved using integrated systems and innovative technologies, such as Internet of Everything (IoE) which can connect people, things (mobile terminals, smart sensors, devices, actuators; wearable devices; etc.), data/information/knowledge and particular processes. An integrated security system can therefore be considered as an IoE system where several devices, sensors, cameras, people, etc. interact, generating a huge volume of data and information that is necessary to transmit, analyze and eventually store for security purposes and, ultimately, for emergency management derived from voluntary attacks. This means that it is necessary to use suitable tools capable of analyzing, in a smart way, the huge volume of information to achieve the desired security/safety objectives and eventual emergency management of critical situations.

These networks basically consist of the convolution, pooling, and the nonlinearity layers, each of which operates on the representation produced by the preceding layer and generates a new representation. Convolution layers naturally compute some inner product between a plane represented by the weight parameters and input patches. Recently, Generalized Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) have been introduced which justify the use of some kernels or distance functions in place of the inner product operator inside the convolution layers. Although GCNNs gained interesting results on the MNIST dataset, their application to more challenging datasets is hindered by lack of an efficient implementation. In this paper, we focus on a specific generalized convolution operator which is based on the weighted L2 norm distance (WL2Dist). By replacing the nonlinear part with three convolution operators and using effective matrix-matrix multiplications, we were able to efficiently compute the WL2Dist convolution layer both on CPU and GPU. Our experiments show that, on CPU (GPU), the proposed implementation of the WL2Dist layer achieves a 5.5x (21x) speed-up over the initial BLAS-based (CUDA-based) implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167877","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167877.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of a generalized convolutional neural networks based on weighted euclidean distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation of a generalized convolutional neural networks based on weighted euclidean distance","htmlLink":"/document/8167877/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416066","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation of a generalized convolutional neural networks based on weighted euclidean distance","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058763S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167880,"authors":[{"name":"Moein Owhadi-Kareshk","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Soft Computing and Intelligent Information Processing (SCIIP), Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM), Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Moein","lastName":"Owhadi-Kareshk","id":"37085629474"},{"name":"Yasser Sedaghat","affiliation":["Dependable Distributed Embedded Systems (DDEmS) Laboratory, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM), Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Yasser","lastName":"Sedaghat","id":"37830388700"},{"name":"Mohammad-R.

We propose to use a pre-training technique for a shallow, i.e. with fewer hidden layers, Artificial Neural Network (ANN). While this method is usually employed to prevent over-fitting in deep ANNs, our results indicate that even in a shallow network, it improves the accuracy by escaping from local minima. We compare the proposed method with four SVM-based classifiers and a regular ANN without pre-training on seven datasets from NASA codes in the PROMISE repository. Results confirm that the pre-training improves accuracy by achieving the best overall ranking of 1.43.

A network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes and collecting information from the environment in a distributed environment. The main limitations include limited energy, low communication capacity, low storage volume, and low bandwidth. This study provides a clustering method for network nodes by optimized particle swarm and fuzzy approach. This method determines the cluster head according to node's distances from each other and the left amount of energy and the distance from the sink and the density of each node, and determines the rest of the nodes in the network as sub clusters. Selecting the number and the place of cluster heads in order to have the most energy efficiency in the network is a Np-Hard problem, and on the other hand PSO algorithms is very flexible in solving dynamic problems. In this method we maintain the coverage and reduce the energy consumption by combining the particle swarm algorithms and fuzzy approach. This method is faster than the other methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167889","startPage":"20","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the combination of particle swarm algorithms and fuzzy approach to provide a clustering method for network nodes with coverage maintenance in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167889/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using the combination of particle swarm algorithms and fuzzy approach to provide a clustering method for network nodes with coverage maintenance in wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167889/","accessionNumber":"17416120","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the combination of particle swarm algorithms and fuzzy approach to provide a clustering method for network nodes with coverage maintenance in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059224S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167890,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Amiri","affiliation":["Electrical Engineer Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Amiri","id":"37086300151"},{"name":"Sanaz Seyedin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineer Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sanaz","lastName":"Seyedin","id":"37871046300"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Ahadi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineer Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad","lastName":"Ahadi","id":"37265110300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0804-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0805-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167890","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167890","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Clustering algorithms","Blind source separation","Time-domain analysis","Matrix decomposition","Spectrogram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","matrix decomposition","pattern clustering","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal to interference ratio","signal to distortion ratio","SIR","SDR","TIMIT database","multilayer KL-CNMF components","monorecording decomposition","multilayer Kullback-Leibler-complex NMF","unsupervised learning","supervised learning","fuzzy initial clustering","nonnegative matrix factorization","speech source separation","audio forensics","music transcription","blind source separation","speech sources","LPC error clustering","BSS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-layer KL-CNMF","LPC ERROR clustering","Blind source separation","fuzzy clustering"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer Kullback-Leibler-based Complex NMF with LPC error clustering for blind source separation","startPage":"272","endPage":"276","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167890.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167890","abstract":"In many applications such as music transcription, audio forensics, and speech source separation, it is needed to decompose a mono recording into its respective sources.

One of the methods recently used in BSS is non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) both in supervised and unsupervised learning cases. In this paper, we propose a novel NMF-based algorithm namely, multi-layer KL-CNMF (Kullback-Leibler-Complex NMF) using fuzzy initial clustering to improve the performance of BSS in the unsupervised mode. In addition, we use LPC error clustering as a powerful criterion especially for separating harmonic signals such as certain speech sources from their multi-layer KL-CNMF components. The results on speech mixtures of the TIMIT database based on signal to distortion ratio (SDR) and signal to interference ratio (SIR) show that the proposed system significantly outperforms the baseline system which is an NMF-based BSS with LPC error clustering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167890/","accessionNumber":"17416082","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer Kullback-Leibler-based Complex NMF with LPC error clustering for blind source separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer Kullback-Leibler-based Complex NMF with LPC error clustering for blind source separation","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056513S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167893,"authors":[{"name":"Farideh Sanei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandarabbas, Iran"],"firstName":"Farideh","lastName":"Sanei","id":"37086333315"},{"name":"Abbas Harifi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandarabbas, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Harifi","id":"38228126700"},{"name":"Shahram Golzari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Hormozgan, Bandarabbas, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Golzari","id":"37697676900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0804-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0805-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167893","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"Precision improvement of the classifiers is one of the main challenges for the Artificial Intelligence researchers.

By performing numerical results, we evaluate the use of low-resolution ADCs for uplink massive MIMO by analyzing Bit Error Rate (BER) performance for different detection techniques (MMSE, ZF) and different modulations (QPSK, 16-QAM) to find an optimal quantization resolution. Our results reveal that the BER performance of uplink massive MIMO systems with a few-bit resolution ADCs is comparable to the case of having full precision ADCs.

Also, a lot of feature selection techniques have been developed to reduce the high dimension of extracted features of images in SPECT. In this paper, a method has been proposed for early diagnosis of CAD from SPECT heart images. The Cuckoo Search and Genetic algorithm are employed for selecting the optimal set of features which can lessen feature vector dimension from 44 to 5 features. Detection rate of 77.19% is obtained by using Bagging algorithm for classifying SPECT data.

The model shows the effect of anti-retrovirus drugs in different stages of infection. The optimal controller is achieved by Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this paper we find appropriate efficacies of a drug that minimize the virus particles for a deterministic model and stochastic model. To design the optimal stochastic controller, the stochastic model is converted to a deterministic model. Genetic Algorithm provides discrete constraints. A nonlinear constraint changed into two linear constraints by discretization. In the first part of simulation, the behavior of the system with constant value of efficacy is shown. Finally, for the objective of this problem different values of efficacy are found, which leads to the best drug dosage.

Software systems become larger and more complex every day, and due to the time and cost limitations, it is infeasible to test everything in a software with a large configuration space, or a graphical user interface with many settings and events. Combinatorial testing generates an interaction test suite to discover faults caused by parameter interactions using a systematic sampling method. Generation of an optimal test suite in combinatorial testing despite the necessity of determining the execution order of test cases and considering constraints is a challenging process. In this paper, we consider the combinatorial testing as a multiobjective optimization problem and propose a novel approach to generate combinatorial test cases by considering all metrics simultaneously. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating test suites with reduced size and increased priority while the higher priority test cases are generated earlier and the higher priority parameter-values appear more frequently.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","optimisation","program testing","sampling methods","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software systems","systematic sampling","multiobjective optimization","combinatorial test cases","optimal test suite","interaction test suite","combinatorial testing","combinatorial test case generation","higher priority test cases","test suites"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software testing","automatic test case generation","combinatorial testing","covering array","pairwise testing","multi objective genetic algorithm","NSGA-II"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167914","startPage":"411","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167914.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for combinatorial test case generation using multi objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for combinatorial test case generation using multi objective optimization","accessionNumber":"17416076","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167914/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for combinatorial test case generation using multi objective optimization","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122866S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8167926,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Hajiabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Hajiabadi","id":"37085385199"},{"name":"Hossein Khoshbin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Khoshbin","id":"37284690900"},{"name":"Ghoshe Abed Hodtani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad"],"firstName":"Ghoshe Abed","lastName":"Hodtani","id":"37086264042"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0804-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0805-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167926","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Linear antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Gaussian noise","Adaptive arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Gaussian noise","impulse noise","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise profile","second-order statistics","impulsive noise","received signal","beamforming problem","nonGaussian noise environments","information theoretic learning criteria","nonGaussian environments","linearly constrained version","maximum correntropy learning algorithm","nonGaussian noises","impulsive noises","adaptive beamformer","linearly constrained maximum correntropy learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filter","beamforming","constrained optimization","correntropy criterion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167926","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167926","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","abstract":"The Gaussian noise profile has been demonstrated to be an inaccurate model in several antenna beamforming problems.

According to the robust performance of information theoretic learning (ITL) criteria in nonGaussian environments, we propose a linearly constrained version of maximum correntropy learning algorithm in order to solve beamforming problem in presence of nonGaussian and impulsive noises.

Changes in the electrical systems are inevitable with the advent of challenges and issues in energy markets. The rapid expansion of energy systems required smart grid and services like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with two-way interaction. Since devices in smart grid are producing large volumes of data and require vast storage capacity and processing power to analyze it, these services are deployed in a small area. As the count of customers and the amount of producing data grows, we need a scalable platform. Cloud computing provides a platform that matches these requirements and can be used as a solution for smart grids. Interactions between utilities and customers are done by OpenADR standard. This standard used for sending and receiving demand response signals. We implement OpenADR with AMI support in cloud computing environments and evaluate critical parameters such as required bandwidth and resources for deploying this standard. We formulate the relations between price and response time. Utilities and third-party companies can use this result to forecast amount of resources and investment for building infrastructure and deploying this standard.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167931","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167931.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and evaluation of OpenADR standard with AMI support in cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167931/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and evaluation of OpenADR standard with AMI support in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8167931/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416068","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and evaluation of OpenADR standard with AMI support in cloud computing","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063741S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8167949,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Reza Heravi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ahmad Reza","lastName":"Heravi","id":"37085775673"},{"name":"Ghosheh Abed Hodtani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ghosheh Abed","lastName":"Hodtani","id":"38494598200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0804-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0805-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8167949","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Entropy","Mathematical model","Neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Equalizers","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","backpropagation","channel estimation","Gaussian noise","gradient methods","mean square error methods","minimum entropy methods","neural nets","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error","MSE algorithm","MEE algorithm","neural networks training","additive nonGaussian noise channel estimation","wireless communications","minimum error entropy criterion","BP method","conjugate gradient backpropagation algorithm","channel models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Entropy","Mean square error","Neural network","Information theoretic learning","Channel estimation","Backpropagation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Channel estimation is an important component of wireless communications. This paper deals with the comparison between Mean Square Error (MSE) based neural networks and Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) based neural networks in additive non-Gaussian noise channel estimation. This essay analyzes MEE and MSE algorithms in several channel models utilizing neural networks. The aim of this study is first to compare the performance of an MSE-based conjugate gradient backpropagation (BP) algorithm with MEE-based BP method. The trained neural networks can be applied as an equalizer in the receiver. Moreover, to make a complete comparison between methods, we compare them in both low and high SNR regimes. The numerical results illustrate that MEE-based back propagation algorithm is more capable than the MSE-based algorithm for channel estimation. In fact, with additive non-Gaussian noise the performance of the MSE can be approximately as same as the MEE results in high SNR regime, but the MEE outperforms MSE-based method obviously in low SNR regime with non-Gaussian noise.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167865","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122072/8167865/08167949.pdf","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Additive non-Gaussian noise channel estimation by using minimum error entropy criterion","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2017.8167949","startPage":"181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8167949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Additive non-Gaussian noise channel estimation by using minimum error entropy criterion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8167949/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416096","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8167949/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Additive non-Gaussian noise channel estimation by using minimum error entropy criterion","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07135S","chronDate":"26-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122072","isNumber":"8167865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122072","xplore-issue":"8167865","articleId":"8167949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168037,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandr B.

In this study, a probabilistic learning framework to estimate the DNN parameters for single-channel speech enhancement is proposed. First, the statistical analysis shows that the prediction error vector at the DNN output well follows a unimodal density for each log-power spectral component. Accordingly, we present a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to DNN parameter learning by charactering the prediction error vector as a multivariate Gaussian density with a zero mean vector and an unknown covariance matrix. It is demonstrated that the proposed learning approach can achieve a better generalization capability than MMSE-based DNN learning for unseen noise types, which can significantly reduce the speech distortions in low SNR environments.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian density guided deep neural network for single-channel speech enhancement","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian density guided deep neural network for single-channel speech enhancement","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416152","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168116/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian density guided deep neural network for single-channel speech enhancement","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07298S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168119,"authors":[{"name":"Szu-Wei Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Szu-Wei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086027185"},{"name":"Ting-yao Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburg, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ting-yao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086271422"},{"name":"Yu Tsao","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37311610300"},{"name":"Xugang Lu","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Xugang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37422620200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectrogram","Noise measurement","Speech enhancement","Speech","Signal to noise ratio","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex spectrogram enhancement","single objective function","multiple metrics","RI spectrograms","enhanced speech waveforms","log-power spectrogram","unified objective function","commonly used objective metrics","speech enhancement task","speech enhancement methods","convolutional neural network model","LPS","segmental signal-to-noise ratio","SSNR","log-spectral distortion","LSD","multimetrics learning","MML","standardized evaluation metrics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","complex spectrogram","speech enhancement","phase processing","multi-objective learning"]}],"abstract":"This paper aims to address two issues existing in the current speech enhancement methods: 1) the difficulty of phase estimations; 2) a single objective function cannot consider multiple metrics simultaneously. To solve the first problem, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for complex spectrogram enhancement, namely estimating clean real and imaginary (RI) spectrograms from noisy ones. The reconstructed RI spectrograms are directly used to synthesize enhanced speech waveforms. In addition, since log-power spectrogram (LPS) can be represented as a function of RI spectrograms, its reconstruction is also considered as another target. Thus a unified objective function, which combines these two targets (reconstruction of RI spectrograms and LPS), is equivalent to simultaneously optimizing two commonly used objective metrics: segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and log-spectral distortion (LSD). Therefore, the learning process is called multi-metrics learning (MML). Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CNN with RI spectrograms and MML in terms of improved standardized evaluation metrics on a speech enhancement task.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168119","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168119.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex spectrogram enhancement by convolutional neural network with multi-metrics learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Complex spectrogram enhancement by convolutional neural network with multi-metrics learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168119/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416201","htmlLink":"/document/8168119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex spectrogram enhancement by convolutional neural network with multi-metrics learning","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090119S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168120,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Wei Tsou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Wei","lastName":"Tsou","id":"37086308910"},{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Tzung","lastName":"Chien","id":"37269128300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168120","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Speech enhancement","Speech","Recurrent neural networks","Logic gates","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","source separation","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility","Turing machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","RNN","single-channel source separation","internal memory","external memory","neural Turing machine","short-term objective intelligibility measure","long short-term memory","memory augmented neural network","temporal information","speech enhancement","speech sequential signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long short-term memory","memory augmented neural network","monaural source separation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168120","abstract":"Recurrent neural network (RNN) based on long short-term memory (LSTM) has been successfully developed for single-channel source separation. Temporal information is learned by using dynamic states which are evolved through time and stored as an internal memory. The performance of source separation is constrained due to the limitation of internal memory which could not sufficiently preserve long-term characteristics from different sources. This study deals with this limitation by incorporating an external memory in RNN and accordingly presents a memory augmented neural network for source separation. In particular, we carry out a neural Turing machine to learn a separation model for sequential signals of speech and noise in presence of different speakers and noise types. Experiments show that speech enhancement based on memory augmented neural network consistently outperforms that using deep neural network and LSTM in terms of short-term objective intelligibility measure.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168120","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168120.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory augmented neural network for source separation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Memory augmented neural network for source separation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168120/","accessionNumber":"17416146","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory augmented neural network for source separation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063494S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8168133,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Vilamala","affiliation":["Technical University of Denmark"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Vilamala","id":"37601786300"},{"name":"Kristoffer H.

We present visually more compelling synthetic images of birds and flowers generated from text descriptions in comparison to some of the most prominent existing work.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168140","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial nets with perceptual losses for text-to-image synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168140/","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial nets with perceptual losses for text-to-image synthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416188","htmlLink":"/document/8168140/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial nets with perceptual losses for text-to-image synthesis","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074267S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168144,"authors":[{"name":"Tim O'Shea","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"O'Shea","id":"37085423235"},{"name":"Kiran Karra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Karra","id":"37086122487"},{"name":"T.

We compare performance in various wireless operating conditions and consider the trade offs between the two different classes of systems.

This problem is tackled through localized and small-size Bayesian networks (BNs), which are utilized to capture the spatio-temporal relationships underpinning traffic data from nearby road links. A dedicated BN is set up, trained, and tested for each road in the monitored geographical map. The joint probability distribution between the cause nodes and the effect node in the BN is tracked through a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whose parameters are estimated via Bayesian Variational Inference (BVI). Forecasting and anomaly detection are performed on statistical measures derived at runtime by the trained GMMs. Our design choices lead to several advantages: the approach is scalable as a small-size BN is associated with and independently trained for each road and the localized nature of the framework allows flagging atypical behaviors at their point of origin in the monitored geographical map. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is tested using a large dataset from a real network deployment, comparing its prediction performance with that of selected regression algorithms from the literature, while also quantifying its anomaly detection capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168151","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian forecasting and anomaly detection framework for vehicular monitoring networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian forecasting and anomaly detection framework for vehicular monitoring networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168151/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17398314","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian forecasting and anomaly detection framework for vehicular monitoring networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058849S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168152,"authors":[{"name":"Morten Kolb\u00e6k","affiliation":["Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, DK"],"firstName":"Morten","lastName":"Kolb\u00e6k","id":"37086019520"},{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab, Bellevue WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Zheng-Hua Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Zheng-Hua","lastName":"Tan","id":"37278529100"},{"name":"Jesper Jensen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37271733000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168152","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Noise reduction","Noise measurement","Machine learning","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uPIT","single-channel speaker independent multitalker speech separation","multiple noisy conditions","real-life noise signals","deep bi-directional LSTM RNNs","Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility measure","denoising task","Signal-to-Noise Ratios","multiple noise types","two-speaker","three-speaker noisy mixtures","deep bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks","utterance-level Permutation Invariant Training","noisy multitalker speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permutation Invariant Training","Speech Separation","Speech Denoising","Cocktail Party Problem","Deep Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168152","abstract":"In this paper we propose to use utterance-level Permutation Invariant Training (uPIT) for speaker independent multi-talker speech separation and denoising, simultaneously.

We focus our experiments on generalizability and noise robustness of models that rely on various types of a priori knowledge e.g. in terms of noise type and number of simultaneous speakers. We show that deep bi-directional LSTM RNNs trained using uPIT in noisy environments can improve the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) as well as the Extended Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (ESTOI) measure, on the speaker independent multi-talker speech separation and denoising task, for various noise types and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Specifically, we first show that LSTM RNNs can achieve large SDR and ESTOI improvements, when evaluated using known noise types, and that a single model is capable of handling multiple noise types with only a slight decrease in performance. Furthermore, we show that a single LSTM RNN can handle both two-speaker and three-speaker noisy mixtures, without a priori knowledge about the exact number of speakers. Finally, we show that LSTM RNNs trained using uPIT generalize well to noise types not seen during training.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168152","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168152.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint separation and denoising of noisy multi-talker speech using recurrent neural networks and permutation invariant training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint separation and denoising of noisy multi-talker speech using recurrent neural networks and permutation invariant training","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17416184","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168152/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint separation and denoising of noisy multi-talker speech using recurrent neural networks and permutation invariant training","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088985S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8168155,"authors":[{"name":"Asim Munawar","affiliation":["IBM Research - Tokyo"],"firstName":"Asim","lastName":"Munawar","id":"37281612500"},{"name":"Phongtharin Vinayavekhin","affiliation":["IBM Research - Tokyo"],"firstName":"Phongtharin","lastName":"Vinayavekhin","id":"37590224900"},{"name":"Giovanni De Magistris","affiliation":["IBM Research - Tokyo"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"De Magistris","id":"37085632127"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168155","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Anomaly detection","Training","Mathematical model","Training data","Noise reduction","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","image reconstruction","neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generative neural network","negative learning","generative models","unsupervised learning","training methods","generative capability","gradient direction","obstacle detection problem","MNIST handwritten digit dataset","reconstruction capability","learning technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168155","abstract":"Generative models are widely used for unsupervised learning with various applications, including data compression and signal restoration.

A less researched type of techniques concerns generation of only a single type of input. This is useful for applications such as constraint handling, noise reduction and anomaly detection. In this paper we present a technique to limit the generative capability of the network using negative learning. The proposed method searches the solution in the gradient direction for the desired input and in the opposite direction for the undesired input. One of the application can be anomaly detection where the undesired inputs are the anomalous data. We demonstrate the features of the algorithm using MNIST handwritten digit dataset and latter apply the technique to a real-world obstacle detection problem.

Monitoring based on sub-Nyquist sampling requires two sub-systems: a sub-system on-site for sampling machinery sounds at a low rate and a sub-system off-site for detecting anomalies from the subsampled signal. This paper proposes a method for achieving both subsystems. First, the proposed method uses non-uniform sampling to encode higher than the Nyquist frequency. Second, the method applies a long short-term memory-(LSTM)-based autoencoder network for detecting anomalies. The novelty of the proposed network is that the subsampled time-domain signal is demultiplexed and received as input in an end-to-end manner, enabling anomaly detection from the subsampled signal. Experimental results indicate that our method is suitable for anomaly detection from the subsampled signal.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168164.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How can we detect anomalies from subsampled audio signals?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How can we detect anomalies from subsampled audio signals?","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168164/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416175","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168164/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How can we detect anomalies from subsampled audio signals?","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100522S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168167,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Golbabaee","affiliation":["Institute for digital communications, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Golbabaee","id":"38073367100"},{"name":"Zhouye Chen","affiliation":["Institute of sensors, Heriot-Watt University, UK"],"firstName":"Zhouye","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086330773"},{"name":"Yves Wiaux","affiliation":["Institute of sensors, Heriot-Watt University, UK"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Wiaux","id":"37945597500"},{"name":"Mike E.

When a robot interacts with a human using speech signals, the robot inputs not only audio signals recorded by its own microphone but also speech signals made by the robot itself, which can be used for semi-blind speech enhancement. The SB-RNN consists of cascaded two modules: a semi-blind source separation module and a blind dereverberation module. Each module has a recurrent layer to capture the temporal correlations of speech signals. The SB-RNN is trained in a manner of multi-task learning, i.e., isolated echoic speech signals are used as teacher signals for the output of the separation module in addition to isolated unechoic signals for the output of the dereverberation module. Experimental results showed that the source to distortion ratio was improved by 2.30 dB on average compared to a conventional method based on a semi-blind independent component analysis. The results also showed the effectiveness of modularization of the network, multi-task learning, the recurrent structure, and semi-blind source separation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168191/","accessionNumber":"17416192","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168191/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind speech enhancement basedon recurrent neural network for source separation and dereverberation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind speech enhancement basedon recurrent neural network for source separation and dereverberation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074277S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8168192,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Xue Wen","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shi-Xue","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086331076"},{"name":"Jun Du","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Du","id":"37649186400"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168192","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech enhancement","Noise measurement","Training","Microstructure","Neural networks","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixing noise signals","basis functions","speech enhancement models","noisy speech features","clean speech features","DNN","microstructure noise bases","synthesized noise bases","real-world noise signals","deep neural network","noise generation","nonlinear mapping functions","noise generalization capability","noisy speech samples","noise signal segment","learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech enhancement","deep neural network","noise generalization","noise basis","objective performance measures"]}],"abstract":"We first examine the generalization issue with the noise samples used in training nonlinear mapping functions between noisy and clean speech features for deep neural network (DNN) based speech enhancement. Then an empirical proof is established to explain why the DNN-based approach has a good noise generalization capability provided that a large collection of noise types are included in generating diverse noisy speech samples for training. It is shown that an arbitrary noise signal segment can be well represented by a linear combination of microstructure noise bases. Accordingly, we propose to generate these mixing noise signals by designing a set of compact and analytic noise bases without using any realistic noise types. The experiments demonstrate that this noise generation scheme can yield comparable performance to that using 50 real noise types. Furthermore, by supplementing the collected noise types with the synthesized noise bases, we observe remarkable performance improvements implying that not only a large collection of real-world noise signals can be alleviated, but also a good noise generalization capability can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168192","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8122073/8168099/08168192.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On generating mixing noise signals with basis functions for simulating noisy speech and learning dnn-based speech enhancement models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168192/","displayDocTitle":"On generating mixing noise signals with basis functions for simulating noisy speech and learning dnn-based speech enhancement models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168192/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416196","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On generating mixing noise signals with basis functions for simulating noisy speech and learning dnn-based speech enhancement models","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"final94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085122S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8122073","isNumber":"8168099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8122073","xplore-issue":"8168099","articleId":"8168192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168193,"authors":[{"name":"Alison O'Shea","affiliation":["University College Cork, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research"],"firstName":"Alison","lastName":"O'Shea","id":"37086296772"},{"name":"Gordon Lightbody","affiliation":["University College Cork, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Lightbody","id":"37354061800"},{"name":"Geraldine Boylan","affiliation":["University College Cork, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research"],"firstName":"Geraldine","lastName":"Boylan","id":"37415962200"},{"name":"Andriy Temko","affiliation":["University College Cork, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research"],"firstName":"Andriy","lastName":"Temko","id":"37424805500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6341-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6342-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Pediatrics","Support vector machines","Convolution","Time-frequency analysis","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","electroencephalography","feature extraction","filtering theory","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neural nets","optimisation","paediatrics","signal classification","signal representation","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["raw EEG data","fully convolutional deep neural networks","neonatal seizure detection","deep neural network","feature extractor","classifier","end-to-end optimization","continuous unedited multichannel neonatal EEG","deep architecture","fully convolutional architecture","convolutional neural networks","end-to-end architecture","hierarchical representations","EEG waveforms","sample-level filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neonatal seizure detection","convolutional neural networks","support vector machine","EEG waveforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168193","abstract":"This study presents a novel end-to-end architecture that learns hierarchical representations from raw EEG data using fully convolutional deep neural networks for the task of neonatal seizure detection.

The signals also exhibit high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem due to the infinitesimal amplitude component distributed above the mean of the Rayleigh distribution plot. Since the amplitudes are nonlinearly and nonmonotonically increasing, applying roots to the amplitude distribution is shown in this paper to change the probability density function (PDF) and thus reduces the PAPR. We exemplify these by imposing this constraint on standard\u03bc-law companding (MC) technique in reducing PAPR of OFDM signals, which is known to expand the amplitudes of low power signals only without impacting the higher amplitude signals. This limits the PAPR reduction performance of the MC scheme. Since companding involves simultaneously compressing/expanding high/low amplitude OFDM signals, respectively, in this paper, we refer to the new method as a root-based MC (RMC) scheme that simultaneously expands and compresses OFDM signal amplitudes unlike MC. In addition, we express a second transform independent of the MC model. The results of the two proposed schemes outperform four other widely used companding techniques [MC, log-based modified (LMC), hyperbolic arc-sine companding (HASC) and exponential companding (EC)]. Besides these, we precode the OFDM signals using discrete Hartley transform (DHT) in order to further reduce the PAPR limits achieved by RMC by distorting the phase. While preserving the BER, DHT-precoded RMC outperforms all the four other companding schemes (MC, EC, HASC, LMC) in terms of PAPR.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08168244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"4618","endPage":"4629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Root-Based Nonlinear Companding Technique for Reducing PAPR of Precoded OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Root-Based Nonlinear Companding Technique for Reducing PAPR of Precoded OFDM Signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612563","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168244/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Root-Based Nonlinear Companding Technique for Reducing PAPR of Precoded OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"access-anoh-2779448-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109154S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8168244","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168247,"authors":[{"name":"Hongping Gan","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Integrated Services Networks, School of Communication Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8168247/gan-2780323-small.gif","p":["Hongping Gan received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Chongqing University of Arts and Science in 2011 and the M.S. degree from Sichuan University in 2014.

We prove that the BCsM meets the restricted isometry property with overwhelming probability, which guarantees good sensing performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art sensing matrices, such as the Gaussian sensing matrix, the BCsM has low complexity and is easily implemented in hardware.

The simulation results confirm that GMI is an efficient and accurate tool to compare their post-FEC performance. In particular for uniformly geometric-shaped constellation, the pre-FEC Q-factor is highly correlated with GMI though the correlation is reduced at lower FEC coding rate. Furthermore, GMI can be used to design optimized constellation together with generalized pairwise optimization algorithm to mitigate the GMI loss in non-Gray-mapped constellation. The GMI-optimized 32QAM (opt32) shows ~0.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement between 3 and 4 b/s GMI in both simulated and experimental results. Optimized two-dimensional 8 QAM is also designed to show the consistent GMI improvement over multi-dimensional 8 QAM-equivalent formats. In simulations, PS-64 QAM outperforms opt32 when a long sequence block is used in the distribution matcher.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8290594/08168248.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"423","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2779753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2779753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Comparison of Advanced Modulation Formats Based on Generalized Mutual Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Forward error correction","Entropy","Encoding","Parity check codes","Mutual information","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","optimisation","Q-factor","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced modulation formats","generalized mutual information","multidimensional constellation","geometric-shaped constellation","pre-FEC Q-factor","generalized pairwise optimization algorithm","GMI-optimized 32QAM","signal-to-noise ratio improvement","probabilistic-shaped constellation","PS constellation","forward error correction coding schemes","FEC coding rate","nonGray-mapped constellation","multidimensional 8 QAM-equivalent formats","consistent GMI improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized mutual information","geometric shaping","optimized constellation","pairwise optimization","probabilistic shaping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and Comparison of Advanced Modulation Formats Based on Generalized Mutual Information","volume":"36","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8168248/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17595721","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Comparison of Advanced Modulation Formats Based on Generalized Mutual Information","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2779753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067841S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8290594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8290594","articleId":"8168248","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168250,"authors":[{"name":"Kimchai Yeow","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology and Center for Mobile Cloud Computing Research, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8168250/yeow-2779263-small.gif","p":["Kimchai Yeow received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from NUS, Singapore; the master\u2019s degree in IT from UNITAR; and the DBA degree from UUM, Malaysia.

In contrast, legacy cloud-centric platforms offer deteriorated bandwidth and connectivity that affect the quality of service. Edge-centric Internet of Things-based technologies, such as fog and mist computing, offer distributed and decentralized solutions to resolve the drawbacks of cloud-centric models. However, to foster distributed edge-centric models, a decentralized consensus system is necessary to incentivize all participants to share their edge resources. This paper is motivated by the shortage of comprehensive reviews on decentralized consensus systems for edge-centric Internet of Things that elucidates myriad of consensus facets, such as data structure, scalable consensus ledgers, and transaction models. Decentralized consensus systems adopt either blockchain or blockchainless directed acyclic graph technologies, which serve as immutable public ledgers for transactions. This paper scrutinizes the pros and cons of state-of-the-art decentralized consensus systems. With an extensive literature review and categorization based on existing decentralized consensus systems, we propose a thematic taxonomy. The pivotal features and characteristics associated with existing decentralized consensus systems are analyzed via a comprehensive qualitative investigation.

It is important, both in theory and practical application, to do research on the modeling and state estimation of batteries, which is essential to optimizing energy management, extending the life cycle, reducing cost, and safeguarding the safe application of batteries in EVs. However, the batteries, with strong time-variables and nonlinear characteristics, are further influenced by such random factors such as driving loads, operational conditions, in the application of EVs. The real-time, accurate estimation of their state is challenging. The classification of the estimation methodologies for estimating state-of-charge (SoC) of battery focusing with the estimation method/algorithm, advantages, drawbacks, and estimation error are systematically and separately discussed. Especially for the battery packs existing of the inevitable inconsistency in cell capacity, resistance and voltage, the advanced characterizing monomer selection, and bias correction-based method has been described and discussed. The review also presents the key feedback factors that are indispensable for accurate estimation of battery SoC, it will be helpful for ensuring the SoC estimation accuracy. It will be very helpful for choosing an appropriate method to develop a reliable and safe battery management system and energy management strategy of the EVs. Finally, the paper also highlights a number of key factors and challenges, and presents the possible recommendations for the development of next generation of smart SoC estimation and battery management systems for electric vehicles and battery energy storage system.","topic":"Battery Energy Storage and Management Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"17573765","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168251/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Critical Review on the Battery State of Charge Estimation Methods for Electric Vehicles","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51507012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z171100001117063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Critical Review on the Battery State of Charge Estimation Methods for Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"access-xiong-2780258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181546S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Battery Energy Storage and Management Systems"],"articleId":"8168251","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168252,"authors":[{"name":"Liqing Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8168252/liu-2780236-small.gif","p":["Liqing Liu received the master\u2019s degree from the College of Science, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2015, where he is currently pursing the Ph.D. degree at the College of Information Science and Engineering.","Her current research interests include cloud computing and mobile computing."]},"firstName":"Liqing","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-6042-7204","id":"37086049176"},{"name":"Zheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8168252/chang-2780236-small.gif","p":["Zheng Chang (GS\u201910\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.Eng. degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2007, the M.Sc.

In the fog computing system, the mobile devices (MDs) can offload its data or computational expensive tasks to the fog node within its proximity, instead of distant cloud. Although offloading can reduce energy consumption at the MDs, it may also incur a larger execution delay including transmission time between the MDs and the fog/cloud servers, and waiting and execution time at the servers. Therefore, how to balance the energy consumption and delay performance is of research importance. Moreover, based on the energy consumption and delay, how to design a cost model for the MDs to enjoy the fog and cloud services is also important. In this paper, we utilize queuing theory to bring a thorough study on the energy consumption, execution delay, and payment cost of offloading processes in a fog computing system. Specifically, three queuing models are applied, respectively, to the MD, fog, and cloud centers, and the data rate and power consumption of the wireless link are explicitly considered. Based on the theoretical analysis, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated with a joint objective to minimize the energy consumption, execution delay, and payment cost by finding the optimal offloading probability and transmit power for each MD. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the superior performance over several existed schemes are observed.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780236","startPage":"283","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8288638/08168252.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Computation Offloading in Fog Computing","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8288638/8168252-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Computation Offloading in Fog Computing","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577606","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168252/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"284748"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Hebei NSF","grantNumber":"F2016203383 and E2017203351"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1702957"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007579","fundingName":"Wireless Engineering Research and Education Center at Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Multiobjective Optimization for Computation Offloading in Fog Computing","sourcePdf":"jiot-chang-2780236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081874S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8288638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"8288638","articleId":"8168252","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168253,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8168253/zhao-2780520-small.gif","p":["Feifei Zhao is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in military communication with the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Hence, how to efficiently combat interference while furthest guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) becomes an open question. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a joint admission control and a resource allocation strategy for an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based femtocell network. Particularly, we consider the scenario, where users are classified into two types, of which high priority ones have priority to access the network and enjoy high-resolution video streams. To perfectly eliminate the colayer interference with limited spectrum while maximizing the number of users whose QoS requirements can be guaranteed, we formulate an integer nonlinear programming problem, followed by a graph-based algorithm with polynomial computational complexity to solve it. The basic principle behind the proposed algorithm is to first chordalize the given conflict graph, and then perform admission control with priority differentiation-based admission control sub-algorithm, followed by the final resource block assignment with maximum effect rank allocation sub-algorithm. Furthermore, we illustrate how our proposal could be implemented in the long-term evolution system. Finally, through extensive simulations, we show that our proposal outperforms other two schemes in terms of guaranteeing QoS requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08168253.pdf","startPage":"1870","endPage":"1881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Graph-Based QoS-Aware Resource Management Scheme for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168253/","displayDocTitle":"A Graph-Based QoS-Aware Resource Management Scheme for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573766","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168253/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0802400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373171"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Graph-Based QoS-Aware Resource Management Scheme for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2780520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079606S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8168253","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168273,"authors":[{"name":"Deborah Cohen","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/8375152/8168273/cohen-2780599-small.gif","p":["Deborah Cohen (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree (summa\n cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the\n Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2010 and 2016, respectively.","Since 2010, she has been a Project Supervisor with the Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, the High Speed\n Digital Systems Laboratory, the Communications Laboratory, and the Signal Acquisition, Modeling and Processing Lab,\n Electrical Engineering Department, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology.

Adopting the tool of stochastic geometry, we analyze the coverage probability under the quantized zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). This analysis, however, intricate as a typical UE in a given cell experiences: i) a residual inter-user interference (IUI) rendered by the quantization error; ii) quantization-driven statistical correlation between its attending signal power and IUI; iii) Nakagami-type fading environment, induced by postprocessing ZFBF; and iv) intercell interference (ICI). Current related literature has not effectively accounted for issues (i), (ii), and (iv) and commonly resorted to simplifying scenarios of full SDMA (i.e., exponential fading), independency of IUI and attending signal power, approximating IUI via an exponential random variable, and the quantization cell approximation (QCA). Our analysis relaxes such limiting assumptions; it includes the more relevant random vector quantization (RVQ) method, and compared to the literature, does not resort to the evaluation of a higher order differentiation for the evaluation of the coverage probability by exploiting our previously developed method. We further introduce three novel approximations of the coverage probability: RVQ-M, RVG-G, and QCA, which the first two approximations are given in semi-closed-form formulas (requiring a simple integration step) and the last approximation is in a closed-form expression. All approximations are numerically affordable, and we confirm the RVG-G approximation is the most accurate one.

At a receiver, successive interference cancellation is carried out across layers to remove the signals that are already decoded. A closed-form expression for the total throughput is derived under certain assumptions. It is shown that the transmission rates of layers can be optimized to maximize the total throughput and the proposed scheme can improve the throughput with multiple layers. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal rates can be recursively found using multiple individual 1-D optimizations. We also modify the proposed layered random access scheme with contention resolution repetition diversity for reliable transmissions with a delay constraint. It is shown to be possible to have a low outage probability if the number of copies can be optimized, which is desirable for high reliability low latency communications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8318336/08168277.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Non-Orthogonal Random Access With SIC and Transmit Diversity for Reliable Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Layered Non-Orthogonal Random Access With SIC and Transmit Diversity for Reliable Transmissions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168277/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17617363","htmlLink":"/document/8168277/","volume":"66","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002582","fundingName":"\u201cClimate Technology Development and Application\u201d research project (K07732) through a grant provided by GIST in 2017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Non-Orthogonal Random Access With SIC and Transmit Diversity for Reliable Transmissions","sourcePdf":"tcomm-choi-2780235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198678S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8318336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8318336","articleId":"8168277","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168278,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7274860/8662261/8168278/li-2780320-small.gif","p":["Jianxin Li received the PhD degree in January 2008.

Many distributed graph processing systems [19], [22], [23] adopt a vertex-centric programming paradigm. In these systems, messages are passed between vertices to propagate the latest states. The communication efficiency and the high overhead of synchronization are two key considerations of these systems [8], [12]. In this paper, we propose a Slow Passing Fast Consuming (SPFC) approach which can effectively improve the overall performance of vertex-centric graph processing systems. In our approach, the message passing is slow but the consuming is fast. More specifically, at the message sender side, priority is given to those smart messages which contribute more to the algorithm convergence, and at the message receiver side, messages are consumed right after arriving without any delay and intermediate buffer. Besides, by using a two-phase termination check protocol, the global synchronous barrier can be completely eliminated. In addition, based on the slow message passing strategy, further performance improvement can be achieved with some accuracy loss by eliminating those messages which are less useful for algorithm convergence. We implement our approach based on Apache Giraph [1] and evaluate it on a 12-machine cluster. The experimental results show that our method can effectively reduce the amount of message traffic and achieve up to an order of magnitude performance improvement compared with Giraph and GraphLab [3].","doi":"10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2780320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274860/8662261/08168278.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8662261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2780320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPFC: An Effective Optimization for Vertex-Centric Graph Processing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"SPFC: An Effective Optimization for Vertex-Centric Graph Processing Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168278/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18509025","htmlLink":"/document/8168278/","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472022, 61421003 and SKLSDE-2016ZX-11"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPFC: An Effective Optimization for Vertex-Centric Graph Processing Systems","sourcePdf":"tsusc-li-2780320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155458S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7274860","isNumber":"8662261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274860","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8662261","articleId":"8168278","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8168325,"authors":[{"name":"Loai Danial","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/8330765/8168325/dania-2780251-small.gif","p":["Loai Danial received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

The proposed technique is demonstrated on an adaptive and self-calibrated binary-weighted DAC that can be configured on-chip in real time. We design a reconfigurable 4-bit DAC with a memristor-based neural network. This circuit uses an online supervised machine learning algorithm called \u201cbinary-weighted time-varying gradient descent.\u201d This algorithm fits multiple full-scale voltage ranges and sampling frequencies by iterative synaptic adjustments, while inherently providing mismatch calibration and noise tolerance. Theoretical analysis, as well as simulation results, show the efficiency and robustness of the training algorithm in reconfiguration, self-calibration, and desensitization, leading to a significant improvement in DAC accuracy: 0.12 LSB in terms of integral non-linearity, 0.11 LSB in terms of differential non-linearity, and 3.63 bits in terms of effective number of bits.

Previous Al/PCMO devices exhibited degraded LRS retention due to the low activation energy for oxidation of the Al electrode, and Mo/PCMO devices showed low conductance contrast. To control the redox reaction at the metal/PCMO interface, we introduce a 4-nm interfacial layer of conducting MoOx as an oxygen buffer layer. Due to the controlled redox reaction within this Al/Mo/PCMO device, we observed improvements in both retention and conductance on/off ratio. We confirm bidirectional analog synapse characteristics and measure \u201cjump-tables\u201d suitable for large scale neural network simulations that attempt to capture complex and stochastic device behavior [see companion paper]. Finally, switching energy measurements are shown, illustrating a path for future device research toward smaller devices, shorter pulses and lower programming voltages.","doi":"10.1109/JEDS.2017.2780275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245494/8232486/08168326.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEDS.2017.2780275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional Non-Filamentary RRAM as an Analog Neuromorphic Synapse, Part I: Al/Mo/Pr<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> Material Improvements and Device Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional Non-Filamentary RRAM as an Analog Neuromorphic Synapse, Part I: Al/Mo/Pr<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> Material Improvements and Device Measurements","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168326/","accessionNumber":"17454679","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"PIONEER Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"2012-0009460"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Bidirectional Non-Filamentary RRAM as an Analog Neuromorphic Synapse, Part I: Al/Mo/Pr<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> Material Improvements and Device Measurements","sourcePdf":"jeds-burr-2780275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066843S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245494","isNumber":"8232486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245494","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8232486","articleId":"8168326","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168328,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Wazid","affiliation":["Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8168328/wazid-2780232-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Wazid (S\u201917) received the M.Tech. degree in computer network engineering from Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India.","He has authored or co-authored over 50 papers in international journals and conferences.

The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes, such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes, and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy. In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity, and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes. In addition, UAKMP is also comparable in computation and communication costs as compared to other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8288638/08168328.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Secure User Authenticated Key Management Protocol for Generic IoT Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of Secure User Authenticated Key Management Protocol for Generic IoT Networks","volume":"5","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168328/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17577607","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of the Korean Government","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1B03932149"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Secure User Authenticated Key Management Protocol for Generic IoT Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-jo-2780232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8288638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"8288638","articleId":"8168328","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168332,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Alnoman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8362823/8168332/alnom-2780238-small.gif","p":["Ali Alnoman received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Baghdad, Iraq, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

The problems related to battery technology can be addressed by dynamically charging the EV while on the move. In-motion charging can reduce the battery storage requirement, which could significantly extend the driving range of an EV.

Simplicity is inherent in the gradient approach itself-The negative of the gradient of a given cost function gives an indication of the change to make to a sequence to find the local minimum of the cost function. Flexibility is provided by the lack of constraints on the cost function, allowing different aspects of a sequence to be optimized, e.g., autocorrelation or cross-correlation sidelobe energy, or spectral characteristics. Additional flexibility is provided by the linearity of gradients. The gradient of a linear combination of cost functions is simply an equivalent linear combination of their gradients. This allows multiple objectives to be optimized simultaneously. Gradient computational complexity has been one impediment to the use of gradient descent in sequence design in the past. In this paper, it is shown that gradients for a large variety of cost functions can be computed very efficiently. For a sequence of length N, the computational complexity of computing the full gradient (the gradient with respect to all N elements) is O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) in a \u201cnaive\u201d implementation. In this paper, equations are derived that allow the gradients to be computed with O(N log N) operations, a substantial improvement over previous methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839945","htmlLink":"/document/8168352/","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Sequence Design via Gradient Descent Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Sequence Design via Gradient Descent Methods","sourcePdf":"taes-baden-2780538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097659S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8375152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8375152","articleId":"8168352","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168355,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanjie Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Railway Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8168355/wang-2780218-small.gif","p":["Yuanjie Wang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2010.

The results give interesting insights into the effect of the power control in both the uplink and downlink. Detailed simulations show that the approximations made in the analysis are well justified.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08168355.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Meta Distribution of the SIR for Cellular Networks With Power Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168355","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8338165/8168355-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"The Meta Distribution of the SIR for Cellular Networks With Power Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168355/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17699084","htmlLink":"/document/8168355/","volume":"66","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471030"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2015ZX03001027-003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 1525904"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"The Meta Distribution of the SIR for Cellular Networks With Power Control","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2780218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117776S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8168355","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168357,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8168357/zhang-2779432-small.gif","p":["Dongdong Zhang (M\u201917) was born in Jining, China, in 1990.

There are two main difficulties associated with analyzing the iron loss of induction motors, i.e., the identification of rotor flux density harmonics and the accurate prediction of iron loss. In order to reveal the iron loss characteristics of the inverter-fed induction motors, especially on the rotor side, a computationally efficient rotor flux density harmonics identification method using data from a single power supply fundamental frequency cycle (supply cycle) is proposed. With the proposed identification method, the rotor iron loss characteristics of a 5.5- and a 30-kW inverter-fed induction motors are investigated. By comparing the predicted and measured iron losses of those induction motors under both sinusoidal and PWM inverter voltage supplies, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated. Furthermore, the detailed iron loss characteristics of the two induction machines under both sinusoidal and PWM inverter voltage supplies are studied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Identification Method for Rotor Flux Density Harmonics and Resulting Rotor Iron Losses of Inverter-Fed Induction Motors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2779432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08168357.pdf","startPage":"5384","endPage":"5394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2779432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Identification Method for Rotor Flux Density Harmonics and Resulting Rotor Iron Losses of Inverter-Fed Induction Motors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8168357/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630192","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Identification Method for Rotor Flux Density Harmonics and Resulting Rotor Iron Losses of Inverter-Fed Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2779432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105987S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8168357","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8168361,"authors":[{"name":"Houshou Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Houshou","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2929-3882","id":"37281179500"},{"name":"Kuo-Chen Chung","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Kuo-Chen","lastName":"Chung","id":"37086282445"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8168361","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction of OFDM signals by executing partial transmit sequence (PTS) in minimal trellis of block codes.

While the GPU has been effective for many learning tasks, still many GPU learning applications have low execution efficiency due to sparse data. Sparse data induces divergent memory accesses with low locality, thereby consuming a large fraction of execution time transferring data across the memory hierarchy. Although a considerable effort has been devoted to reducing the memory divergence, iterative-convergent learning provides a unique opportunity to achieve full potential in modern GPUs that it allows different threads to continue computation using stale values. In this paper, we propose StaleLearn, a learning acceleration mechanism to reduce the memory divergence overhead of GPU learning by utilizing the stale value tolerance of the iterative-convergent learning. Based on the stale value tolerance, StaleLearn transforms the problem of divergent memory accesses into the synchronization problem by replicating the model and reduces the synchronization overhead by asynchronous synchronization on Processor-in-Memory (PIM). The stale value tolerance enables a clear task decomposition between the GPU and PIM, which can effectively exploit parallelism between PIM and GPU. On average, our approach accelerates representative GPU learning applications by 3.17 times with existing PIM proposals.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/12/8356015/8168367-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2018","volume":"67","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17768039","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2018","publicationDate":"1 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168367/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"StaleLearn: Learning Acceleration with Asynchronous Synchronization Between Model Replicas on PIM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"XPS-1337177, XPS-1533767 and CCF-1054830"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"StaleLearn: Learning Acceleration with Asynchronous Synchronization Between Model Replicas on PIM","sourcePdf":"tc-lee-2780237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085085S","chronDate":"June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8356015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8356015","articleId":"8168367","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8168373,"authors":[{"name":"H.

First, the target's observation values in the range-slow time plane are extracted by a kind of polynomial Radon transform according to the preset motion parameters of the searching space. Then, the observation values are matched and integrated by polynomial Fourier transform, and the hypersonic maneuvering target with arbitrary parameterized motion can be detected in the PRPFT domain. To reduce the computational complexity, a multiresolution method is proposed to search multidimensional parameter space. Finally, its application is illustrated to analyze and compare the performance between the proposed approach and the existing approach. It is shown that moving target detection and Radon-Fourier transform are actually special cases of PRPFT. The proposed method can compensate the range walk and the Doppler migration simultaneously, the detection performance of hypersonic maneuvering weak target may be significantly improved via PRPFT in the low signal-noise ratio background. The proposed algorithm can be used in the form of the second-order polynomial model, and it can also be extended to higher order form.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8375152/08168376.pdf","startPage":"1306","endPage":"1322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2017.2780658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2780658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Radon-Polynomial Fourier Transform for Near Space Hypersonic Maneuvering Target Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Fourier transforms","Radon","Radar detection","Radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Doppler radar","filtering theory","Fourier transforms","object detection","polynomials","radar detection","radar signal processing","Radon transforms","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial Radon-polynomial Fourier transform","PRPFT","Doppler migration","strong maneuvering","observation values","range-slow time plane","searching space","multidimensional parameter space","Radon-Fourier","second-order polynomial model","near space hypersonic maneuvering target detection","coherent integration detection","radar signal processing approach","near space hypersonic maneuvering weak target","range unit range walk","preset motion parameters","arbitrary parameterized motion","computational complexity","multiresolution method","low signal-noise ratio background"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Across range unit (ARU)","coherent integration","Doppler migration","near space hypersonic target","polynomial radon polynomial Fourier transform (PRPFT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Radon-Polynomial Fourier Transform for Near Space Hypersonic Maneuvering Target Detection","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8168376/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839933","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61372027, 61501489 and 61671462"},{"fundingName":"Distinguished Taishan Scholars in Climbing Plan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Radon-Polynomial Fourier Transform for Near Space Hypersonic Maneuvering Target Detection","sourcePdf":"taes-wu-2780658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093474S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8375152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8375152","articleId":"8168376","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8168399,"authors":[{"name":"Nerea del-Rey-Maestre","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and CommunicationsSuperior Polytechnic SchoolUniversity of Alcal\u00e1"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8295180/8168399/meast-2780798-small.gif","p":["Nerea del-Rey-Maestre received the M.Eng. degree in telecommunication\n engineering from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain, in 2012.

The 6 dB back-off PAE is 25%, which is a 64% improvement compared to ideal class B PA back-off performance. High output power is obtained by employing four-stack multigate devices at the output stage; driver stages employ two-stack devices.

Optimization of Yagi\u2013Uda Antenna Applying Enhanced Firefly Algorithm With Adaptive Cost Function","abstract":"Due to high gain and low production costs, Yagi-Uda antennas still find wide applications in wireless communication systems. The sensitivity of the gain due to variations of the element lengths and distances between the elements makes the design optimization quite challenging. In this paper, the multi-objective optimization of a six-element Yagi-Uda antenna applying an enhanced version of the firefly algorithm is proposed. The application of this optimization algorithm in the multi-objective sense allows the finding of local solutions, too. To minimize the computational time, an adaptive cost function is applied. The numerical analyses are performed by the partial element equivalent circuit method and the mutual impedance method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isJournal":true,"externalId":"8000504","accessionNumber":"17596235","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8168407/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimization of Yagi\u2013Uda Antenna Applying Enhanced Firefly Algorithm With Adaptive Cost Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Optimization of Yagi\u2013Uda Antenna Applying Enhanced Firefly Algorithm With Adaptive Cost Function","sourcePdf":"tmag-baumgartner-2764319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049219S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8299599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8299599","articleId":"8168407","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8168410,"authors":[{"name":"Dingfei Guo","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-electronic Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/8246665/8168410/guo-2735663-small.gif","p":["Dingfei Guo received the B.Sc. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include the inertial technology and integrated navigation technology."]},"firstName":"Dingfei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37071130500"},{"name":"Maiying Zhong","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/8246665/8168410/zhong-2735663-small.gif","p":["Maiying Zhong received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1999.","From 2000 to 2001, she was a Research Fellow with Donghua University, Shanghai, China.

This paper focuses on developing an alternative approach to FD for airspeed sensor in UAVs by using data from gyros, accelerometers, global positioning system, and wind vanes. Based on the kinematics model of the UAV, an estimator is proposed to provide analytical redundancy using information from the above-mentioned sensors, which are commonly implemented on UAVs. This filter process is independent of the airspeed measurement and the aircraft dynamics model. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the airspeed kinematics is observable. The \u03c72 test and cumulative sum detector are employed to detect the occurrence of airspeed measurement faults together. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology has been evaluated through flight experiments of UAVs.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2017.2735663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation

As the record of the maximum speed of rail has been continuously broken and new applications are foreseen, the high-speed railway (HSR) communication system requires higher data rate with seamless connectivity, and therefore, the system design faces new challenges to support high mobility. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies are considered as candidates to provide wideband communication. However, mmWave is rarely explored in HSR scenarios. In this paper, channel characteristics are studied in the 5G mmWave band for typical HSR scenarios, including urban, rural, and tunnel, with straight and curved route shapes. Based on the wideband measurements conducted in the tunnel scenario by using the \u201cmobile hotspot network\u201d system, a 3-D ray tracer (RT) is calibrated and validated to explore more channel characteristics in different HSR scenarios. Through extensive RT simulations with 500-MHz bandwidth centered at 25.25 GHz, the power contributions of the multipath components are studied, and the dominant reflection orders are determined for each scenario. Path loss is analyzed, and the breakpoint is observed. Other key parameters, such as Doppler shifts, coherence time, polarization ratios, and so on, are studied. Suggestions on symbol rate, sub-frame bandwidth, and polarization configuration are provided to guide the 5G mmWave communication system design in typical HSR scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8478838/08168415.pdf","startPage":"3144","endPage":"3158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2771559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2771559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8478838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Measurement, Simulation, and Analysis for High-Speed Railway Communications in 5G Millimeter-Wave Band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rails","Rail transportation","5G mobile communication","Analytical models","Shape","Millimeter wave measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","broadband networks","cellular radio","millimetre wave communication","multipath channels","rail traffic","railway communication","ray tracing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel measurement","rail traffic","high-speed railway communication system","higher data rate","seamless connectivity","system design","high mobility","millimeter-wave technologies","wideband communication","channel characteristics","urban tunnel","wideband measurements","tunnel scenario","mobile hotspot network system","extensive RT simulations","rural tunnel","5G millimeter-wave band","channel simulation","HSR scenarios","frequency 25.25 GHz","bandwidth 500 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel measurement","high speed railway communication","intelligent transportation systems","MHN","millimeter wave","ray tracing simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Channel Measurement, Simulation, and Analysis for High-Speed Railway Communications in 5G Millimeter-Wave Band","volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8168415/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18145471","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion grant through the Korean Government (MSIT) (Development of 5G Mobile Communication Technologies for Hyper-Connected Smart Services)","grantNumber":"2014-0-00282"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Measurement, Simulation, and Analysis for High-Speed Railway Communications in 5G Millimeter-Wave Band","sourcePdf":"tits-he-2771559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114121S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8478838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8478838","articleId":"8168415","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168425,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8387923/8168425/wang-2780223-small.gif","p":["Ying Wang (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electric\n engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree,\n in 2014, from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

When providing ancillary services (e.g., regulation, reserve, etc.), the real-time (RT) deployment of ES is uncertain, and it is important to manage state of charge accordingly. Aiming to improve the ES performance for providing energy and regulation service in the electricity market, we propose two data-driven Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal models. The first one is a historical-data-driven AGC signal model, which is based on the analysis of the historical AGC signals, and is designed for ES participation in the day-ahead (DA) market. The second one is a prediction-data-driven AGC signal model, which is based on the prediction of the AGC signals, and is designed for ES participation in the RT market. We also develop a deployment availability check model and solution algorithm. The proposed framework is applied to an ES bidding problem in the DA and RT markets. The results indicate that deployment availability and operational performance of the ES are improved with the proposed data-driven AGC models compared to traditional benchmarks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic generation control","Power system stability","ISO","Uncertainty","Electronic mail","State of charge","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","power generation control","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Energy Storage","power system operations","ES performance","electricity market","Automatic Generation Control signal models","historical-data-driven AGC signal model","historical AGC signals","ES participation","day-ahead market","prediction-data-driven AGC signal model","RT market","deployment availability check model","ES bidding problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Storage","AGC signal model","deployment uncertainty","ancillary services market","regulation service"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2780223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8387923/08168425.pdf","startPage":"4207","endPage":"4217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2780223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Deployment Availability of Energy Storage With Data-Driven AGC Signal Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Deployment Availability of Energy Storage With Data-Driven AGC Signal Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168425/","volume":"33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8168425/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857621","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51477157, 51577031 and 51761135015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"State Grid Corporation of China (Dynamic Demand Response Control of Large-scale Diverse Demand Side Resources)"},{"fundingName":"Argonne National Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science laboratory","grantNumber":"DE AC02-06CH11357"},{"fundingName":"Hundred Talents Program of Zhejiang University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Deployment Availability of Energy Storage With Data-Driven AGC Signal Models","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-botterud-2780223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127752S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8387923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8387923","articleId":"8168425","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8168427,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Filip","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, We\u00dfling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/8375152/8168427/filip-2780678-small.gif","p":["Alexandra Filip received the Bachelor's and Master's\n degrees in electrical engineering from Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

It is particularly important for passive radar scenarios, where the signals of opportunity have not been originally designed for radar purposes. This paper focuses on studying the achievable resolution capabilities for a noncoherent orthogonal frequency division-multiplexing (OFDM)-based passive multistatic radar for L-band digital aeronautical communication system (LDACS) signals. For this purpose, the ambiguity function obtained when employing the OFDM-based LDACS communications signals as signals of opportunity is studied. A generic bistatic link is considered and closed-form expressions for the expectation of the corresponding ambiguity function when accounting for the different signal contributions are derived. The resulting expressions are then used to evaluate and analyze the overall multistatic radar ambiguity function for two sample radar scenarios. The results highlight the impact of the geometry on the shape of the ambiguity function, allowing therefore for a better understanding of the effect that the geometry has on the range and velocity resolution capabilities of the studied system.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2017.2780678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8375152/08168427.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2780678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ambiguity Function Analysis for OFDM-Based LDACS Passive Multistatic Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168427/","displayDocTitle":"Ambiguity Function Analysis for OFDM-Based LDACS Passive Multistatic Radar","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839962","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168427/","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ambiguity Function Analysis for OFDM-Based LDACS Passive Multistatic Radar","sourcePdf":"taes-filip-2780678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109604S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8375152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8375152","articleId":"8168427","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168448,"authors":[{"name":"P M Prihatini","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia"],"firstName":"P M","lastName":"Prihatini","id":"37087620676"},{"name":"Ikgd Putra","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ikgd","lastName":"Putra","id":"37085665532"},{"name":"Iad Giriantari","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Iad","lastName":"Giriantari","id":"37990984500"},{"name":"M Sudarma","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Sudarma","id":"37086286739"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6395-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168448","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Inference algorithms","Cognition","Resource management","Data mining","Measurement","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","inference mechanisms","sampling methods","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mean Variational Inference","reasoning method","latent Dirichlet allocation","Gibbs Sampling","feature extraction","Indonesian text"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature extraction","latent dirichlet allocation","gibbs sampling","mean variational inference","Indonesian text"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168448","abstract":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been developed as topic-based method which uses reasoning to determine the topics of a document.

Firstly, the EEG signal is calculated for its autocorrelation frequencies as the basic step in the bispectrum calculation. Then, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied substituting the FFT which usually is used in the bispectrum calculation. Lastly, the relative value of each frequency band is calculated for both the approximation and the details parts, producing the RWB. The proposed methodology is implemented in an alcoholic automated detection system using 1200 data samples from UCI EEG Database for alcoholism. Based on the experiments, the setting value of lag in the autocorrelation calculation was evidently very influential on the recognition rate obtained, i.e. the maximum value for the lag was the best. Using cross validation, the highest results from RWB feature extraction method with ANN classifier achieved about 90% recognition rate.","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168473","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on

speech recognition system to control the speed of a DC motor. The Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) method is used in the speed recognition system, tuned by the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) method. There are 5 (five) samples of voice signals in Bahasa Indonesia recognized by this system, i.e.: \u201cNyala\u201d, \u201cLambat\u201d, \u201cSedang\u201d, \u201cCepat\u201d and \u201cMati\u201d. Every voice signal is repeated 5 (five) times until as many as 25 samples are recorded. Their voice characteristics are extracted using the LPC method represented by the LPC coefficients stored in a database system. The ANFIS method is implemented in 50 iterations to tune and to train the LPC coefficients until the least error, i.e. 0,00012446 is obtained. Voice samples originated from the internal database system are 83% successfully recognized by this system. However; samples extracted from the human voice signals of different persons - different sex from the person whose voice signals are recorded in the database system, and from various ages - are only 78,8% successfully recognized by the system. The output of the speech recognition system is coded into the ASCII Codes and converted into the PWM signal to control the speed of a DC motor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DC motor speed control using the LPC-ANFIS speech recognition system","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168484","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121965/8168430/08168484.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QIR.2017.8168484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168430","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A DC motor speed control using the LPC-ANFIS speech recognition system","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168484/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17416037","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DC motor speed control using the LPC-ANFIS speech recognition system","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"E4C8883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077784S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121965","isNumber":"8168430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121965","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8168430","articleId":"8168484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168490,"authors":[{"name":"Misfa Susanto","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Misfa","lastName":"Susanto","id":"37070518800"},{"name":"Risdawati Hutabarat","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Risdawati","lastName":"Hutabarat","id":"37086324526"},{"name":"Yetti Yuniati","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Yetti","lastName":"Yuniati","id":"37086321659"},{"name":"Syaiful Alam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Syaiful","lastName":"Alam","id":"37086322701"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6395-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168490","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Power control","Interference","Uplink","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","power control","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference management","uplink transmission","femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","two-tier cellular networks","4G cellular network","power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference Management","Power Control","Cellular Communication Network","Multi-Cell Scenario","Femtocell","Two-Tier Cellular Network","Uplink Transmission","SINR"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell is a small cell of 10-30 meters radius deployed in the existing larger cell (macrocell) forming two-tier femtocell-macrocell cellular network. However, the deployment of femtocell into the existing macrocell cellular network is facing more complex interference problems. This paper focuses on interference management using power control methods for the uplink transmission of such two-tier cellular networks. Types of interferences considered in this paper are co-tier (femtocell-to-femtocell and macrocell-to-macrocell), cross-tier (femtocell-to-macrocell and macrocell-to-femtocell), and total interferences. This paper considers multi-cell scenario of cellular communication network consisting of three macrocell cellular networks in which each macrocell is deployed 10 femtocells. This paper analyzes one of three macrocells on the uplink transmission with the other two macrocells on downlink transmissions. All femtocells are on the same transmission conditions as its co-located macrocells. This paper observes one of ten uplink femtocells on the observed uplink macrocell. Through simulation, this paper firstly analyzes co-tier, cross-tier, and total interferences for the system without power control. The results of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) in term of its Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the system without power control are used as a baseline system. Then, this paper proposes the use of two power controls namely PC-1 and PC-2 in this paper which both power controls work based on the estimated current SINR. Both power control methods are also to make sure that the transmitting power of the users in the observed base stations (eNB/HeNB in 4G cellular network terminology) will not exceed maximum or minimum of its allowed transmitting power (uplink transmission case). The simulation has been carried out and the SINR results were collected and compared to baseline system. The simulation results show that PC-1 and PC-2 outperform the baseline system in terms of CDF of SINR.","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168490","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121965/8168430/08168490.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QIR.2017.8168490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Management using power control for uplink transmission in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168490/","displayDocTitle":"Interference Management using power control for uplink transmission in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17416008","htmlLink":"/document/8168490/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Management using power control for uplink transmission in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"E4D6370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053444S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121965","isNumber":"8168430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121965","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8168430","articleId":"8168490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168502,"authors":[{"name":"Bhakti Yudho Suprapto","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Bhakti Yudho","lastName":"Suprapto","id":"37085900232"},{"name":"Amsa Mustaqim","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Amsa","lastName":"Mustaqim","id":"37086321913"},{"name":"Wahidin Wahab","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Wahidin","lastName":"Wahab","id":"37393745000"},{"name":"Benyamin Kusumoputro","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Benyamin","lastName":"Kusumoputro","id":"37395032700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6395-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168502","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Training","Ink","Rotors","Neurons","Mathematical model","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace components","aircraft control","attitude control","autonomous aerial vehicles","feedback","helicopters","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","recurrent neural nets","rotors (mechanical)","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified Elman recurrent neural network","heavy-lift hexacopter","attitude control","altitude control","rotor-wing unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV","MERNN","self-feedback","gain coefficients","connection weight","time-varying system","nonlinear characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct Inverse Control","Elman Recurrent Neural Network","Heavy-lift Hexacopter","Modified Elman Recurrent Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168502","abstract":"Hexacopter is a member of rotor-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which has 6 six rotors with fixed pitch blades and nonlinear characteristics that cause controlling the attitude of hexacopter is difficult.

To provide an actual parameter of an antenna radiation, measurement must be performed in the far-field region and its distance is proportional to the antenna's dimension. Therefore, in a limited space of an anechoic chamber facility, antenna measurement has a constraint to a maximum dimension of the antenna under test. Near-field measurement method has been an alternative to overcome this problem. However, additional techniques, such as sampling, scanning mechanism, transformation computation, cannot be avoided to obtain the actual antenna radiation parameters. In this research, we study cylindrical scanning technique to obtain sampling data because it is simpler than the spherical scanning in mechanical setup and can produce radiation pattern results in completely two dimension polar diagrams. Our purpose is to provide low cost and reasonable performance of a near-field measurement system. Two dimension Fast-Fourier Transform is used to process and analyze the near-field data into the far-field data. Other methods, i.e. one dimensional Fast-Fourier transform and numerical method, are also performed to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Near-field data generated from experiment data measured of 8-array micro-strip antenna at resonant frequency 3.35 GHz. Transformation results show that average deviations of one dimension Fast-Fourier Transform, two dimension Fast-Fourier Transform and the numerical method are 6.83 dB, 3.04 dB, and 3.77 dB, respectively. These results show the minimum discrepancies between the transform and the expected far-field obtained by using the two dimensions Fast-Fourier Transform. This method has shown near-field measurement and transformation can predict the far-field radiation characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168513","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121965/8168430/08168513.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QIR.2017.8168513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-field to far-field transformation of cylindrical scanning antenna measurement using two dimension fast-fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168513/","displayDocTitle":"Near-field to far-field transformation of cylindrical scanning antenna measurement using two dimension fast-fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17415997","htmlLink":"/document/8168513/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field to far-field transformation of cylindrical scanning antenna measurement using two dimension fast-fourier transform","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"E6A5613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102882S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121965","isNumber":"8168430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121965","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8168430","articleId":"8168513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168530,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Hafid Paronda","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Universitas Indonesia, UI Depok, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Abdul Hafid","lastName":"Paronda","id":"37086330149"},{"name":"Muhamad Asvial","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Universitas Indonesia, UI Depok, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Muhamad","lastName":"Asvial","id":"37268708800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6395-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168530","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Power control","Interference","Energy efficiency","Femtocell networks","System performance","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","power control","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic uplink power control algorithm","lower fairness index","energy efficiency","spectral efficiency","heterogeneous small cell networks","uplink control","fractional power coefficient","uplink resource allocation algorithm","single carrier - frequency division multiple access","power constraint","fractional power control","power allocation","cellular network","cellular traffic demand","5G femtocell networks","FPC","SC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["uplink power control","fractional power coefficient","energy efficiency","femtocell network","5G technology"]}],"abstract":"The number of subscribers and cellular traffic demand had grown dramatically, which is an urgent challenge face on the cellular network and system performance. Due to the problem, power allocation was exploited by many researchers in order to improve the system performance, e.g. implementation of fractional power control (FPC) as the power constraint in single carrier - frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in term of uplink resource allocation algorithm and fractional power coefficient as the uplink control in heterogeneous small cell networks. Both of them could enhance any system performance i.e. spectral efficiency, transmission rate and energy efficiency. Even though any tradeoff would be the handicap in order to maintain the system's quality of service (QoS), such as the lower fairness index at the first one, worse outage probability and also significant interference at the second. In this paper, a dynamic uplink power control algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, especially to manage that tradeoff within user's velocity-based scenario (UVS). Beside to enhance the system performance improvement, the implementation of the proposed algorithm is also addressed as the way to investigate the 5G wireless technology, especially in a femtocell network. Numerical results as shown by this proposed indicate the obtained enhancement of the system i.e. improvement of the energy efficiency by 10%-99%.","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168530","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121965/8168430/08168530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QIR.2017.8168530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168430","startPage":"462","endPage":"467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User's velocity-based uplink power control in 5G femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User's velocity-based uplink power control in 5G femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168530/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17415983","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User's velocity-based uplink power control in 5G femtocell networks","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"E6D2758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098973S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121965","isNumber":"8168430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121965","xplore-issue":"8168430","articleId":"8168530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168533,"authors":[{"name":"Misfa Susanto","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Misfa","lastName":"Susanto","id":"37070518800"},{"name":"Dika Fauzia","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Dika","lastName":"Fauzia","id":"37086892793"},{"name":"Melvi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia"],"lastName":"Melvi","id":"37086890615"},{"name":"Syaiful Alam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Syaiful","lastName":"Alam","id":"37086322701"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6397-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6395-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6398-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168533","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Macrocell networks","Power control","Signal to noise ratio","Downlink","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","power control","quality of service","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink power control","interference management","femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","two-tier femtocell-macrocell cellular network","complicated interference problems","downlink transmission","two-tier cellular communication network","controlled transmitting power","allowable transmitting powers","licensed frequency spectrum","multicell cellular network","quality of service","QoS","signal to interference plus noise ratio","cumulative distribution function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular Communication Network","Femtocell","Two-Tier Cellular Network","Downlink Transmission","Interference Management","Power Control","Multi-Cell Scenario","SINR"]}],"abstract":"Deployment of femtocell in macrocell cellular network which forms two-tier femtocell-macrocell cellular network faces more complicated interference problems, since it uses the same licensed frequency spectrum as its macrocell. This paper addresses the interference problems for downlink transmission in such two-tier cellular communication network. In this paper, interference management using power control is proposed in that two-tier network. This paper considers multi-cell cellular network composing of three macrocell systems. Ten femtocells are deployed in each macrocell system. This paper takes worst case for the scenario that is all femtocells and macrocells in downlink transmissions. Simulation for the system without power control was carried out first as a baseline system. Then, two methods of power control called as PC-1 and PC-2 in this paper were explored to reduce the interference effects. The use of two power controls is to take a trade-off, the increasing of quality of service (QoS) in macrocell system while is not degrading much QoS in femtocell system. Both power control methods are based on the estimated Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR). Both of power control methods also ensure that the results of controlled transmitting power will not exceed the maximum or the minimum of allowable transmitting powers. Simulations have been carried out and performance parameter in term of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of SINR have been collected for co-tier (femtocell-femtocell and macrocell-macrocell), cross-tier (femtocell-macrocell and macrocell-femtocell), and the total interferences. The simulation results show that both power control methods outperform the baseline system.","doi":"10.1109/QIR.2017.8168533","publicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 15th International Conference on Quality in Research (QiR) : International Symposium on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121965/8168430/08168533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QIR.2017.8168533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168430","startPage":"479","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink power control for interference management in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink power control for interference management in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168533/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17415992","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168533/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink power control for interference management in femtocell-macrocell cellular communication network","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"E6D5371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063022S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121965","isNumber":"8168430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121965","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8168430","articleId":"8168533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168553,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfang Xiao","affiliation":["Energy Research Institute @, NTU Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jianfang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085464136"},{"name":"Xuan Bac Nguyen","affiliation":["Energy Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Xuan Bac","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37087212423"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Energy Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280434300"},{"name":"Jingjing Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085716973"},{"name":"Qing Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Radio Measurement, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086273035"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0971-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0972-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168553","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Load flow","DH-HEMTs","Voltage control","Topology","Bidirectional power flow","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","distributed power generation","high-frequency transformers","load flow","power generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency transformer","DHFT","DC-compatible energy sources","open-loop control","bidirectional power flow","hybrid AC-DC microgrid","DC-DC converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid","DHFT","CLLC","Bidirectional power flow","Conversion efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Hybrid AC/DC microgrid is a compromised solution to cater for the increasing penetration of DC-compatible energy sources, storages and loads.

This paper proposes the dc-link capacitor voltage balancing method where a common offset voltage is injected. The offset voltage consists of a harmonic voltage and a magnitude difference between the upper and the lower capacitors. Theoretical analysis is provided to balance the voltages, and it shows that both the odd and the even harmonics in the injected voltage compensates the unbalanced voltage between the capacitors.

It comprises an optical de-interleaver for carrier-sideband separation, a microring resonator (MRR) -based phase-shifter (PS) and a carrier depletion-based MRR electro-optic modulator. The photonic de-interleaver enables flexible operation with different RF frequencies.

The millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrum, spanning 30 GHz to 300 GHz, is a prime candidate to resolve the bandwidth limitation issue in future networks. High-speed electronics, though, are quite energy-inefficient for such mm-wave signal generation. Photonic-based sources are an alternative to provide the required frequencies and bandwidth, i.e., the field of microwave photonics. One promising technique to generate mm-waves is to modulate a single frequency laser at a relatively low frequency to generate a frequency comb. By beating two non-adjacent comb lines, a higher frequency beat note is generated. However, it is unclear yet how a photonic-based solution compares to an electronic-based solution in terms of energy-efficiency. In this work we theoretically explore the use and the energy-efficiency of mature silicon photonic integrated circuits to achieve mm-wave generation on a chip. We do this by setting up a simulation tool for calculating the energy consumption of the silicon photonic integrated circuit, including electronic driver power consumption. It is shown that silicon photonics based mm-wave generation is more efficient than electronic-based solutions for mm-wave frequencies exceeding 60 GHz. If transport is included, i.e., over a length of cable to reach remote antenna, it is shown that for mm-wave frequencies above 20 GHz and lengths over 3 m, silicon photonics is again more energy-efficient solution. This analysis shows that silicon photonic integrated circuits are a viable candidate for mm-wave generation in future 5G networks, for reasons of compact footprint, maturity of the technology and energy-efficiency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2017.8168654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168626","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121830/8168626/08168654.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon photonics to improve the energy-efficiency of millimeter wave communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8168654/","displayDocTitle":"Silicon photonics to improve the energy-efficiency of millimeter wave communication systems","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415819","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon photonics to improve the energy-efficiency of millimeter wave communication systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"THP1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04847S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121830","isNumber":"8168626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121830","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8168626","articleId":"8168654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8168656,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Zhou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085790618"},{"name":"Jing He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"He","id":"37086324075"},{"name":"Rui Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Deng","id":"37085586620"},{"name":"QingHui Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, ChangSha, China"],"firstName":"QingHui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085702919"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0762-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0761-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0763-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8168656","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Optical attenuators","Signal to noise ratio","Optical fibers","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band RoF system","DCT-spread FOFDM","low PAPR","fast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","discrete cosine transform","relatively flat signal-to-noise ratio","bit error rate improvement","DCT-spread-FOFDM signal","W-band radio-over-fiber system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FOFDM","DCT-spread","RoF","W-band"]}],"abstract":"A discrete cosine transform (DCT)-spread fast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FOFDM) signal with low PAPR is experimentally demonstrated in a W-band Radioover-fiber (RoF) system.

Spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) improve performance over a spread of user locations and these can benefit from wider antenna spacing. Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) transport provides flexibility in deploying a number of widely-spaced Remote Antenna Units (RAUs) connected to the same Central Unit (CU). Hence, mmW systems with an integrated analog RoF fronthaul are strong candidates for use in future 5G networks. An approach to measure channel coefficients individually for MIMO processing has been demonstrated in a RoF transported 2\u00d72 MIMO system at 60 GHz. Experimental results verify this approach through real 2\u00d72 experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8121830/8168626/08168700.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP)","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2017.8168700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2017.8168700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of radio-over-fiber-supported 60 GHz MIMO using separate antenna-pair processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas","Multiplexing","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","diversity reception","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radio-over-fibre","space division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio-over-fiber-supported MIMO","spatial diversity multiple-input multiple-output","RoF transported 2\u00d72 MIMO system","integrated analog RoF fronthaul","antenna spacing","spatial multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output","mmW systems","Central Unit","widely-spaced Remote Antenna Units","radio-over-Fiber transport","user locations","constraining bottleneck","millimeter-wave frequencies","separate antenna-pair processing","MIMO processing","future 5G networks","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Input Multiple Output MIMO","line of Sight","SISO","EVM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of radio-over-fiber-supported 60 GHz MIMO using separate antenna-pair processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8168700/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415834","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of radio-over-fiber-supported 60 GHz MIMO using separate antenna-pair processing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"THP8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084724S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8121830","isNumber":"8168626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8121830","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8168626","articleId":"8168700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8168702,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["ITEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Val\u00e9ncia, Valencia, spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37085357346"},{"name":"Ivana Gasulla","affiliation":["ITEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Val\u00e9ncia, Valencia, spain"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Gasulla","id":"37294237400"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Capmany","affiliation":["ITEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Val\u00e9ncia, Valencia, spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Capmany","id":"37277073500"},{"name":"Lee Crudgington","affiliation":["Optoelectronics Research Centre, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Crudgington","id":"37085884277"},{"name":"David J.

In this letter, a superpixel restrained deep neural network with multiple decisions (SRDNN-MDs) is proposed for PolSAR image classification, which not only extracts effective superpixel spatial features and degrades the influence of speckle noises but also deals with the limited training samples. First, the polarimetric features of coherency matrix and Yamaguchi decomposition are extracted as initial features, and superpixel segmentation is conducted on the Pauli color-coded image to acquire the superpixel averaged features. Then, an SRDNN based on sparse autoencoders is proposed to capture superpixel correlative features and reduce speckle noises. After that, MDs, including nonlocal decision and local decision, are developed to select credible testing samples. Finally, our deep network is updated by the extended training set to yield the final classification map. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRDNN-MD yields higher accuracies compared with other related approaches, which indicate that the proposed method is able to capture superpixel correlative information and adds the information of unlabeled samples to improve the classification performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/8240808/08168823.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semisupervised Classification of Polarimetric SAR Image via Superpixel Restrained Deep Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2017.2777450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2017.2777450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Semisupervised Classification of Polarimetric SAR Image via Superpixel Restrained Deep Neural Network","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17468561","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8168823/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFC1401007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671103"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of High Resolution Special Research","grantNumber":"41-Y30B12-9001-14/16"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17RC(3)024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semisupervised Classification of Polarimetric SAR Image via Superpixel Restrained Deep Neural Network","sourcePdf":"lgrs-geng-2777450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046272S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"8240808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8240808","articleId":"8168823","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8168830,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Han Chiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Tsung-Han","lastName":"Chiang","orcid":"0000-0003-1506-2880","id":"37085645081"},{"name":"John F.

Conduction in the two high-quality insulators is dominated by Ohmic conduction and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, whereas conduction in the two low-quality insulators involves Ohmic conduction and space-charge limited current (SCLC). Ohmic conduction and SCLC are somewhat puzzling mechanisms for contributing to insulator leakage current since they require the existence of an Ohmic contact at the cathode. Our conventional understanding of an Ohmic contact makes it difficult to ascertain how an Ohmic contact could be formed to a wide bandgap insulator. This Ohmic contact dilemma is resolved by formulating an equivalent circuit appropriate for assessing the J - \u03be characteristics of an insulator and then recognizing that an insulator Ohmic contact is obtained when the injection-limited current density from the cathode electrode is greater than that of the operative bulk-limited current density, i.e., Ohmic or SCLC for the four insulators under consideration.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2776612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8232422/08168830.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2776612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Conduction Mechanisms in Insulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8168830","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/16/8232422/8168830-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Conduction Mechanisms in Insulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8168830/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17481816","htmlLink":"/document/8168830/","volume":"65","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CHE-1606982"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Electronic Conduction Mechanisms in Insulators","sourcePdf":"ted-chiang-2776612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8232422","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8232422","articleId":"8168830","onlineDate":"06 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"ChildErratum","associateDoi":"10.1109/TED.2020.3016911","associateId":"9178964"}]},{"_id":8168836,"authors":[{"name":"Jagar Singh","affiliation":["GlobalFoundries, Malta, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jagar","lastName":"Singh","orcid":"0000-0002-8366-1650","id":"37073148700"},{"name":"J.

Among various performance aspects and design problems regarding massive MIMO, precoding at the base station (BS) is one of the most important function components to ensure reliable downlink transmission. This paper provides a survey of linear precoding techniques for downlink transmission under both single-cell (SC) and multicell (MC) scenarios. In an SC scenario, a series of classical precoding techniques are reviewed and compared. In an MC scenario, massive MIMO suffers from pilot contamination problems, where orthogonal pilot sequences have to be reused among cells, leading to estimation errors of channel state information at the transmitter. Precoding techniques with and without the cooperation among BSs are reviewed and the cooperative precoding techniques are further divided into partial and full cooperations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively surveys all the existing linear precoding techniques. The comprehensive review reveals current challenges in designing the precoders, where technical merits are usually bounded by practical implementation issues. We show that a viable precoding technique for massive MIMO systems is still unknown to date, and suggest several research potentials that are worthy of future research efforts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"12","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18272050","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169014/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO Linear Precoding: A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO Linear Precoding: A Survey","sourcePdf":"jsyst-xiang-2776401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172808S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8543256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8543256","articleId":"8169014","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169016,"authors":[{"name":"Gilberto Berardinelli","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8169016/berar-2781122-small.gif","p":["Gilberto Berardinelli received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees (cum laude) in telecommunication engineering from the University of L\u2019Aquila, Italy, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University, Denmark, in 2010.

Orientation Estimation Algorithm Combining Kalman Filter With Gradient Descent","abstract":"Availability and all-in-one functionality of smartphones have become a multipurpose personal tool to improve our daily life. Recent advancements in hardware and accessibility of smartphones have spawn huge potential for assistive healthcare, in particular telerehabilitation. However, using smartphone sensors face certain challenges, in particular, accurate orientation estimation, which is usually less of a problem in specialized motion tracking sensor devices. Drift is one of the challenges. We first propose a simple feedback loop complementary filter (CFF) to reduce the error caused by the integration of the gyroscope's data in the orientation estimation. Next, we propose a new and better orientation estimation algorithm which combines quaternion-based kalman filter with corrector estimates using gradient descent (KFGD). We then evaluate CFF's and KFGD's performance on two early-stage rehabilitation exercises. The results show that CFF is capable of fast motion tracking and confirm that the feedback loop can correct the error caused by the integration of gyroscope data. The KFGD orientation estimation is comparable to XSENS Awinda and has shown itself to be stable than and outperforms CFF. KFGD also outperforms the prominent Madgwick algorithm using mobile data. Thus, KFGD is suitable for low-cost motion sensors or mobile inertial sensors, especially during early recovery stage of sport injuries and exercise for the elderly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007314","pubMedId":"29990245","htmlLink":"/document/8169018/","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smartphone Orientation Estimation Algorithm Combining Kalman Filter With Gradient Descent","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University","grantNumber":"M4081329.020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smartphone Orientation Estimation Algorithm Combining Kalman Filter With Gradient Descent","sourcePdf":"jbhi-yean-2780879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08613S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8432070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8432070","articleId":"8169018","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169020,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Fei","affiliation":["Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, College of Optical Science and Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Chao Fei received the B.E. degree in information engineering from the\n Changshu Institute of Technology, Suzhou, China, in 2012, and the M.E. degree in optical engineering from the South\n China Normal University, Guangzhou, China, in 2015.

By combining the adaptive bit-power loading with nonlinear equalization, 7.33-Gb/s DMT-modulated UWOC under 15-m tap water is achieved at a bit error rate below the 7% hard-decision forward error correction (FEC) limit 3.8 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n. The electrical signal bandwidth is 1.25 GHz, which corresponds to an electrical spectrum efficiency of ~6 bit/s/Hz. The capacity-distance product reaches 109.95 Gb/s-m in a single channel UWOC system with tap water. Compared with the linear equalization case, the system capacity at the FEC limit for 15-m underwater transmission is improved by ~18% with the nonlinear equalization.

The most likely causes of this lack of momentum are the high overhead caused by route discovery and maintenance in typical implementations of the source routing paradigm (e.g., dynamic source routing) in terrestrial radio networks. In this paper, we revert this view and argue that source routing can in fact be a reliable and convenient routing paradigm in underwater networks, when properly implemented and tailored to the peculiarities of underwater acoustic channels. Our scheme, named SUN, successfully recasts the source routing approach by introducing a number of new features, which improve the routing performance especially in the presence of unstable network links and mobile nodes. SUN is scenario-independent by design: this means that it can work in any connected topology, and does not need any side information (such as the node location and depth, or the channel state) in order to operate correctly. We evaluate the performance of SUN by means of simulations using the DESERT Underwater framework. Our results show that SUN correctly manages routing in both static and mobile networks, and that in some scenarios it even achieves better performance than a competing flooding-based approach. We also test the performance of SUN in a thorough experimental campaign involving six nodes and carried out in a lake near Berlin. From these results, we conclude that SUN, and the source routing paradigm in general, are in fact feasible options for general-purpose routing in underwater acoustic networks.","topic":"Underwater Wireless Communications and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169027/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8169027/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573773","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Source Routing for Underwater Networking: The SUN Protocol","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Revisiting Source Routing for Underwater Networking: The SUN Protocol","sourcePdf":"access-casari-2779426-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120143S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Underwater Wireless Communications and Networking"],"articleId":"8169027","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8169033,"authors":[{"name":"Guangfu Ma","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8169033/ma-2780994-small.gif","p":["Guangfu Ma received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 1993 and 1987, respectively.

The control-oriented model is formulated with mismatched and matched lumped uncertainties, which reflect the multiple aerodynamic uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator saturation. Based on the universal approximation property of the radial basis function NN, an adaptive NN disturbance observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbances online using only the tracking error state as its input vector. The \u201cexplosion of terms\u201dproblem in backstepping is avoided using a tracking differentiator. To address the input constraints, a sigmoid function is introduced to approximate the saturation and guarantee that the control input is bounded. In particular, a novel auxiliary system, driven by the tracking error and the input error between the unconstrained input and the constrained input, which was processed using the sigmoid function, is further designed to reduce the saturation effects and satisfy the stability requirement. Via modification of the adaptive laws, the tracking errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded based on Lyapunov theory. Moreover, several simulations are investigated to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","topic":"Recent Advances in Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control of Aerospace Engineering Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17573775","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8169033/","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Backstepping-Based Neural Network Control for Hypersonic Reentry Vehicle With Input Constraints","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61603114"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Backstepping-Based Neural Network Control for Hypersonic Reentry Vehicle With Input Constraints","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2780994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1409S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Recent Advances in Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control of Aerospace Engineering Systems"],"articleId":"8169033","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169040,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yi","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8426041/8169040/yi-2780884-small.gif","p":["Jun Yi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and\n technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2002 and 2006,\n respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in\n 2010.","He is currently an Associate Professor at Chongqing University of Science and Technology, Chongqing, China.

The proposed PUMA array class achieves twice the bandwidth (from 3:1 to 6:1) of the conventional shorted via-based PUMA without using an external matching network and while retaining convenient unbalanced feeding, manufacturing, and assembly characteristics. The chief enabling technical innovation hinges upon the reconfiguration of shorting vias into capacitively-loaded vias that simultaneously: 1) mitigate low-frequency bandwidth-limiting loop modes and 2) shift problematic common-mode resonances out-of-band. A simple theoretical model based on ridged waveguides is proposed that qualitatively and quantitatively explains this novel common-mode mitigation. An infinite array operating over 3.53-21.2 GHz (6:1) is designed to achieve active VSWR <; {2, 2.5, 3.8} while scanning to {broadside, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0}, respectively, without oversampling the aperture. D-plane cross-polarization is around {-15, -10} dB for {45\u00b0, 60\u00b0} scans with high efficiency, i.e., 0.5 dB co-polarized gain loss on average. A dual-polarized prototype 256-port (128 elements per polarization) array is fabricated and measured having good agreement with full-wave finite array simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8278888/08169041.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2780878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2780878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Class of Planar Ultrawideband Modular Antenna Arrays With Improved Bandwidth","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Feeds","Bandwidth","Fabrication","Phased arrays","Ribs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","ridge waveguides","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar ultrawideband modular antenna arrays","assembly characteristics","shorting vias","capacitively-loaded vias","low-frequency bandwidth-limiting loop modes","infinite array","full-wave finite array simulations","PUMA arrays","unbalanced feeding","common-mode mitigation","co-polarized gain loss","frequency 3.53 GHz to 21.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dipole array","millimeter-wave array","phased array","planar array","ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A New Class of Planar Ultrawideband Modular Antenna Arrays With Improved Bandwidth","volume":"66","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8169041/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17559850","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009917","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research through the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Base Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Class of Planar Ultrawideband Modular Antenna Arrays With Improved Bandwidth","sourcePdf":"tap-logan-2780878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05714S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8278888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8278888","articleId":"8169041","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":8169042,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Ashraphijuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Ashraphijuo","id":"37085377618"},{"name":"Vaneet Aggarwal","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Vaneet","lastName":"Aggarwal","orcid":"0000-0001-9131-4723","id":"37302263100"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-2945-9240","id":"37281375000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8169042","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we study the deterministic sampling patterns for the completion of low-rank matrix, when corrupted with a sparse noise, also known as robust matrix completion.

With the CS technique, the measurement time is reduced and high-resolution reconstructed data are obtained. On the other hand, the computational time is increased because the CS algorithm requires slightly more time than conventional reconstruction algorithms. Therefore, reducing the computational time is a critical issue. In this paper, an improved CS algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on a greedy algorithm which solves CS problems using an iteration method. By reducing the number of iterations, the computational time of the proposed algorithm is reduced. The proposed CS algorithm is applied to a simple discrete Fourier transform problem and to millimeter-wave ground-based synthetic aperture radar imaging for verification.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2764949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8299599/08169043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2764949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution Millimeter-Wave Ground-Based SAR Imaging via Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169043/","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution Millimeter-Wave Ground-Based SAR Imaging via Compressed Sensing","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17596218","externalId":"9400504","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169043/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution Millimeter-Wave Ground-Based SAR Imaging via Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tmag-chung-2764949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083049S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8299599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8299599","articleId":"8169043","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169045,"authors":[{"name":"Yuejun Zheng","affiliation":["Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8278888/8169045/zheng-2780896-small.gif","p":["Yuejun Zheng received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetic field and microwave technology with the Information and Navigation Institute.","His current research interests include metasurface, metasurface antenna, and radiation and scattering integration technology."]},"firstName":"Yuejun","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0003-0177-3008","id":"37085716032"},{"name":"Jun Gao","affiliation":["Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8278888/8169045/gao-2780896-small.gif","p":["Jun Gao received the B.S and M.S degrees from Air Force Missile Institute (AFEI), Xi\u2019an, China, in 1984 and 1987, respectively.","In 1987, he joined AFEI as an Assistant Teacher and then became an Associate Professor in 2000.

In this paper, wideband gain enhancement and radar cross section (RCS) reduction of Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator antenna are both achieved by using chessboard arranged metamaterial superstrate (CAMS). The CAMS is formed by two kinds of frequency-selective surfaces. The upper surface of CAMS is designed to reduce RCS based on the phase cancellation principle, and the bottom surface is used to enhance antenna gain on the basis of FP resonator cavity theory. Both simulation and measured results indicate that compared with primary antenna, the gain of the proposed FP resonator antenna is enhanced by 4.9 dB at 10.8 GHz and the 3 dB gain bandwidth is from 9.4 to 11.1 GHz (16.58%). Meanwhile, the RCS of the proposed FP resonator antenna is reduced from 8 to 18 GHz, with peak reduction of 39.4 dB. The 10 dB RCS reduction is obtained almost from 9.6 to 16.9 GHz (55.09%) for arbitrary polarizations. Moreover, the in-band RCS is greatly reduced, owing to the combined effect of CAMS and FP resonator cavity.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2780896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8278888/08169045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2780896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278888","startPage":"590","endPage":"599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Gain Enhancement and RCS Reduction of Fabry\u2013Perot Resonator Antenna With Chessboard Arranged Metamaterial Superstrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Gain Enhancement and RCS Reduction of Fabry\u2013Perot Resonator Antenna With Chessboard Arranged Metamaterial Superstrate","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17559852","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169045/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271100, 61501494, 61671464 and 61701523"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundational Research Fund of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2017JM6025"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Foundation of Air Force Engineering University","grantNumber":"KGD08091601"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Gain Enhancement and RCS Reduction of Fabry\u2013Perot Resonator Antenna With Chessboard Arranged Metamaterial Superstrate","sourcePdf":"tap-zheng-2780896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116917S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8278888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8278888","articleId":"8169045","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8169046,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Ofinno Technologies, Herndon, VA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8318336/8169046/cirik-2780833-small.gif","p":["Ali Cagatay Cirik (S\u201913\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S and M.S. degrees in telecommunications and electronics engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Riverside, Riverside, in 2014.

Existing works on FD cellular systems focus on the maximization of overall throughput, which can result in unfairness between uplink and downlink channels depending on the self-interference power and inter-user interference levels. Therefore, to introduce fairness, in this paper, we consider the transmit and receive beamforming designs that maximize the harmonic-sum of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) in the uplink and downlink channels. We propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm which converges to a stationary point. Moreover, in order to address practical system design aspects, we consider the transceiver design that enforces robustness against imperfect channel state information (CSI) while providing fair performance among the users. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the worst case SINR among all users under norm-bounded CSI errors. We devise a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results verify the advantages of incorporating FD mode into cellular systems, and practical issues, such as CSI uncertainty and fairness performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780833","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8318336/08169046.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Fairness Transceiver Design for a Full-Duplex MIMO Multi-Cell System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Fairness Transceiver Design for a Full-Duplex MIMO Multi-Cell System","volume":"66","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617357","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169046/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Fairness Transceiver Design for a Full-Duplex MIMO Multi-Cell System","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cirik-2780833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16654S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8318336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8318336","articleId":"8169046","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169047,"authors":[{"name":"Katarzyna Kosek-Szott","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kosek-Szott","orcid":"0000-0001-7609-9420","id":"38272106900"},{"name":"Genti Cuka","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Genti","lastName":"Cuka","id":"37086339844"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8169047","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169047","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Mathematical model","Quality of service","Antennas","Transmitters","Receivers","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","quality of service","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TXOP sharing","QoS provisioning","IEEE 802.11ac Networks","transmission opportunity","quality of service","legacy-enhanced distributed channel access function","VHT DL MU-MIMO transmissions","medium access control layer throughput","802.11ac device settings","very high throughput 802.11ac amendment","downlink multiuser multiple input multiple output transmissions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless LAN","quality of service","IEEE 802.11ac","EDCA TXOP sharing","DL MU-MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Downlink multi-user multiple input multiple output (DL MU-MIMO) transmissions with transmission opportunity (TXOP) sharing introduced in the very high throughput (VHT) 802.11ac amendment are a new method for providing quality of service (QoS) different than the legacy-enhanced distributed channel access function.

To effectively utilize the limited cache size in practice, cooperative caching can be leveraged to exploit caching diversity, by allowing users served by multiple base stations under the emerging user-centric network architecture. This paper explores delay-optimal cooperative edge caching in large-scale user-centric mobile networks, where the content placement and cluster size are optimized based on the stochastic information of network topology, traffic distribution, channel quality, and file popularity. Specifically, a greedy content placement algorithm is proposed based on the optimal bandwidth allocation, which can achieve (1 - 1/e)-optimality with linear computational complexity. In addition, the optimal user-centric cluster size is studied, and a condition constraining the maximal cluster size is presented in explicit form, which reflects the tradeoff between caching diversity and spectrum efficiency. Extensive simulations are conducted for analysis validation and performance evaluation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed greedy content placement algorithm can reduce the average file transmission delay up to 45 percent compared with the non-cooperative and hit-ratio-maximal schemes. Furthermore, the optimal clustering is also discussed considering the influences of different system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2017.2780834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2780834","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8401834/08169053.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8401834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Edge Caching in User-Centric Clustered Mobile Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Edge Caching in User-Centric Clustered Mobile Networks","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17895150","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169053/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91638204"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Edge Caching in User-Centric Clustered Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-zhang-2780834-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132191S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8401834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"8401834","articleId":"8169053","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169054,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The large gain is attained by an antenna array with large element spacing, where all array element signals are combined approximately coherently over the entire angular receiving range. This functionality is achieved by the self-mixing principle, where an exact description via an intermediate frequency (IF) array factor is derived. For verification purposes, a 4 \u00d7 2 self-mixing array is fabricated and measured in the frequency range from 34 to 39 GHz. A multiple-resonance millimeter-wave microstrip patch antenna has been especially developed to achieve large bandwidth and a wide angular receiving range. The broad beamwidth is achieved by two parasitic patches and suitable radiation characteristics of the resonant modes. The self-mixing of the receive signal is realized at each antenna element by a Schottky diode with an optimized operating point. The down-converted array element signals are then combined and measured at the IF. The receive power is increased significantly over a large angular range compared with conventional array feeding techniques. The simulation results are verified by measurements, which show very good agreement.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2780897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278888","startPage":"702","endPage":"711","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8278888/08169056.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Self-Mixing Array With Large Gain and Wide Angular Receiving Range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169056/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Millimeter-Wave Self-Mixing Array With Large Gain and Wide Angular Receiving Range","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17559864","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)","grantNumber":"EI 352/17-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Millimeter-Wave Self-Mixing Array With Large Gain and Wide Angular Receiving Range","sourcePdf":"tap-kornprobst-2780897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072332S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8278888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8278888","articleId":"8169056","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169065,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassem Narimani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8169065/narim-2780086-small.gif","p":["Ghassem Narimani received the B.Sc. degree from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998, the M.Sc. degree from the Mosaheb Institute for Mathematical Research, Kharazmi University, Tehran, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2006, all in mathematics.

Hence, the standard Fourier transform techniques cannot be used to study the spectral characteristics of the received FS samples or to derive the transfer function (TF) of the corresponding digital minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver. In this paper, an analytical expression for the TF of the FS MMSE equalizer is derived, which includes the effects of the continuous-time to discrete-time (C/D) converter used at the receiver front end. Using this TF, the sources of instability of the FS least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm and the effects of the equalizer length and sampling phase on convergence of the LMS algorithm are explained. For stabilization of the FS LMS algorithm, conditions on the front-end C/D converter are provided, such that, when satisfied the LMS algorithm becomes more stable and the learning characteristics of the modified receiver are better than the leaky-FS LMS algorithm. Theoretical results are corroborated by simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Receivers","Algorithm design and analysis","Bandwidth","Stability analysis","Convergence","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","Fourier transforms","least mean squares methods","signal sampling","spectral analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least-mean-square","digital minimum mean-square error receiver","convergence","leaky-FS LMS algorithm","modified receiver","front-end C/D converter","stabilization","sampling phase","equalizer length","receiver front end","discrete-time converter","FS MMSE equalizer","TF","transfer function","received FS samples","spectral characteristics","standard Fourier transform techniques","wide-sense cyclostationary time series","received signal","linear modulation scheme","communication systems","fractionally-spaced MMSE equalizers","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizer","least mean-square (LMS) algorithm","fractionally-spaced (FS) equalizer","adaptive equalizer","leaky LMS algorithm","tap-leakage method"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780086","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08169065.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Fractionally-Spaced MMSE Equalizers and Stability of the LMS Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Fractionally-Spaced MMSE Equalizers and Stability of the LMS Algorithm","accessionNumber":"17699062","publicationDate":"April 2018","volume":"66","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169065/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Analysis of Fractionally-Spaced MMSE Equalizers and Stability of the LMS Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcomm-narimani-2780086-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8169065","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169071,"authors":[{"name":"Dhivya Ravichandran","affiliation":["ECE, SEEE, SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/8264912/8169071/ravic-2780881-small.gif","p":["Dhivya Ravichandran received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the St. Joseph\u2019s College of Engineering, Chennai, in 2012, and the M.Tech. degree from SASTRA University, Thanjavur, in 2014.

Also with the increased data traffic, it is hard to transmit the entire bulky medical data. New methods have come into the scene to reduce the traffic while maintaining the sufficient level of security. Partial encryption is one of the methods which selectively encrypt the bulky medical image. Meanwhile, if the same medical image is needed to be reused for another diagnosis, then it is recommended to protect the entire medical image. This paper proposes a hybrid encryption scheme based on deoxyribo nucleic acid and chaotic maps, which can be adaptable for both selective and full medical image encryption. The proposed algorithm uses multiple chaotic maps in single process to generate the highly random keys for encrypting the color digital imaging and communications in medicine image. The algorithm comprises three phases, namely, permutation, encoding, and diffusion. In all the phases, the selection of specific rule set depends on the key sequences produced from the combined chaotic system. Experimental results are carried out to validate the resistance of the developed algorithm toward statistical, differential, and brute force attacks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2017.2780881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8264912","startPage":"850","endPage":"858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/8264912/08169071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNA Chaos Blend to Secure Medical Privacy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169071/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"DNA Chaos Blend to Secure Medical Privacy","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17490265","pubMedId":"29364129","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"8","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"INSPIRE Fellowship","grantNumber":"DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2015/IF150628"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNA Chaos Blend to Secure Medical Privacy","sourcePdf":"tnb-amirtharajan-2780881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063986S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"8264912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8264912","articleId":"8169071","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169073,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Lyu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8169073/feng-2780829-small.gif","p":["Feng Lyu received the B.S. degree in software from the Central South\n University,\u00a0Changsha, China, in 2013.

To devise a MAC for safety message broadcasting with reliability and minimum delay, in this paper, we propose a novel time slot-sharing MAC, referred to as SS-MAC, which can support diverse periodical broadcasting rates. In specific, we first introduce a circular recording queue to online perceive time slot occupying status. We then design a distributed time slot sharing (DTSS) algorithm and random index first fit (RIFF) algorithm, to efficiently share the time slot and make the online vehicle-slot matching, respectively. We prove theoretically the efficacy of DTSS algorithm, and evaluate the efficiency of RIFF algorithm by using MATLAB simulations. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations considering various driving scenarios and resource conditions to demonstrate the SS-MAC performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2780829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2780829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08169073.pdf","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SS-MAC: A Novel Time Slot-Sharing MAC for Safety Messages Broadcasting in VANETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"SS-MAC: A Novel Time Slot-Sharing MAC for Safety Messages Broadcasting in VANETs","volume":"67","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169073/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699027","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169073/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472255, 61420106010, 61373157, 61471236, 91638204 and 61772340"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SS-MAC: A Novel Time Slot-Sharing MAC for Safety Messages Broadcasting in VANETs","sourcePdf":"tvt-lyu-2780829-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170247S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8169073","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169075,"authors":[{"name":"Shashank Tiwari","affiliation":["G.

However, it requires receivers with high computational complexity. Among different linear receiver structures, the joint minimum mean square error (joint-MMSE) receiver for GFDM achieves the best bit-error-rate (BER) performance, but it is the most computationally complex linear receiver. In this paper, we present a novel low complexity joint-MMSE receiver. We derive the closed-form expression for the joint-MMSE receiver filter by harnessing circulant properties of the matrices involved in the demodulation process. Amidst different operations involved in the receiver processing, inversion of a positive definite circulant-plus-diagonal matrix is found to be the costliest. Two low-complexity algorithms for the inversion of a positive definite circulant-plus-diagonal matrix are developed to design the low complexity receiver. We also propose a low complexity bias correction to improve BER performance. Our proposed receiver achieves a log-linear order of complexity without any noticeable loss in BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2780854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08169075.pdf","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Joint-MMSE GFDM Receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Joint-MMSE GFDM Receiver","volume":"66","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169075/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699074","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169075/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Joint-MMSE GFDM Receiver","sourcePdf":"tcomm-tiwari-2780854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119676S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8169075","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169082,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed F.

The SU vacates the channel at the presence of the PU and selects a target channel reactively or proactively to complete his interrupted transmission. Target channel sequence order can greatly affect the performance of the network in terms of delay, capacity, and utilization. The probabilistic sequence target channel selection approach was shown to distribute the load smoothly among the available channels resulting in good load balancing characteristics and increasing network capacity and stability for an appropriate distribution function. In this paper, a new proactive probabilistic sequence approach to determine the target channel for the interrupted SUs is proposed to achieve load balancing. The pre-emptive resume priority M/M/1 queueing network model is used to analyse the proposed approach to evaluate the latency and load balancing performance. Moreover, a new quantitative performance measure for balancing is introduced. The proposed approach is compared to other alternative spectrum handoff strategies and numerical results show the advantage of the proposed probabilistic sequence approach by improving balancing and channel capacity. Moreover, the extended data delivery time is improved at low network loads.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2780840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307506","startPage":"43","endPage":"52","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8307506/08169082.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Probabilistic Target Channel Selection Approach for Load Balancing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169082/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Probabilistic Target Channel Selection Approach for Load Balancing in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633505","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Probabilistic Target Channel Selection Approach for Load Balancing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tccn-tayel-2780840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121901S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8307506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8307506","articleId":"8169082","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169083,"authors":[{"name":"Husam Elfadil","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Husam","lastName":"Elfadil","orcid":"0000-0001-8015-3856","id":"37086363212"},{"name":"Mehdi Maleki","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Maleki","orcid":"0000-0003-2170-7649","id":"38519804200"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Bahrami","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Bahrami","orcid":"0000-0001-9682-0860","id":"37288062200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8169083","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Encoding","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Modulation","Correlation","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","modulation","sorting","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorting order","NPM","nearest SM symbol","novel low-complexity adaptive bit mapping scheme","spatial modulation","subsequent SM symbols","nearest point method","bit sequences","space shift keying","channel state information-at-the-transmitter","channel distribution","correlation information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit mapping","spatial modulation","space shift keying"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel low-complexity adaptive bit mapping scheme for spatial modulation (SM) called the nearest point method (NPM). In this scheme, the SM symbols are first sorted according to a certain sorting order, then bit sequences that are different only in 1 bit are assigned to subsequent SM symbols according to that sorting order. To determine the sorting order, NPM starts with the pair of SM symbols that has the minimum distance. From one of the SM symbols in that pair, it identifies the nearest SM symbol and continues to do so until it visits all the SM symbols without visiting the same SM symbol more than once. Simulation results show that NPM achieves performance close to the lower bound of the BER for SM and space shift keying (SSK) using full channel state information at the transmitter. It also achieves BER improvement for SSK using the channel distribution and correlation information.

Since OFDM signals are weak toward subcarrier misalignment caused by frequency offsets, some form of interference cancellation will definitely be required for operation in real scenarios. A simple and flexible system level interference cancellation algorithm is proposed, which is to be employed when the radar estimation is no longer reliable. For the proof-of-concept verification, the MIMO RadCom node is implemented on universal software radio peripherals to take hardware imperfections and propagation losses into account. Real-time measurements are also presented to prove the 2D+velocity estimation capability as well as the effectiveness of the interference cancellation algorithm. With this system concept, the dual functions of the RadCom node will be possible in a realistic automotive scenario for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication with the aim of enhancing overall road safety by making driving a collaborative effort instead of an individual one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Mutual Interference Cancellation in a MIMO OFDM Multiuser Radar-Communication Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2781149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08169087.pdf","startPage":"3339","endPage":"3348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2781149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"On Mutual Interference Cancellation in a MIMO OFDM Multiuser Radar-Communication Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8169087/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699026","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Mutual Interference Cancellation in a MIMO OFDM Multiuser Radar-Communication Network","sourcePdf":"tvt-sit-2781149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08553S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8169087","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169089,"authors":[{"name":"Muthupandian Cheralathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Muthupandian","lastName":"Cheralathan","id":"37947833300"},{"name":"Martin Claus","affiliation":["Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Claus","orcid":"0000-0001-8009-8463","id":"38480998000"},{"name":"Stefan Blawid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Blawid","orcid":"0000-0001-6982-4575","id":"38481407500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8169089","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169089","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","CNTFETs","Logic gates","Capacitance","Carbon nanotubes","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","current-mode logic","frequency dividers","logic gates","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotube current-mode logic","process variability","radio frequency analog applications","extrinsic peak operating frequencies","CNT field-effect transistors","wafer scale","benchmark circuits","single CML stage","CNT density","five-stage CML ring oscillator","output voltage swing","metallic tube reduction","metallic tube fraction","current-mode logic buffer-inverter","source-drain shorts","frequency 40.0 GHz","frequency 2.4 GHz","voltage 1.8 V","current 1.8 mA","voltage 600 mV","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon electronics","carbon nanotube","CNTFET","process variability","current-mode logic","oscillator"]}],"abstract":"Radio frequency (RF) analog applications present an interesting opportunity for carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronics.

Therefore, predictions about the behavior of benchmark circuits at the process corners are required to further stimulate complex RF design and fabrication.

The single CML stage is very robust against variations in CNT density but vulnerable to source-drain shorts introduced by metallic tubes in the channel. A corresponding five-stage CML ring oscillator shows considerably reduced output voltage swing beyond two percent metallic tube fraction indicating the importance of metallic tube reduction by technology dependent strategies like presorting, post-elimination, or type-selective growth.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2781139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8365894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2781139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8365894/08169089.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projected Tolerances of Carbon Nanotube Current-Mode Logic to Process Variability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Projected Tolerances of Carbon Nanotube Current-Mode Logic to Process Variability","volume":"65","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169089/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17800983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169089/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES via the Project NAnoPiE","grantNumber":"88881.030371/2013-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"DFG","grantNumber":"CL384/2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projected Tolerances of Carbon Nanotube Current-Mode Logic to Process Variability","sourcePdf":"tcsii-blawid-2781139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087097S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8365894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8365894","articleId":"8169089","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169093,"authors":[{"name":"Omar A.

Equipped with a massive number of single photon detectors, the sensor has a threshold q above which the number of arriving photons will trigger a binary response \u201c1\u201d, or \u201c0\u201d otherwise. Existing methods in the device literature typically assume that q = 1 uniformly. We argue that a spatial-temporally varying threshold can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image. In this paper, we present an optimal threshold design framework. We make two contributions. First, we derive a set of oracle results to theoretically inform the maximally achievable performance. We show that the oracle threshold should match exactly with the underlying pixel intensity. Second, we show that around the oracle threshold there exists a set of thresholds that give asymptotically unbiased reconstructions. The asymptotic unbiasedness has a phase transition behavior which allows us to develop a practical threshold update scheme using a bisection method. Experimentally, the new threshold design method achieves better rate of convergence than existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2017.2781185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8287087/08169093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2017.2781185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8287087","startPage":"99","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Threshold Design for Quanta Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Threshold Design for Quanta Image Sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17561772","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169093/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1718007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Threshold Design for Quanta Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"tci-chan-2781185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089286S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8287087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8287087","articleId":"8169093","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169099,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen D.

In most of these algorithms, the estimation of the BSS filters relies on the accurate association of each time-frequency bin to the dominant source at that bin. The TF bin associations are then used to estimate the statistics of the source signals, and BSS is achieved by optimal spatial filters computed using the estimated statistics. The main objective of this paper is to apply such a framework to scenarios with an unknown number of moving sources. While state-of-the-art approaches employ online clustering algorithms to solve the problem for moving sources, we propose an approximate Bayesian tracker and perform the association of each TF bin to the dominant source using the tracker's measurement-to-source association probabilities. Therefore, the choice of the underlying narrowband models and measurements for the tracker as well as the resulting tracking algorithm constitute the main contributions of this paper. The TF bin associations obtained from the tracker are then used to estimate the statistics of the source signals. The performance of the resulting BSS filters is compared to the performance of state-of-the-art sparsity-based and independent vector analysis-based BSS algorithms. Our proposed approach targets scenarios with at least two spatially separated microphone arrays, with known microphone positions and relative orientations. The framework also allows for efficient management of a time-varying number of sources.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2780993","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8253682/08169100.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2780993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253682","startPage":"657","endPage":"670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Moving Sources Using Sparsity-Based Source Detection and Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Moving Sources Using Sparsity-Based Source Detection and Tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17485428","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169100/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation of Moving Sources Using Sparsity-Based Source Detection and Tracking","sourcePdf":"taslp-taseska-2780993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077579S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8169100","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169102,"authors":[{"name":"Keke Gai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8426041/8169102/gai-2780885-small.gif","p":["Keke Gai (M\u201917\u2013S\u201913) received the B.Eng. degree\n majored in automation, from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2004, the M.E.T.\n (Master's of Educational Technology) degree in educational technology from the University of British Columbia,\n Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2010, the MBA degree in business Administration, in 2009, M.S. degree in information\n technology, in 2014, from the Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI, USA, and the Ph.D. degree in computer\n science from Pace University, New York, NY, USA.","He is currently an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of\n Technology, Beijing, China.

The encrypted data are relatively considered a safe storage status; however, the process of encrypting data is still facing adversarial actions and data process generally is inapplicable over ciphertexts. As a type of the encryption approach allowing computations over ciphertexts, a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can concurrently deal with the adversarial hazards and support computations on ciphertexts. This paper focuses on the issue of blend arithmetic operations over real numbers and proposes a novel tensor-based FHE solution. The proposed approach is called a FHE for blend operations model that uses tensor laws to carry the computations of blend arithmetic operations over real numbers. In our paper, we provide both theoretical proof and experimental evaluations in order to evince the adoptability of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8426041/08169102.pdf","startPage":"3590","endPage":"3598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2780885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2780885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8426041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blend Arithmetic Operations on Tensor-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over Real Numbers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Informatics","Algorithm design and analysis","Cloud computing","Tensile stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ciphertexts","blend arithmetic operations","novel tensor-based FHE solution","blend operations model","tensor laws","tensor-based fully homomorphic encryption","recent booming growth","networking-based solutions","outsider threats","adversarial hazards","encryption approach","adversarial actions","safe storage status","encrypted data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)","Internet-of-Things (IoT)","privacy","security","tensor theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Blend Arithmetic Operations on Tensor-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over Real Numbers","volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8169102/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blend Arithmetic Operations on Tensor-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over Real Numbers","sourcePdf":"tii-qiu-2780885-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083651S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8426041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8426041","articleId":"8169102","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169103,"authors":[{"name":"Feiran Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feiran","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-1734-3785","id":"38239890700"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-2807-6130","id":"37085509225"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8169103","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":565},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","echo suppression","frequency-domain analysis","optimal control","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echo cancellation","optimal step-size control","partitioned block frequency-domain adaptive filter","variable step-size schemes","robust optimal control approach","variable step-size PBFDAF algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","variable step size","frequency domain","echo cancellation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8365894/08169103.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2780880","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2780880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8365894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Step-Size Control of the Partitioned Block Frequency-Domain Adaptive Filter","abstract":"The partitioned block frequency-domain adaptive filter (PBFDAF) is appealing in echo cancellation due to its computational efficiency and good convergence property.

Numerical results reveal that, when the number of D2DC receivers is large, the proposed scheme achieves the near optimal sum effective throughput, which can be obtained by using full information of device locations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17561855","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169104/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiple Device-to-Device Cluster Multicast Communications Underlay Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1D1A1B03933174 and NRF-2016R1D1A1B03930250"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multiple Device-to-Device Cluster Multicast Communications Underlay Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lee-2780819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059424S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8288712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8288712","articleId":"8169104","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169107,"authors":[{"name":"Shengcheng Wang","affiliation":["Chair of Dependable Nano Computing, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8300457/8169107/wang-2775586-small.gif","p":["Shengcheng Wang (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2010.

To mitigate this problem, a typical solution is to use through-silicon via (TSV) redundancy in a reactive manner, maintaining the operability of a 3-D chip in the presence of EM failures by detecting and replacing faulty TSVs with spares. In this paper, we explore an alternative, more preferred approach to enhance the EM-related lifetime reliability of TSV grid, in which redundancy is used proactively to allow nonfaulty TSVs to be temporarily deactivated. In this way, EM wear-out can be extended by exploiting its recovery property. The proposed solution is based on two consecutive stages, in which TSV redundancy allocation and TSV repair are finalized at both design-time and runtime, respectively. Applied to 3-D benchmark designs, the recovery-aware proactive repair approach increases EM-related lifetime reliability (measured in mean-time-to-failure) of the entire TSV grid by up to 12\u00d7 relative to the conventional reactive method, with similar area overhead. In addition, a runtime dynamic recovery approach is proposed to further improve EM-related lifetime reliability to account for stress variation across different chips and over the operational lifetime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"26","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17596422","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169107/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recovery-Aware Proactive TSV Repair for Electromigration Lifetime Enhancement in 3-D ICs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery-Aware Proactive TSV Repair for Electromigration Lifetime Enhancement in 3-D ICs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2775586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16907S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8300457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8300457","articleId":"8169107","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169108,"authors":[{"name":"Yasamin Keshmiri Esfandabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/8272539/8169108/esfan-2780901-small.gif","p":["Yasamin Keshmiri Esfandabadi (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and the M.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from the University of Qazvin, Qazvin, Iran, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.

In fact, extracting information that allows the estimation of the damage condition of a structure can be a time-consuming process. This paper presents a damage detection and localization technique based on a compressive sensing algorithm, which significantly allows us to reduce the acquisition time without losing in detection accuracy. The proposed technique exploits the sparsity of the wavefield in different representation domains, such as those spanned by wave atoms, curvelets, and Fourier exponentials to recover the full wavefield and, at the same time, to infer the damage location, based on comparison between the wavefield reconstructions produced by the different representation domains. The procedure is applied to three different setups related to an aluminum plate with a notch, a glass fiber reinforced polymer plate with a notch, and a composite plate with a delamination. The results show that the technique can be applied in a variety of structural components to reduce acquisition time and achieve high performance in defect detection and localization by removing up to 80% of the Nyquist sampling grid.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2780901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/8272539/08169108.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2780901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8272539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Wavefield Analysis and Damage Imaging Through Compressive Sensing in Lamb Wave Inspections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169108/","displayDocTitle":"Full Wavefield Analysis and Damage Imaging Through Compressive Sensing in Lamb Wave Inspections","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17525889","pubMedId":"29389658","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169108/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Wavefield Analysis and Damage Imaging Through Compressive Sensing in Lamb Wave Inspections","sourcePdf":"tuffc-keshmiri-2780901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068608S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"8272539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8272539","articleId":"8169108","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169109,"authors":[{"name":"Sangwon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangwon","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0001-7819-7892","id":"37086165683"},{"name":"Joonsung Lee","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Center, Nokia, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joonsung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086341148"},{"name":"Chungyong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chungyong","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-7469-906X","id":"37280420600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8169109","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Modulation","Matrix decomposition","Receiving antennas","Correlation","Downlink","Precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink multiuser transmission","partial CSI","downlink massive multiple input multiple output systems","noncodebook-based precoding","multiuser space shift keying","multiuser interference suppression","covariance matrix","receive antennas","SSK","channel state information acquisition","massive MIMO systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO system","space-shift keying","downlink multi-user system","non-codebook-based precoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8309483/08169109.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2780828","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2780828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space Shift Keying for Downlink Multi-User Transmission With Partial CSI in Massive MIMO Systems","abstract":"To reduce the burden of channel state information (CSI) acquisition in downlink massive multiple input and multiple output systems, we propose a non-codebook-based precoding scheme for multi-user space shift keying (SSK).

In particular, each node sequentially receives a variable length data sequence with its label and can only exchange information with its neighbors to train the LSTM architecture. We first provide a generic LSTM-based regression structure for each node. In order to train this structure, we put the LSTM equations in a nonlinear state-space form for each node and then introduce a highly effective and efficient distributed particle filtering (DPF)-based training algorithm. We also introduce a distributed extended Kalman filtering-based training algorithm for comparison.

A binary sequence of a given length generated this way has a one-to-one correspondence with a given range of the input signal. This can be used to construct analogue to digital converters (ADC). However, in actual circuit realizations, component imperfections and ambient noise result in deviations in the map function from the ideal, which, in turn, can cause significant error in signal measurement. In this paper, we propose the ways of circumventing these problems through an algorithmic procedure that takes into account the non-idealities. The most common form of non-ideality - reduction in the height of the map function - alters the partitions that correspond to each symbolic sequence. We show that it is possible to define the partitions correctly if the height of the map function is known. We also propose a method to estimate this height from the symbolic sequence obtained. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm with simulation as well as experiment. With this development, practical ADCs utilizing chaotic dynamics may become reality.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2773202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2773202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08169115.pdf","startPage":"2221","endPage":"2231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithmic Approach for Signal Measurement Using Symbolic Dynamics of Tent Map","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithmic Approach for Signal Measurement Using Symbolic Dynamics of Tent Map","volume":"65","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169115/","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17801676","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169115/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithmic Approach for Signal Measurement Using Symbolic Dynamics of Tent Map","sourcePdf":"tcsi-basu-2773202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139173S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8169115","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169116,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Tian","orcid":"0000-0002-4810-5798","id":"37085745403"},{"name":"Yuzhuo Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Yuzhuo","lastName":"Li","id":"37086350682"},{"name":"Yun Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Yun Wei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-5410-4505","id":"37086090838"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"8169116","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1099},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Topology","Switches","Inverters","Pulse width modulation","Switching frequency","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drives","power capacitors","power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-speed operation capability","(HC) topology","medium-voltage motor","competitive performance","floating capacitor voltage","switching frequency","low capacitor voltage ripples","low fundamental frequencies","multipulse diode front-end","active front-end structures","7L active front end","dc-link capacitors","medium voltage drives","high-performance capability","seven-level hybrid topology","voltage 4.16 kV to 6.6 kV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medium voltage drive","multilevel converters (MLCs)","voltage balancing"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a novel seven-level (7L) hybrid-clamped converter, which has competitive performance and lower device count compared to existing topologies.

Feedforward capacitors are implemented in each differential cascode digital power cell. These feedforward capacitors operate together with a proposed DPA biasing scheme to minimize the DPA output device capacitance Cd variations over a wide output power range and a wide carrier frequency bandwidth, resulting in DPA AM-PM distortion reduction. A three-coil transformer-based DPA output passive network is implemented within a single transformer footprint (330 \u03bcm \u00d7 330 \u03bcm) and provides parallel power combining and load impedance transformation with a low loss, an octave bandwidth, and a large impedance transformation ratio. Moreover, this proposed power amplifier (PA) output passive network shows a desensitized phase response to Cd variations and further suppresses the DPA AM-PM distortion. Both proposed AM-PM distortion self-compensation techniques are effective for a large carrier frequency range and a wide modulation bandwidth, and are independent of the DPA AM control codes. This results in a superior inherent DPA phase linearity and reduces or even eliminates the need for phase predistortion, which dramatically simplifies the DPA pre-distortion computations. As a proof-of-concept, a 2-4.3 GHz wideband DPA is implemented in a standard 28-nm bulk CMOS process. Operating with a low supply voltage of 1.4 V for enhanced reliability, the DPA demonstrates \u00b10.5 dB PA output power bandwidth from 2 to 4.3 GHz with +24.9 dBm peak output power at 3.1 GHz. The measured peak PA drain efficiency is 42.7% at 2.5 GHz and is more than 27% from 2 to 4.3 GHz. The measured PA AM-PM distortion is within 6.8\u00b0 at 2.8 GHz over the PA output power dynamic range of 25 dB, achieving the lowest AM-PM distortion among recently reported current-mode DPAs in the same frequency range.

It significantly reduces the training complexity of recurrent neural networks and is also suitable for hardware implementation whereby device physics are utilized in performing data processing. In this paper, the RC concept is applied to detecting a transmitted symbol in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Due to wireless propagation, the transmitted signal may undergo severe distortion before reaching the receiver. The nonlinear distortion introduced by the power amplifier at the transmitter may further complicate this process. Therefore, an efficient symbol detection strategy becomes critical. The conventional approach for symbol detection at the receiver requires accurate channel estimation of the underlying MIMO-OFDM system. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel symbol detection scheme where the estimation of the MIMO-OFDM channel becomes unnecessary. The introduced scheme utilizes an echo state network (ESN), which is a special class of RC. The ESN acts as a black box for system modeling purposes and can predict nonlinear dynamic systems in an efficient way. Simulation results for the uncoded bit error rate of nonlinear MIMO-OFDM systems show that the introduced scheme outperforms conventional symbol detection methods.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2766162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8468244/08169663.pdf","startPage":"4694","endPage":"4708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8468244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2766162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain-Inspired Wireless Communications: Where Reservoir Computing Meets MIMO-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169663","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5962385/8468244/8169663-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Brain-Inspired Wireless Communications: Where Reservoir Computing Meets MIMO-OFDM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169663/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18111614","pubMedId":"29990240","htmlLink":"/document/8169663/","volume":"29","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1731928"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Brain-Inspired Wireless Communications: Where Reservoir Computing Meets MIMO-OFDM","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2766162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151915S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8468244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8468244","articleId":"8169663","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169665,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Saad Khan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","EED, University College of Engineering and Technology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Saad","lastName":"Khan","orcid":"0000-0001-6671-4020","id":"37085627806"},{"name":"Hongxin Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongxin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38560196500"},{"name":"Xueli Wang","affiliation":["School of Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085835438"},{"name":"Rahat Ullah","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rahat","lastName":"Ullah","id":"38069308000"},{"name":"Ibrar Ahmad","affiliation":["Center for Intelligence of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ibrar","lastName":"Ahmad","orcid":"0000-0001-9093-9158","id":"37086140169"},{"name":"Sulman Shahzad","affiliation":["EED, University College of Engineering and Technology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sulman","lastName":"Shahzad","id":"37086327317"},{"name":"Qasim Ali Arain","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qasim Ali","lastName":"Arain","id":"37086327358"},{"name":"Muhammad Zahid Tunio","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad Zahid","lastName":"Tunio","orcid":"0000-0002-9406-0586","id":"37085386286"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8169665","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1515},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"Broadband and highly efficient amplifiers are of great interest in modern wireless communication systems.

Theoretical analysis for computing the resonant frequencies is shown, and the design approach of implementing \u03c0-section stubs connected to the ring to obtain the bandwidth reconfigurability is explained. The use of reconfigurable \u03c0-section allows the alteration of the stub's effective width and therefore the filter's bandwidth reconfigurability. p-i-n diodes are used as switching elements to achieve the narrowband/wideband response. Coupled line sections are used for suppressing the higher modes by generating out-of-band transmission zeros, resulting in a significantly enhanced out-of-band rejection. Measurements indicate that the 3-dB fractional bandwidth can be switched from 58.5% to 75% at a fixed center frequency of 2.4 GHz with an insertion loss better than 1.1 dB.

An algorithm is proposed that allows estimating values of the considered set of the parameters. The algorithm exploits a diagnostic test performed in a dc state, leading to output voltages measured in the circuit. Each of the output voltages is a parameterized function. A system of overdetermined equations fitting the parameterized functions to the data points is created. An efficient iterative method is developed for solving this overdetermined system of nonlinear equations exploiting the idea of the normal equation and a homotopy concept. It is implemented in the manner that allows operating with the functions not given in the explicit analytical form, which commonly occurs in real nonlinear circuits. For illustration, two examples are given, including a circuit with bipolar transistors and a CMOS circuit designed in a nanometer technology. They reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2017.2775438","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/8246665/08169673.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2017.2775438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Local Parametric Fault Diagnosis of a Broad Class of Analog Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Local Parametric Fault Diagnosis of a Broad Class of Analog Integrated Circuits","volume":"67","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17520065","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169673/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education","grantNumber":"DIR/WK/2016/03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Local Parametric Fault Diagnosis of a Broad Class of Analog Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tim-tadeusiewicz-2775438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114822S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"8246665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8246665","articleId":"8169673","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":8169674,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqing Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8169674/zhou-2780818-small.gif","p":["Tianqing Zhou received the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2016.

To fully exploit the potential of new network architecture, the cell selection (CS) in such HetNets should couple with reducing power consumption and network interference. To this end, we jointly perform cell activation and selection (CAS) to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE) under users' long-term rate constraints. The formulated problem is in a mixed-integer fractional form and hard to tackle. We need to transform it into a parametric subtractive form, by which we reach its solution through a three-layer iterative algorithm. The first layer searches an EE parameter using a bisection method; the second layer alternately optimizes CAS indices; the third layer solves CS and cell activation (CA) problems using dual decomposition and fixed point iteration, respectively. At last, we give some complexity and convergence analyses for the designed algorithm, and investigate the impacts of different network parameters on system performance. The simulation results show that the CA introduced in CS is a good option to reduce energy consumption and network interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08169674.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Cell Activation and Selection for Green Communications in Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Networks","topic":"Recent Advances in Computational Intelligence paradigms for Security and Privacy for Fog and Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169674/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Cell Activation and Selection for Green Communications in Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Networks","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573777","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41402290, 61462028, 61422105, 61271018, 71361009, 61671144, 61372101 and 61221002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010097","fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003006-002 and 2012ZX03004-005-003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863)","grantNumber":"2014AA012104"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973)","grantNumber":"2012CB316004 and 2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Major Project for Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China","grantNumber":"20152ACB21011"},{"fundingName":"Jiangxi Provincial Cultivation Program for Academic and Technical Leaders of Major Subjects","grantNumber":"20172BCB22017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Funds for Supporting Excellent Young Professors for Teaching and Research in Southeast University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Cell Activation and Selection for Green Communications in Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2780818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087203S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Recent Advances in Computational Intelligence paradigms for Security and Privacy for Fog and Mobile Edge Computing"],"articleId":"8169674","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169682,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Shitomi","affiliation":["Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK), Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/8372838/8169682/shito-2755262-small.gif","p":["Takuya Shitomi received the M.Eng. degree in systems science from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, in 2005.

Regarding MIMO channel estimation, two pilot encoding algorithms known as Walsh-Hadamard encoding and Null Pilot encoding are possible in ATSC 3.0. The two MIMO pilot algorithms are standardized so as to have the same pilot positions and the same pilot boosting as single-input single-output, and the optimum pilot configuration has not been fully evaluated for MIMO. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation and optimization of the pilot boosting and the pilot patterns for two MIMO pilot encoding algorithms in ATSC 3.0 using physical layer simulations. This paper provides a great benefit to broadcasters to select the MIMO pilot configuration including pilot boosting, pilot pattern, and pilot encoding algorithm that better suits their service requirements. Several channel interpolation algorithms have been taken into account as a typical receiver implementation in both fixed SFN reception and mobile reception.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2017.2755262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/8372838/08169682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2017.2755262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8372838","startPage":"188","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Scattered Pilot Performance and Optimization for ATSC 3.0","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Scattered Pilot Performance and Optimization for ATSC 3.0","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17821740","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8169682/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain","grantNumber":"TEC2014-56483-R"},{"fundingName":"European FEDER Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Scattered Pilot Performance and Optimization for ATSC 3.0","sourcePdf":"tbc-shitomi-2755262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093375S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"8372838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8372838","articleId":"8169682","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8169683,"authors":[{"name":"Yeonam Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8295182/8169683/yoon-2768404-small.gif","p":["Yeonam Yoon (S\u201917) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2004 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2017.","He held internship position at Freescale Semiconductor, Tempe, AZ, USA.

In order to avoid these limitations, a 13-b 1 pF-10 nF generic CDC is presented. In the proposed CDC with the oversampled \u0394\u03a3 modulation, the zero-crossing-based circuits (ZCBCs) are used to replace the operational transconductance amplifier to avoid feedback loop stability issues. However, the ZCBCs inevitably incur the non-idealities and thus, a novel calibration scheme is presented for efficient non-ideality-error cancellation. In addition, for the purpose of making the proposed CDC sufficiently intelligent to adapt to a wide capacitance-sensing range, an adaptive auto-range mechanism is proposed. The above three techniques complement each other and work as a whole leading to the proposed CDC with wide range, high resolution, high linearity, and low power consumption. A prototype fabricated using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology is experimentally verified using a MEMS capacitive humidity sensor. The measurement results show that the CDC achieves a 13-b root-mean-square noise equivalent resolution with a 128-\u03bcs conversion time and a 230 fJ/conversion-step figure of merit. The calibration scheme enhances the linearity from 7 to 11.4 b in the 1 pF-10 nF compatible capacitance range.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2777872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08169686.pdf","startPage":"2169","endPage":"2182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2777872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1 pF-to-10 nF Generic Capacitance-to-Digital Converter Using Zero-Crossing - Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"A 1 pF-to-10 nF Generic Capacitance-to-Digital Converter Using Zero-Crossing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta\\Sigma$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169686/","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17801679","htmlLink":"/document/8169686/","volume":"65","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61504086"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2016A030310057"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Development Funds","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150626090521275"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen University","grantNumber":"827000098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1 pF-to-10 nF Generic Capacitance-to-Digital Converter Using Zero-Crossing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta\\Sigma$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ye-2777872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113798S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8169686","onlineDate":"07 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169748,"authors":[{"name":"Mathis Steichen","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, SnT, Kennedy, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Mathis","lastName":"Steichen","id":"37085436125"},{"name":"Stefan Hommes","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, SnT, Kennedy, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Hommes","id":"38246866600"},{"name":"Radu State","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, SnT, Kennedy, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"State","id":"37324235900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1322-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1323-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8169748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1376},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169748","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Bitcoin","Synchronization","Servers","Feature extraction","Computer crime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","data privacy","firewalls","Internet","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain applications","public blockchains","blockchain network","consortium blockchains","blockchain operation","blockchain nodes","ChainGuard","SDN","OpenFlow","network traffic filtering","firewall","access control functionality","flooding attacks"]}],"abstract":"Recently, blockchains have been gathering a lot of interest. Many applications can benefit from the advantages of blockchains. Nevertheless, applications with more restricted privacy or participation requirements cannot rely on public blockchains. First, the whole blockchain can be downloaded at any time, thus making the data available to the public. Second, anyone can deploy a node, join the blockchain network and take part in the consensus building process. Private and consortium blockchains promise to combine the advantages of blockchains with stricter requirements on the participating entities. This is also the reason for the comparably small number of nodes that store and extend those blockchains. However, by targeting specific nodes, an attacker can influence how consensuses are reached and possibly even halt the blockchain operation. To provide additional security to the blockchain nodes, ChainGuard utilizes SDN functionalities to filter network traffic, thus implementing a firewall for blockchain applications. ChainGuard communicates with the blockchain nodes it guards to determine which origin of the traffic is legitimate. Packets from illegitimate sources are intercepted and thus cannot have an effect on the blockchain. As is shown with experiments, ChainGuard provides access control functionality and can effectively mitigate flooding attacks from several sources at once.","doi":"10.1109/IPTCOMM.2017.8169748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTCOMM.2017.8169748","publicationTitle":"2017 Principles, Systems and Applications of IP Telecommunications (IPTComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Principles, Systems and Applications of IP Telecommunications (IPTComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123822/8169746/08169748.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ChainGuard \u2014 A firewall for blockchain applications using SDN with OpenFlow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ChainGuard \u2014 A firewall for blockchain applications using SDN with OpenFlow","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416989","htmlLink":"/document/8169748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ChainGuard \u2014 A firewall for blockchain applications using SDN with OpenFlow","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"m1570381161steichen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092904S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123822","isNumber":"8169746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123822","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8169746","articleId":"8169748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169761,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent J.

The two most important features in most, if not all, deployable use cases are low propagation loss in fiber and wide bandwidth. Indeed, the massive fiber telecommunications industry was born from simultaneous utilization of these two advantages over other signal transport means. Avionic platforms present a host of analog signal paths but the lack of long transmission distances results in a difficult case for the insertion of microwave photonics technology. That is, the penalty in noise figure when converting between the electronic and optical domain is not recouped over typical avionic transmission distances. However, the last six years have seen a rapid increase in the study of microwave photonics techniques for radio frequency (RF) interference mitigation, which does not necessarily take advantage of the low loss in fiber. Military and commercial airborne platforms might benefit from such techniques. The state of the art in photonics for RF interference mitigation is reviewed here, suggesting that a layered approach utilizing photonics, analog electronics and digital electronics has strong potential.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169761/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169761/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17416995","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Photonics for electronic inteference suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonics for electronic inteference suppression","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063997S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123823","isNumber":"8169754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123823","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8169754","articleId":"8169761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8169762,"authors":[{"name":"Elliott Grafer","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Space and Intelligence Systems, Palm Bay, FL"],"firstName":"Elliott","lastName":"Grafer","id":"37085845934"},{"name":"Charles Middleton","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Space and Intelligence Systems, Palm Bay, FL"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Middleton","id":"37403362200"},{"name":"Alex Cramer","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Space and Intelligence Systems, Palm Bay, FL"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Cramer","id":"37086024871"},{"name":"Kevin Anzalone","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Space and Intelligence Systems, Palm Bay, FL"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Anzalone","id":"37086030076"},{"name":"Richard De Salvo","affiliation":["Harris Corporation - Space and Intelligence Systems, Palm Bay, FL"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"De Salvo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6561-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6560-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6562-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8169762","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Radio frequency","Frequency conversion","Modems","Frequency modulation","Bit error rate","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave photonics","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction finding applications","radio frequency photonics","distributed gateway","access these high frequency bands","all-electronic satellite communication terminal","RF photonic frequency converters","satellite communications applications","higher data rates","higher frequency bands","higher order modulation schemes"]}],"abstract":"Satellite communications are providing higher data rates through the use of higher frequency bands and higher order modulation schemes [1].

To solve this problem with huge search space without losing generality, we introduce a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) with a particle swarm optimization based mutation function. It maintains a pre-calculated global best position for each single objective, and choose the global best position of an objective that has the best accordance to a parent to guide the mutation of the parent. Evaluations show that our MOGA can generate a pareto frontier with a larger diversity toward the given global best positions in much shorter convergence time than a general MOGA.","doi":"10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169836","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123893/8169814/08169836.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms with particle swarm optimization based mutation for distributed controller placement in SDNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms with particle swarm optimization based mutation for distributed controller placement in SDNs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17398867","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169836/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms with particle swarm optimization based mutation for distributed controller placement in SDNs","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570366964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096707S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123893","isNumber":"8169814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123893","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8169814","articleId":"8169836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8169846,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Flittner","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Flittner","id":"37085425504"},{"name":"Johannes M.

Such verification requires explicit support from the physical cloud infrastructure and - more important - relies on correct configuration and operation of the Cloud Management Platform. Therefore, we present ChainGuard, a tool that allows static verification of SFCs within a dynamic cloud environment independently from the Cloud Management Platform. As a result, a target-actual comparison between the SFC configuration and the actual SFC deployment can be run continuously and faulty SFC realizations can be unveiled. In comparison to existing work, ChainGuard independently identifies SFC relevant parts of flow tables, allows the verification of the sequence of an SFC and is evaluated for migrations of service functions (cloud-awareness).","doi":"10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169846","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123893/8169814/08169846.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ChainGuard: Controller-independent verification of service function chaining in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169846/","displayDocTitle":"ChainGuard: Controller-independent verification of service function chaining in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417120","htmlLink":"/document/8169846/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ChainGuard: Controller-independent verification of service function chaining in cloud computing","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570367723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093947S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123893","isNumber":"8169814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123893","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8169814","articleId":"8169846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8169855,"authors":[{"name":"Tejas Subramanya","affiliation":["FBK CREATE-NET., Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Tejas","lastName":"Subramanya","id":"37086137155"},{"name":"Leonardo Goratti","affiliation":["FBK CREATE-NET., Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Goratti","id":"37595187400"},{"name":"Shah Nawaz Khan","affiliation":["FBK CREATE-NET., Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Shah Nawaz","lastName":"Khan","id":"37085895501"},{"name":"Emmanouil Kafetzakis","affiliation":["Orion Innovations, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Kafetzakis","id":"37085336465"},{"name":"Ioannis Giannoulakis","affiliation":["NCSR Demokritos, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Giannoulakis","id":"37085372134"},{"name":"Roberto Riggio","affiliation":["FBK CREATE-NET., Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Riggio","id":"37391696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3285-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3286-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8169855","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1027},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169855","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Computer architecture","Long Term Evolution","Servers","Edge computing","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cache storage","mobile computing","mobile radio","radio access networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile user","resource constrained cloud-enabled small cell","content caching application","core network segments","MEC applications","mobile data path","mobile edge computing functionalities","MEC server","radio access network","processing capabilities","storage","network edge","mobile broadband networks","practical architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Mobile Edge Computing","Content Caching"]}],"abstract":"Recently, mobile broadband networks are focused on bringing additional capabilities to the network edge.

Such an efficient entity interconnection is made possible through an emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) that intends to vastly simplify policy enforcement and network reconfiguration in a dynamic manner. However, despite the obvious advantages this novel networking paradigm introduces, its increased attack surface compared to traditional networking deployments proved to be a thorny issue that creates skepticism when safety-critical applications are considered. Especially when SDN is used to support Internet-of-Things (IoT)-related networking elements, additional security concerns rise, due to the elevated vulnerability of such deployments to specific types of attacks and the necessity of inter-cloud communication any IoT application would require. The overall number of connected nodes makes the efficient monitoring of all entities a real challenge, that must be tackled to prevent system degradation and service outage. This position paper provides an overview of common security issues of SDN when linked to IoT clouds, describes the design principals of the recently introduced Blockchain paradigm and advocates the reasons that render Blockchain as a significant security factor for solutions where SDN and IoT are involved.","doi":"10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169860","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123893/8169814/08169860.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing SDN security for IoT-related deployments through blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancing SDN security for IoT-related deployments through blockchain","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417107","htmlLink":"/document/8169860/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing SDN security for IoT-related deployments through blockchain","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570383535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058561S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123893","isNumber":"8169814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123893","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8169814","articleId":"8169860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8169869,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Furthermore, as per the Virtual RAN (VRAN) approach, such functions can be virtualised (e.g., in simple terms, deployed in virtual machines). In such scenario, the fronthaul network connecting DU and CU must fulfill different latency and capacity requirements based on the selected functional split. This study experimentally evaluates in a federated testbed how the fronthaul latency budget (i.e., the latency requirement of the fronthaul network connecting DU and CU), specified by Standard Developing Organisations (SDO) (3GPP in this specific case), is impacted by virtualising some of the RAN functions. In particular, Option 7-1 (i.e., intra-PHY split) and different virtualisation methods are considered for the CU. Furthermore, it evaluates how jitter (i.e., delay variation) impacts the DU-CU communication. The obtained results show that light virtualisation methods (e.g., Docker) impact less the fronthaul latency budget than heavy virtualisation methods (e.g., VirtualBox). In addition, a maximum jitter of about 40's can be tolerated in the fronthaul.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How much is fronthaul latency budget impacted by RAN virtualisation ?","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","doi":"10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169875","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8123893/8169814/08169875.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NFV-SDN.2017.8169875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"How much is fronthaul latency budget impacted by RAN virtualisation ?","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169875/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417099","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How much is fronthaul latency budget impacted by RAN virtualisation ?","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"1570389364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059603S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8123893","isNumber":"8169814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8123893","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8169814","articleId":"8169875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8169984,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Diment","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology Laboratory of Signal Processing, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Diment","id":"37085738715"},{"name":"Tuomas Virtanen","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology Laboratory of Signal Processing, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37285488100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1632-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1631-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1633-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"8169984","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Tagging","Training","Training data","Pediatrics","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","recurrent neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weakly labelled audio","transfer learning","machine learning tasks","audio analysis","weakly labelled problem","audio data","tagging task","diverse training data","abstract knowledge","sound event tagging","recurrent neural network pretraining","classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transfer learning","tagging","weak labels","audio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169984","abstract":"Many machine learning tasks have been shown solvable with impressive levels of success given large amounts of training data and computational power. For the problems which lack data sufficient to achieve high performance, methods for transfer learning can be applied. These refer to performing the new task while having prior knowledge of the nature of the data, gained by first performing a different task, for which training data is abundant. Shown successful for other machine learning tasks, transfer learning is now investigated in audio analysis. We propose to solve the weakly labelled problem of sound event tagging with small amounts of training data by transferring the abstract knowledge about the nature of audio data from another tagging task. The proposed methods constitute pre-training of a recurrent neural network or its parts to perform one tagging task given abundant and diverse training data, and then using it or its parts for a new task of tagging sound events of different nature, for which the data is limited. Several architectures for such transfer are proposed and evaluated, showing impressive classification accuracy of 83.4% with gains of up to 20 percentage points over the baseline given as little as 36 training samples for the target task.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8169984","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08169984.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8169984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer learning of weakly labelled audio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Transfer learning of weakly labelled audio","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17417322","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8169984/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer learning of weakly labelled audio","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0021570360961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075914S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8169984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8169987,"authors":[{"name":"Naoya Takahashi","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoya","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37086312737"},{"name":"Yuki Mitsufuji","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Mitsufuji","id":"37077233900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1632-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1631-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1633-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"8169987","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":572},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Convolution","Source separation","Kernel","Training","Spectrogram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","blind source separation","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiScale multiband densenets","audio source separation","deep neural networks","instrumental spectra","densely connected convolutional network","DenseNet","up-sampling layer","block skip connection","band-dedicated dense blocks","signal-to-distortion ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","DenseNet","source separation","multi-band"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8169987","abstract":"This paper deals with the problem of audio source separation.

In addition to reporting separation performance metrics (i.e., source to distortion ratios), we also report extended short term objective intelligibility (ESTOI) scores which better predict intelligibility performance in presence of non-stationary interferers.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8169997","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125199/8169982/08169997.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8169997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low latency sound source separation using convolutional recurrent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Neural networks","Training data","Training","Source separation","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","recurrent neural nets","signal reconstruction","source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low latency sound source separation","deep neural networks","monaural sound source separation","convolutional recurrent neural network architecture","low algorithmic delay","slightly better performance","separation performance metrics","short term objective intelligibility scores","training data","CRNN architecture","feedforward DNN","long short-term memory networks","LSTM networks","time 10.0 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Source Separation","Low-latency","Deep Neural Networks","Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8169997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low latency sound source separation using convolutional recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8169997/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17417291","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low latency sound source separation using convolutional recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0151570360983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103271S","chronDate":"15-18 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125199","isNumber":"8169982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125199","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8169982","articleId":"8169997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"}]
