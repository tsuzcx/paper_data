The artificial tracking test proposed in this paper requires a shorter time than the conventional test methods and is capable of ranking materials even when such ranking cannot be made by the conventional test methods. A good correlation was found between the results of this tracking test and those of our outdoor exposure test. The increase in surface leakage current on insulators during the outdoor exposure test appeared related to the decrease in hydrophobicity of the insulator surface, and the shapes and mounting of the insulators greatly influenced their performance. Polymer insulators are highly stressed on the energized end, which should be noted particularly from the viewpoint of water absorption of the shed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080522/04080532.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1978.298128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1978.298128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4080532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Basis Study on Outdoor Insulators of Organic Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1978","displayDocTitle":"A Basis Study on Outdoor Insulators of Organic Materials","volume":"EI-13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1978","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Basis Study on Outdoor Insulators of Organic Materials","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-13-n3-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094693S","chronDate":"June  1978","isNumber":"4080522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"21","articleId":"4080532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4080547,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For the sake of completeness and in order to understand the relaxation phenomena in this liquid dielectric, this high frequency dielectric study was undertaken. In order to compare its properties with a liquid dielectric used in similar application and whose high frequency behavior has been quite well analyzed, Arochlor 1476 was studied. It is observed that both liquids have distributed relaxation times. The distribution parameters together with the two distinct relaxation times have been calculated by measuring the average relaxation time. It has been found that the distinct relaxation times thus calculated represent the dielectric behavior quite satisfactorily. The average dipole moments, dipole radii and thermal activation energies for dipole relaxation have also been evaluated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080622/04080627.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1979.298213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1979.298213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4080627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the High Frequency Dielectric Behavior of Castor Oil","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1979","displayDocTitle":"On the High Frequency Dielectric Behavior of Castor Oil","volume":"EI-14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1979","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the High Frequency Dielectric Behavior of Castor Oil","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-14-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039626S","chronDate":"June  1979","isNumber":"4080622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4080627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4080720,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshio Inuishi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Inuishi","id":"37297929500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9367"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-962X"}],"articleNumber":"4080720","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society","url":"http://tdei.sju.edu/deis/deishp.html"}],"doi":"10.1109/TEI.1980.298305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080714/04080720.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"151","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04080720.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1980.298305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Field Conduction and Breakdown in Solid Dielectrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4080720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080720/","displayDocTitle":"High Field Conduction and Breakdown in Solid Dielectrics","volume":"EI-15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Field Conduction and Breakdown in Solid Dielectrics","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-15-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031389S","chronDate":"June  1980","isNumber":"4080714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"27","articleId":"4080720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4080850,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In a first approach, simple models, the inverse-power law and the exponential, are considered for electrical aging; they are combined with the Arrhenius model to find the life equation of insulating materials under temperature and voltage. This equation is discussed and the corresponding surface studied and drawn. Since experimental results often disagree with these models in the low-stress range, an improved electrical model is proposed in which a threshold electrical gradient is introduced. This also involves the introduction of a threshold temperature, variable with electrical stress. Using some simple assumptions about the thresholds, it is possible to attain a new model for insulation life under combined stresses, perfectly symmetrical in thermal and electrical stress. The results of both voltage endurance tests on various insulating materials and multiple stress tests on a composite material agree with the proposed model and show its capability by accurately predicting the longtermerm behavior of insulation.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1981.298361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080847/04080850.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1981.298361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1981","displayDocTitle":"A General Approach to the Endurance of Electrical Insulation under Temperature and Voltage","volume":"EI-16","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1981","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080850/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Approach to the Endurance of Electrical Insulation under Temperature and Voltage","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-16-n4-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0376S","chronDate":"Aug.  1981","isNumber":"4080847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"130","articleId":"4080850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":4080869,"authors":[{"name":"D.

UWB detection also embodies additional advantages such as facilitating the location of discharge sites and the rejection of external electrical noise. For discharge detection in plastic-insulated cables, true UWB detection is not practical because of frequency-dependent attenuation effects, although certain gains in sensitivity can be achieved with a detector bandwidth of up to 10 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1982.298548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080924/04080933.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1982.298548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limitations in the Measurement of Corona and Partial Discharge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4080933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080933/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limitations in the Measurement of Corona and Partial Discharge","volume":"EI-17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limitations in the Measurement of Corona and Partial Discharge","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-17-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042982S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"4080924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"147","articleId":"4080933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4080938,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The source of the collected charge may be in close proximity to, and hence greatly influenced by, the surface. Alternately, the source may be remote so that it releases charge independent of the surface accumulation. For the latter arrangement, charge transport through the gas greatly influences where it is collected. Surface charging is desired in some situations, such as for producing images or for processing. Charging is undesirable and hazardous in other situations; for example, where electrical failure may be triggered. A third possibility makes use of surface charge collection as a diagnostic procedure for materials and transport studies. This paper is concerned with the basic production and accumulation of surface charges from the adjacent gas and presents results on the processes involved. Transport parameters of drift, diffusion, and spacecharge effects are considered. Examples of charging and measured distribution under different conditions, including saturation effects, are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1982.298553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4080924/04080938.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1982.298553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4080924","startPage":"172","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Charging of Insulator Surfaces by Ionization and Transport in Gases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4080938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Charging of Insulator Surfaces by Ionization and Transport in Gases","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4080938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","isJournal":true,"volume":"EI-17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1982","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charging of Insulator Surfaces by Ionization and Transport in Gases","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-17-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028934S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"4080924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"81","articleId":"4080938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4080987,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The additives can be considered as weak electrolytes. The rate of their dissociation into positive and negative charge carriers which causes an increase in conductivity is field dependent. A model for the behavior of the additives which leads to the lowering of the electrical stress at sites of high and divergent electrical stresses is given. Presently available experimental results are in good agreement with our proposed theory. Other factors affecting this mechanism are also discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mechanism of Treeing Inhibition by Additives in Polyethylene","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1982.298530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4081012/04081026.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1982.298530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4081026","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4081026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"On the Mechanism of Treeing Inhibition by Additives in Polyethylene","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EI-17","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mechanism of Treeing Inhibition by Additives in Polyethylene","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-17-n6-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039443S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"4081012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4081026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4081039,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This has been done in point-plane geometries and semi-uniform fields in a transformer oil alone as well as with pressboard barriers. Velocities and MVP have also been measured for streamers propagating on the surface between cylindrical electrodes perpendicular to insulating sheets having a ground plane on the opposite side. Again the influence of superimposed dc was assessed. The solid materials used were polymethylmethacrylate and pressboard. Measurements with the latter material were made using an optical multichannel analyzer to follow the light emission from the propagating streamer. In most cases both streamer velocities and MVP depend upon the arithmetic sum of the step and dc voltages. With pressboard, however, marked departures from the additivity rule were found for positive streamers. These results will be discussed in terms of space charge due to the dc potential.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1983.298576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4081036/04081039.pdf","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Influence of a Dc Bias on Streamers Produced by Step Voltages in Transformer Oil and over Solid-Liquid Interfaces","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1983.298576","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4081039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1983","displayDocTitle":"The Influence of a Dc Bias on Streamers Produced by Step Voltages in Transformer Oil and over Solid-Liquid Interfaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4081039/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"EI-18","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Influence of a Dc Bias on Streamers Produced by Step Voltages in Transformer Oil and over Solid-Liquid Interfaces","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-18-n1-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024829S","chronDate":"Feb.  1983","isNumber":"4081036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4081039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4081085,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, in the gap range from 0.04 mm to 0.002 mm, the field emission current was maintained at about a constant value.

In this paper, recent topics and their important results will be reviewed on electrical conduction and related problems including carrier traps and electrical breakdown in various polymers. At first, the electronic nature, e.g. photoconduction and electron transport are explained in insulating, semi-insulating, and conducting polymers. Also, interfacial phenomena at both metal-polymer and polymer-polymer interfaces, carrier traps (their physico-chemical nature) and impurity effects on electrical conduction are introduced with their results and experimental techniques. Finally, interesting topics on electrical breakdown related to polymer morphology will be given.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1984.298741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4081220/04081224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1984.298741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081220","startPage":"162","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Conduction and Carrier Traps in Polymeric Materials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4081224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Conduction and Carrier Traps in Polymeric Materials","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4081224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"EI-19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1984","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Conduction and Carrier Traps in Polymeric Materials","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-19-n3-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06789S","chronDate":"June  1984","isNumber":"4081220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"205","articleId":"4081224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4081236,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A key parameter is the overvoltage at breakdown, determined for time-dependent voltages by the rate of rise of voltage and the statistical time lag. Two distinct types of discharge have been identified, named \"Townsendlike\" and \"streamerlike\", and mechanisms responsible for their development have been proposed. The relationship between current-time pulse shapes as well as discharge magnitudes (charge per discharge) and various parameters such as overvoltage, void size, and dielectric thickness and permittivity have been explored. The conditions governing the transition between the two types of partial discharges have been examined quantitatively. The relationship between streamer propagation and Lichtenberg figure development has been studied. Measurements of statistical time lags for partial discharges have been made and significant paramters examined. The usefulness of these results in connection with future studies of chemical degradation of insulating materials are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1984.298770","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4081268/04081277.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1984.298770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","startPage":"475","endPage":"495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 1984 J.

The algorithm was based on a modified charge-simulation technique to satisfy a better matching of the boundary conditions to the electrode and insulator surfaces involved in the HV installation.

The practical significance of pseudoglow discharges in relation to corona measuring techniques, utilizing conventional pulse discharge detectors, are considered both on a short-and long-term test basis.","doi":"10.1109/TEI.1971.299156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/14/4081635/04081640.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEI.1971.299156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1971","displayDocTitle":"Some Observations on the Character of Corona Discharges in Short Gap Spaces","volume":"EI-6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"June 1971","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4081640/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Observations on the Character of Corona Discharges in Short Gap Spaces","sourcePdf":"TEI-vEI-6-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032647S","chronDate":"June  1971","isNumber":"4081635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"64","articleId":"4081640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4081726,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The measurements reveal significant differences between the field and charge behavior under short pulse (microsecond) voltage conditions, during prolonged dc operation, after sudden changes in the dc voltage level and polarity, and, for the first time, at various intervals over the course of entire cycles of sinusoidal voltage. The results show that space-charge distortion in the interelectrode field is influenced by the level, frequency, and duration of applied voltage.

A tactile television system has permitted blind subjects to determine the position, size, shape, and orientation of visible objects and to track moving targets. The system comprises 1) a vidicon camera utilizing a zoom lens, 2) a digital switching matrix to sequentially connect each element of the photocathode surface through a single video amplifier and signal conditioner to each of the 3) 400 tactile stimulators in a 20 \u00d7 20 matrix in contact with a 10-inch square of skin. This image-projector matrix impresses on the skin a two-dimensional vibrating facsimile of either the silhouette or the outline of a visible object. The single-channel swept system exhibits inherent economies when a great number of picture elements is to be processed. Since the fovea of the human eye subserving the central two degrees of detailed vision is comprised of cone cells in a matrix about 200 receptors across, the present 20-line system permits picture transmission with a linear resolution about one-tenth that of the fovea, and has proved adequate for the recognition of human faces. Calculations indicate that the input capacity of the skin of the trunk should compare favorably with that of the fovea. We have determined the electrical-stimulus parameters for painless stimulation of the sensation of mechanical vibration with small electrodes in a closely spaced matrix.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Man-Machine Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4081845/4081917/04081932.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Man-Machine Systems","doi":"10.1109/TMMS.1970.299964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMMS.1970.299964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4081917","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4081932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tactile Television - Mechanical and Electrical Image Projection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Skin","Humans","Shape","Target tracking","Digital cameras","Lenses","Cathodes","Facsimile","Face recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4081932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1970","displayDocTitle":"Tactile Television - Mechanical and Electrical Image Projection","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1970","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tactile Television - Mechanical and Electrical Image Projection","sourcePdf":"TMMS-v11-n1-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051241S","chronDate":"March  1970","isNumber":"4081917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4081845","citationCount":"81","articleId":"4081932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4082027,"authors":[{"name":"Richard S.

We introduce the concept of subjective probability distribution to permit encoding prior knowledge about the uncertainty in the process. The expected value of clairvoyance is computed as an upper bound to the value of any experimental program.

The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1966.300074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082056/04082064.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1966.300074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Value Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Information Value Theory","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Value Theory","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v2-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024635S","chronDate":"Aug.  1966","isNumber":"4082056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"411","articleId":"4082064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4082068,"authors":[{"name":"Roy E.

The optimization is performed by the methods of policy iteration or linear programming and achieves minimization of the cost per unit-time of 1) the cost of output quality, 2) the sampling cost, and 3) the cost of exercising control. The class of processes to be controlled are assumed to shift from higher to lower quality levels according to a discrete or a discretely approximated continuous probability law. The shift is irreversible unless outside influence, called corrective action, is exercised; it may be time dependent when the process is said to have an aging failure characteristic. The control system studied is a sampling plan which bases the decision of whether or not to take corrective action on a sampled history of fixed maximum duration. This plan yields an nth order Markov chain which is converted to a first-order chain by state definition. The transition probabilities are Bayesian estimates based on a geometric prior probability distribution and a multinomial sample probability distribution.

In games or control problems a forcing state is one from which the final goal can always be reached, regardless of what disturbances may arise. A program that learns forcing states in a class of games (in a game-independent format) by working backwards from a previous loss has been written. The class of positions that ultimately results in the opponent's win is learned by the program (using a specially designed description language) and stored in its memory together with the correct move to be made when this pattern reoccurs. These patterns are searched for during future plays of the game. If they are formed by the opponent, the learning program blocks them before the opponent's win sequence can begin. If it forms the patterns first, the learning program initiates the win sequence. The class of games for which the program is effective includes Qubic, Go-Moku, Hex, and the Shannon network games, including Bridge-it. The description language enables the learning program to generalize from one example of a forcing state to all other configurations that are strategically equivalent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1968","publicationDate":"March 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning Games through Pattern Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Games through Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n1-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053262S","chronDate":"March  1968","isNumber":"4082106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4082111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4082112,"authors":[{"name":"Warne M.

Both sequential and nonsequential procedures were formulated; the resulting models are functionally analogous to a generalized Bayes'-net type of pattern recognizer or decision maker for stochastic processes, differing from usual Bayes' nets in their actual mathematical or circuit configurations and size-determining factors. It is to be noted that for ergodic processes (or approximations thereto), the procedure, if it can be applied, is nonparametric, i.e., not dependent upon prior or explicit knowledge of the form of the probability distribution governing the behavior of the stochastic process. The applicability of the resulting system to problems in cybernetics, intelligence, and learning was discussed previously. The present paper summarizes the results of a subsequent analytical investigation which included a digital simulation of the procedure. Emphasis is on the aspects of realizability, convergence, and applicability of the method with regard to 1) the classes of stochastic inputs for which the procedure is valid, and 2) the parameters of those processes. A Wiener or Wiener-derived white-noise process is used as the bench mark process here. Based on the results of the analysis, the introduction of certain preprocessors to extend the applicability of the procedure are suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082114/","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1968","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Applicability of Wiener's Canonical Expansions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Applicability of Wiener's Canonical Expansions","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052639S","chronDate":"March  1968","isNumber":"4082106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4082114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4082128,"authors":[{"name":"Peter E.

Unusual features of the discipline are the treatment of uncertainty through subjective probability and of attitude toward risk through utility theory. Capturing the structure of problem relationships occupies a central position; the process can be visualized in a graphical problem space. These features are combined with other preference measures to produce a useful conceptual model for analyzing decisions, the decision analysis cycle. In its three phases-deterministic, probabilistic, and informational-the cycle progressively determines the importance of variables in deterministic, probabilistic, and economic environments. The ability to assign an economic value to the complete or partial elimination of uncertainty through experimentation is a particularly important characteristic. Recent applications in business and government indicate that the increased logical scope afforded by decision analysis offers new opportunities for rationality to those who wish it.","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1968.300115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082145/04082150.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Foundations of Decision Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1968","displayDocTitle":"The Foundations of Decision Analysis","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Foundations of Decision Analysis","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042482S","chronDate":"Sept.  1968","isNumber":"4082145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"150","articleId":"4082150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4082152,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin T.

Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called \"subjectiveness\") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional \"direct probability\" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an \"invariant measure\" on the parameter space.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082145/04082152.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1968.300117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300117","startPage":"227","endPage":"241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prior Probabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082152/","displayDocTitle":"Prior Probabilities","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prior Probabilities","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041042S","chronDate":"Sept.  1968","isNumber":"4082145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"1061","articleId":"4082152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4082154,"authors":[{"name":"Ward Edwards","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ward","lastName":"Edwards","id":"38047002300"},{"name":"Lawrence D.

Men estimate likelihood ratios for each datum and each pair of hypotheses under consideration or a sufficient subset of these pairs. A computer aggregates these estimates by means of Bayes' theorem of probability theory into a posterior distribution that reflects the impact of all available data on all hypotheses being considered. Such a system circumvents human conservatism in information processing, the inability of men to aggregate information in such a way as to modify their opinions as much as the available data justify. It also fragments the job of evaluating diagnostic information into small separable tasks. The posterior distributions that are a PIP's output may be used as a guide to human decision making or may be combined with a payoff matrix to make decisions by means of the principle of maximizing expected value. A large simulation-type experiment compared a PIP with three other information processing systems in a simulated strategic war setting of the 1970's. The difference between PIP and its competitors was that in PIP the information was aggregated by computer, while in the other three systems, the operators aggregated the information in their heads. PIP processed the information dramatically more efficiently than did any competitor. Data that would lead PIP to give 99:1 odds in favor of a hypothesis led the next best system to give 4\u00bd: 1 odds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1968","publicationDate":"Sept. 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Information Processing Systems: Design and Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Information Processing Systems: Design and Evaluation","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n3-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033465S","chronDate":"Sept.  1968","isNumber":"4082145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4082154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4082157,"authors":[{"name":"Carl S.

This paper describes how such a utility function was evolved as a risk policy for capital investment decisions. First, 36 corporate executives were interviewed and their risk attitudes were quantified. From the responses of the interviewees, a mathematical function was developed that could reflect each interviewee's attitude. The fit of the function was tested by checking the reaction of the interviewees to adjusted responses. The functional form that led the interviewees to prefer the adjusted responses to their initial responses was finally accepted. The mathematical form of the function was considered a flexible pattern for a risk policy. The assumption was made that the corporate risk policy would be of this pattern. With the pattern for a risk policy set, it was possible to simplify the method of deriving a particular individual's risk attitude. Using the simplified method, the corporate policy makers were interviewed once more. The results from these interviews were then used as a starting point in two negotiation sessions. As a result of these negotiation sessions, the policy makers agreed on a risk policy for trial purposes. They also agreed to develop a number of major projects using the concepts of risk analysis and the certainty equivalent.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082145/04082157.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1968.300122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1968.300122","startPage":"279","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Development of a Corporate Risk Policy for Capital Investment Decisions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082157/","displayDocTitle":"The Development of a Corporate Risk Policy for Capital Investment Decisions","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Development of a Corporate Risk Policy for Capital Investment Decisions","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v4-n3-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031217S","chronDate":"Sept.  1968","isNumber":"4082145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4082157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4082161,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

A performance index for evaluating the rate of convergence of the algorithm is defined and then the optimal form of the algorithm is derived. It is shown that the least-square-error fit of the measured output signals of the systems offers a recursive formula which is a special case of the proposed algorithm. A recursive formula for estimation of a priori probabilities of the pattern classes using unclassified samples is then presented. The rate of convergence is computed.

The inverse algorithm generates a system composed of a differentiation system cascaded with a dynamical system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082192/04082202.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1969.300243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1969.300243","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Inverse of Linear Dynamical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082202/","displayDocTitle":"On the Inverse of Linear Dynamical Systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Inverse of Linear Dynamical Systems","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v5-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021426S","chronDate":"Jan.  1969","isNumber":"4082192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"38","articleId":"4082202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4082206,"authors":[{"name":"Herbert Freeman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, New York University, Bronx, N.Y. 10453"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Freeman"},{"name":"Jeremy M.

The criterion provides a guide for selecting the quantization fineness required to assure that the significant features of given line-drawing data will be preserved in the quantization process. The criterion is based on viewing a line drawing as an elastic beam under flexure and selecting a quantization grid size that is fine enough to permit the line drawing to be represented by a beam of minimum strain energy. In this model, regions of sharp curvature of the line drawing correspond to regions of high strain-energy density of the elastic beam. The smoothest possible curve that can be reconstructed from a quantized representation is the minimum-energy curve that satisfies the constraints of the quantized data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1969","publicationDate":"Jan. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Quantization of Line-Drawing Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Quantization of Line-Drawing Data","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v5-n1-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044473S","chronDate":"Jan.  1969","isNumber":"4082192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"45","articleId":"4082206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4082208,"authors":[{"name":"Sid Deutsch","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sid","lastName":"Deutsch","id":"37301494300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0536-1567"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2887"}],"articleNumber":"4082208","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4082208","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nerve fibers","Optical fiber cables","Capacitance","Coaxial cables","Conductors","Velocity measurement","Muscles","Delay effects","Geometry","Loss measurement"]}],"abstract":"Histological and electrical examination of high-speed (myelinated) nerve fibers reveals a coaxial RC cable whose inner conductor has from 40 to 80 percent of the diameter of the outer conductor.

These models incorporate mechanisms that optimize response patterns on algorithmic and heuristic bases; make abstractions at different levels; produce value judgements; recognize, modify, store, and retrieve geometrical patterns; and exhibit, in general, many aspects of intelligent behavior. Both the teacher and the learner are simulated in the machine. In one model, the program follows a qualitatively new kind of learning process in generating its own strategy and improving it on the basis of experience. The method enables the learner to exceed the playing quality of the teacher.

Results are given in terms of a figure-of-merit which measures the deviation between the original patterns and the patterns reconstructed from the automatically derived feature set.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082254/04082259.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1969.300219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1969.300219","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Extraction on Binary Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082259/","displayDocTitle":"Feature Extraction on Binary Patterns","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Extraction on Binary Patterns","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v5-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059022S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4082254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"21","articleId":"4082259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4082260,"authors":[{"name":"Jack R.

The laissez-faire approach is giving way to a disciplined approach characterized by rigorous definition of the test plan, systematic control of the test effort, and objective quantitative measurement of the test coverage. This paper describes just such a disciplined test control process, which is composed of five steps: 1) the survey, which establishes the intended extent of testing; 2) the identification, which creates a list of functional variations eligible for testing; 3) the appraisal, which ranks and subsets the eligible variations so that test resources can be directed at those with the higher payoff; 4) the review, which calculates the test coverage of the test case library; and 5) the monitor, which verifies attainment of the planned test coverage. Throughout the test process, specification testing is distinguished from program testing.","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1969.300221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082254/04082261.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1969.300221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling the Functional Testing of an Operating System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","displayDocTitle":"Controlling the Functional Testing of an Operating System","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling the Functional Testing of an Operating System","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v5-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047767S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4082254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4082261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4082265,"authors":[{"name":"Kunihiko Fukushima","affiliation":["NHK Broadcasting Science Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunihiko","lastName":"Fukushima","id":"37069131900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0536-1567"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2887"}],"articleNumber":"4082265","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4082265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Network synthesis","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Biology computing","Computer networks","Character recognition","Handwriting recognition","Biological systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1969.300225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082254/04082265.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1969.300225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Feature Extraction by a Multilayered Network of Analog Threshold Elements","abstract":"A new type of visual feature extracting network has been synthesized, and the response of the network has been simulated on a digital computer.

The design of the network was suggested by biological systems, especially, the visual systems of cat and monkey. The network is composed of analog threshold elements connected in layers. Each analog threshold element receives inputs from a large number of elements in the neighbouring layers and performs its own special functions. It takes care of one restricted part of the photoreceptor layer, on which an input pattem is presented, and it responds to one particular feature of the input pattem, such as brightness contrast, a dot in the pattern, a line segment of a particular orientation, or an end of the line. This means that the network performs parallel processing of the information. With the propagation of the information through the layered network, the input pattern is successively decomposed into dots, groups of line segments of the same orientation, and the ends of these line segments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Visual Feature Extraction by a Multilayered Network of Analog Threshold Elements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Feature Extraction by a Multilayered Network of Analog Threshold Elements","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v5-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051852S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4082254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4082265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4082266,"authors":[{"name":"Roger C.

Consideration is given to a number of possible automata structures, linear and nonlinear. One particular linear model is derived with optimal rather than expedient properties of convergence. A basic feature of this model is that it is based on a system response set of rewards and inactions, the latter being substituted for the more common penalty responses. This choice of response set is directly related to the achievement of the desired behavior. Simulations are described for the maximization of multimodal performance functions intentionally constructed to demonstrate the use of the method in situations where relative extrema occur.

Computation of the estimate requires knowledge of the data correlation matrix. Algorithms have been proposed by Griffiths [9] and by Widrow [7] for iterative determination of the estimate of each element from a sequence of scalar random variables given an observation of the corresponding element from a sequence of date vectors when the data correlation matrix is not known. These algorithms are easy to implement, require little storage, and are suitable for real-time processing. Past convergence studies of these algorithms have assumed that the data vectors were mutually independent. In this study some asymptotic properties of these and other related algorithms are derived for a sequence of mutually correlated data vectors. A generalized algorithm is defined for analytic purposes. It is demonstrated for this generalized algorithm that excess mean-square error (as defined by Widrow) can be made arbitrarily small for large values of time in the correlated case. The analysis can be applied to a particular estimation scheme of 1) the particular algorithm can be placed in the generalized form, and 2) the given assumptions are satisfied. The analysis of the generalized algorithm requires that the data vectors possess only a few properties; foremost among these are ergodicity and a form of asymptotic independence.

The method does not require the incorporation of a physical model for generation of the model response. In some cases, it is not required to know the nonlinearity in explicit analytical form but just the graphical form is enough.

Different from other linear classifiers, this one maintains the maximum reliability of its operation, provided that the set of pattern vectors is linearly separable. A procedure of deriving an optimum structure of the linear classifier for a change in the set of input vectors is a modification of the ordinary simplex method and yields an optimum structure in much fewer iterations than the straightforward application of the ordinary simplex method does. The adaptive procedure is then extended to the case in which a linear classifier maintains the minimum number of erroneously classified input vectors even if the set of input pattern vectors is not linearly separable. This is based on Gomory's algorithm for integer linear programming. The feasibility and efficiency of these linear classifiers are computationally proved by some examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082276/04082287.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1970.300329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1970.300329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4082287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Linear Classifier by Linear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Vectors","Pattern recognition","Integer linear programming","Maintenance","Neural networks","Mathematics","Physics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Linear Classifier by Linear Programming","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Linear Classifier by Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v6-n1-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043661S","chronDate":"Jan.  1970","isNumber":"4082276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"22","articleId":"4082287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-08"},{"_id":4082306,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas B.

These permit the design of revised policies to improve the behavior of the systems within which we live. Industrial dynamics relates system structure to behavior. Industrial dynamics belongs to the same general subject area as feedback systems, servomechanisms theory, and cybernetics. Industrial dynamics is the study of how the feedback loop structure of a system produces the dynamic behavior of that system. In managerial terms industrial dynamics makes possible the structuring of the components and policies of a system to show how the resulting dynamic behavior is produced. In terms of social systems it deals with the forces that arise within a system to cause changes through time. The structure of an urban area has been organized into a system model to show the life cycle dynamics of urban growth and decay. The results suggest that most of today's popular urban policies lie between neutral and detrimental in their effectiveness. Quite different policies are suggested when one comes to an understanding of why urban areas evolve as they do.

The simulation is used as an off-line model of the process to design an endpoint control system which makes use of the available feedback from the process. Feedback consists of previously existing instrumentation for effluent gas analysis and an instrument designed for quick carbon analysis. The same instrument, independently conceived by Bethlehem Steel, has been proved effective by them. The control system uses Bayesian inference to evaluate process feedback optimally. Equations have been developed and a computational algorithm designed enabling real-time calculation of the probability of a carbon-temperature state given any control action and imperfect measurements. Because the objective function is almost symmetric and the cost of control is minimal compared to the value of an endpoint state, optimal control drives the expected state vector to the center of the tolerance region.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4082335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4082035/4082335/04082351.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSSC.1970.300311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSSC.1970.300311","startPage":"339","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Use of Bayesian Inference in the Design of an Endpoint Control System for the Basic Oxygen Steel Furnace","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4082351/","displayDocTitle":"The Use of Bayesian Inference in the Design of an Endpoint Control System for the Basic Oxygen Steel Furnace","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Bayesian Inference in the Design of an Endpoint Control System for the Basic Oxygen Steel Furnace","sourcePdf":"TSSC-v6-n4-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029291S","chronDate":"Oct.  1970","isNumber":"4082335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4082035","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4082351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084200,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This analysis uses shifted electromagnetic fields to simulate the velocity effects associated with such motion (akin to EMAP3D [1]). Specifically, the velocity effects are produced by the shift of the magnetic vector and scalar potential fields, the temperature and structural fields, and the respective element material attributes. The cylindrical symmetry of the model allows us to employ 3D finite element bricks. These have an advantage over tetrahedral elements by allowing very high aspect ratios to model longer stretches of the problem not in the immediate vicinity of the armature or the end of the rails, with a minimal number of elements, thereby reducing both the model size and the required computational time. The armature motion is calculated self-consistently from the electromagnetic forces on the armature; however, the armature is stationary. Instead the electromagnetic, thermal and structural degrees of freedom, as well as the element material attributes of the non-armature components of the model are shifted to simulate the motion. It is these other non-armature components that move but in the direction opposite to the actual armature motion. The method has been verified for electromagnetic velocity effects using several simple modified textbook cases of closed wire loops moving through either uniform or spatially dependent magnetic fields. In both cases the agreement between the ANSYS and analytical results was very good. In addition, the model has been verified against published EMAP3D coupled electromagnetic railgun results with good agreement. Using ANSYS has many benefits. ANSYS is commercially available, validated and maintained. Further it has fully developed pre and post processors, multi-elements, and multiple field types that can be readily coupled requiring no further user development. Moreover, ANSYS is being continuously improved and updated and comes equipped with full technical support. In addition, the user can add more physics via a relatively straightforward Fortran-like scripting language.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of Dynamic Armature Motion in a Railgun with Coupling of Electromagnetic, Thermal and Structural Effects Using Shifted Finite Element Fields","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","doi":"10.1109/PPC.2005.300590","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084140/4084141/04084200.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPC.2005.300590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Dynamic Armature Motion in a Railgun with Coupling of Electromagnetic, Thermal and Structural Effects Using Shifted Finite Element Fields","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084200/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"10235980","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Dynamic Armature Motion in a Railgun with Coupling of Electromagnetic, Thermal and Structural Effects Using Shifted Finite Element Fields","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PPC-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049852S","chronDate":"13-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084140","isNumber":"4084141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084140","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4084141","articleId":"4084200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4084312,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This modification will associate to the present vacuum line, a new element that will increase the radius of the internal conductor and decrease the radius of the external conductor to the dimensions of the future LTD generator line. Also it will increase the length of the line to study with more details the MITL behavior. To design this new element and optimize the different dimensions, PIC simulations with the LSP code were used. They permit to control magnetic insulation by taking into account the electronic current flow along the internal conductor and to show the effects of this addition on the Marx bank. In this paper, the design of this additional element and the different simulation results are presented. Also, the different diagnostics needed to characterize the power transmission and the magnetically insulation are specified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2005","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","accessionNumber":"10236092","publicationDate":"June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4084312/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Vacuum Coaxial Line for Ast\u00e9rix to Study the Behavior of a MITL at High Voltage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Vacuum Coaxial Line for Ast\u00e9rix to Study the Behavior of a MITL at High Voltage","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PPC-00-171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045841S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084140","isNumber":"4084141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084140","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4084141","articleId":"4084312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4084329,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Twelve IGBTs are connected in series in each IGBT to increase voltage rating of the pulse generator. Each IGBT stack uses a very simple driving method that has only two active drivers and eleven passive drivers (are composed of passive components such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes). Fault detection and fast protection are critical parts of the pulse power generator. The arc generation in the plasma load is common. Due to the arc in the plasma load, short current (overcurrent) condition is often generated.

Buried ridge stripe (BRS)-type single-mode distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are also demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) as high as 45 dB. Such DFB lasers allow the first floor-free 10-Gb/s direct modulation for back-to-back and transmission over 16-km standard optical fiber. In addition, novel results are given on gain, noise, and four-wave mixing of QD-based semiconductor optical amplifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that QD Fabry-Perot (FP) lasers, owing to the small confinement factor and the three-dimensional (3-D) quantification of electronic energy levels, exhibit a beating linewidth as narrow as 15 kHz. Such an extremely narrow linewidth, compared to their QW or bulk counterparts, leads to the excellent phase noise and time-jitter characteristics when QD lasers are actively mode-locked.

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation.

In this paper, a new solution is proposed. The key idea is to divide the global full-constraining task into several subtasks, which can be applied or inactivated to take into account potential constraints of the environment. Far from any constraint, the robot moves according to the full task. When it comes closer to a configuration to avoid, a higher level controller removes one or several subtasks, and activates them again when the constraint is avoided. The last controller ensures the convergence at the global level by introducing some look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is reached. The robot accomplishes the global task by automatically sequencing sensor-based tasks, obstacle avoidance, and short deliberative phases. In this paper, a complete solution to implement this idea is proposed, along with several experiments that prove the validity of this approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Automatic control","Robotics and automation","Visual servoing","Motion control","Uncertainty","Path planning","Motion planning","Redundancy","Robot control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","motion control","sequences","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task sequencing","high-level sensor-based control","obstacle avoidance","robot motion control","visual servoing","path planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Avoidance","planning","redundancy","sensor-based control","tasks sequencing","visual servoing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRO.2006.889487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4084555/04084570.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2006.889487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Sequencing for High-Level Sensor-Based Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Task Sequencing for High-Level Sensor-Based Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084570/","volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084570/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9292589","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Sequencing for High-Level Sensor-Based Control","sourcePdf":"23tro01-mansard.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07932S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4084555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4084555","articleId":"4084570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4084578,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Yershova","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Yershova","id":"37279796700"},{"name":"Steven M.

The underlying goal of the study is to pursue the minimum system temperature design of MCMs containing a number of chips of equal and/or unequal power through the optimal chip placement design. To deal with the thermal design problems, an effective indirect optimization approach that integrates a modified force-directed (FD) thermal model, a finite-element (FE) technique and an exterior penalty method (EPM) is proposed. In the modified FD thermal model, a novel representation of the repulsive and attractive forces is proposed, and the sum of these forces in the design system, representing the total system chip junction temperature, constructs the objective of the optimization problems. Together with some geometry constraints, the constrained optimization problems are formed, and furthermore, transformed into unconstrained optimization problems using an EPM. The solution of the optimization problems is sought through a direct, iterative search scheme with two proposed placement strategies. The alternative goal of the study is to address the feature and feasibility of these two proposed placement strategies for the current problems. The applicability of the proposed optimization approach is demonstrated through several design applications, and their results are extensively compared against the published data.

Global motion in video sequences is more complex and involves camera operation, camera motion, and other nontarget motions. Global motion compensation is usually handled by compensating the dominant motion using estimation and segmentation techniques. To enhance tracker performance and accuracy, frame recovery operation plays a crucial role by estimating undesired motion. In this paper, a normalized correlation-based regional template-matching (TM) algorithm has been developed to accurately recover frames before the application of the tracking algorithm. Then, a robust multiple-target-tracking system has been developed using a combination of fringe-adjusted joint transform correlator and TM techniques. Joint transform correlation detects a target optoelectronically, while TM technique is performed digitally. To increase the tracking system speed and decrease the effects of clutter, a subframe segmentation and local deviation-based image-preprocessing algorithm has been proposed. The improved performance of multiple-target-tracking system is tested using real-life forward-looking infrared (IR) imagery video sequences obtained from IR sensors mounted on an airborne platform","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.885513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084638.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.885513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Multiple Target Tracking via Global Motion Compensation and Optoelectronic Correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Multiple Target Tracking via Global Motion Compensation and Optoelectronic Correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9299076","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4084638/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Multiple Target Tracking via Global Motion Compensation and Optoelectronic Correlation","sourcePdf":"54tie01-alam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062062S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084639,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Mirecki","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectrotechnique et dElectronique Industrielle, Unite Mixte de Recherche","Unite Mixte de Recherche, Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse-Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Electrotechnique, d'Electronique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084639/4084639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adam Mirecki was born in Gdynia, Poland, in 1974.

The algorithms are designed aiming minimum estimation error in both transient and steady state over a wide velocity range, including very low and persistent zero-speed operation. A major challenge at very low and zero speed is the lost coupling effect from the rotor to the stator, which makes the information on rotor variables unobservable on the stator side. As a solution to this problem, in this paper, the load torque and the rotor angular velocity are simultaneously estimated, with the velocity taken into consideration via the equation of motion and not as a constant parameter, which is commonly the case in most past studies. The estimation of load torque, on the other hand, is performed as a constant parameter to account for Coulomb and viscous friction at steady state to improve the estimation performance at very low and zero speed. The estimation algorithms developed based on the rotor and stator fluxes are experimentally tested under challenging variations and reversals of the velocity and load torque (step-type and varying linearly with velocity) over a wide velocity range and at zero speed. In all the scenarios, the current estimation error has remained within a very narrow error band, also yielding acceptable velocity estimation errors, which motivate the use of the developed estimation method in sensorless control of IMs over a wide velocity range and persistent zero-speed operation","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.885123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084641.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.885123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speed-Sensorless Estimation for Induction Motors Using Extended Kalman Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Speed-Sensorless Estimation for Induction Motors Using Extended Kalman Filters","volume":"54","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9299051","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4084641/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed-Sensorless Estimation for Induction Motors Using Extended Kalman Filters","sourcePdf":"54tie01-barut.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124504S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084642,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Rahiman Beig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engg., National Institute of Technology Suratkal Srinivasnagar, Suratkal, Karnataka, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084642/4084642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdul Rahiman Beig (M'92) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Suratkal, India, in 1989, the M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 1998 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Suratkal, India.

This is achieved by maintaining the synchronization, half-wave symmetry, quarter-wave symmetry, and three-phase symmetry in the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveforms. The principles of achieving synchronization and symmetries in terms of space vectors for three level inverters are presented. A novel synchronized space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) algorithms is proposed and verified experimentally. The experimental waveforms of the inverter output voltage and motor no load current for different operating conditions of the drive are presented. The performance measure in terms of the weighted total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line voltage is computed for the linear modulation region of the drive for the proposed algorithm and compared with that of synchronized SVPWM and synchronized sine-triangle pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) technique. The comparative results show that consideration of synchronization and symmetry results in improved THD.

Better utilization of the Microgrid is achieved by solving power flow and power quality issues using p-q theory-based active filtering called universal active power line conditioner and unified power quality conditioner, respectively. A distributed intelligent energy management system (DIEMS) is implemented to optimize operating costs. As the optimization greatly depends on the power generation and the power output from renewable sources strongly depends on the weather, the forecast of power generation is required for DIEMS. A Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to predict hourly day-type outputs based on which generation can be forecasted. Depending on the forecast, an optimization scheme is developed utilizing linear programming along with heuristics. The results obtained show the successful implementation of HFAC Microgrid with adequate power flow and power quality control, as well as the optimization of operation cost by the DIEMS with Fuzzy ARTMAP-based day-type forecasting. The improvement in the battery life is also achieved due to optimization of storage charge states using the proposed DIEMS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084646/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9299035","volume":"54","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Intelligent Energy Management System for a Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Intelligent Energy Management System for a Single-Phase High-Frequency AC Microgrid","sourcePdf":"54tie01-chakraborty.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08782S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"300","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084647,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Rui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084647/4084647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang-Rui Chen (M'05) was born in Changhua, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1971.

Since the proposed strategy uses independent on/off switching action of the upper or lower arm according to the polarity of the current, the dead time is not needed except instant of current polarity change. Therefore, it is not necessary to compensate the dead time effect and the possibility of arm short is strongly eliminated. The current control of PWM power converters can easily adopt the proposed switching strategy by using the polarity information of the reference current instead of the real current, thus eliminating the problems that commonly arise from real current detection. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed switching strategy, experimental tests were done using a single-phase inverter with passive loads, a three-phase inverter for induction motor drives, a three-phase ac/dc PWM converter, a three-phase active power filter, and a class-D amplifier, the results of which are presented in this paper","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.888793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084648.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.888793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Switching Strategy for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Power Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084648/","displayDocTitle":"A New Switching Strategy for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Power Converters","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9299056","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084648/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Switching Strategy for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Power Converters","sourcePdf":"54tie01-cho.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040398S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4084649,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Cirrincione","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Belfort Montbeliard, Belfort, France","Section of Palermo, ISSIA-CNR, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Cirrincione","id":"37278475800"},{"name":"Marcello Pucci","affiliation":["Institute on Intelligent Systems for the Automation, Section of Palermo, ISSIA-CNR, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Pucci","id":"37278459300"},{"name":"Giansalvo Cirrincione","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Giansalvo","lastName":"Cirrincione","id":"37278457400"},{"name":"Grard-Andr Capolino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Grard-Andr","lastName":"Capolino","id":"37278455700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"4084649","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":924},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensorless control","Induction machines","Neurons","Observers","Adaptive systems","Drives","Nonlinear equations","State estimation","Inverters","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","compensation","induction motor drives","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","machine vector control","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","observers","stability","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless vector control","neural algorithm","speed observers","high-performance induction motor drives","online adaptation law","total least-squares technique","TLS EXIN neuron","model reference adaptive system","online training","learning factor","neural adaptive integrator","modified Euler integration","discretization instability problem","state equations","inverter nonlinearity compensation algorithm","stator resistance","stability analysis","field-weakening region","regenerating mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field oriented control","induction motor","Luenberger observer","model reference adaptive system (MRAS)","neural networks","sensorless control","speed observers","total least-squares (TLS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084649","abstract":"This paper proposes two speed observers for high-performance induction machine drives, both adopting an online adaptation law based on a new total least-squares (TLS) technique: the TLS EXIN neuron. The first is a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observer with a neural adaptive integrator in the reference model and a neural adaptive model trained online by the TLS EXIN neuron. This observer, presented in a previous article of the authors, has been improved here in two aspects: first, the neural adaptive integrator has been modified to make its learning factor vary according to the reference speed of the drive, second, a neural adaptive model based on the modified Euler integration has been proposed to solve the discretization instability problem in field-weakening. The second observer is a new full-order adaptive one based on the state equations of the induction machine, where the speed is estimated by means of a TLS EXIN adaptation technique. Both these observers have been provided with an inverter nonlinearity compensation algorithm and with techniques for the online estimation of the stator resistance of the machine. Moreover, a thorough theoretical stability analysis has been developed for them both, with particular reference to the field-weakening region behavior for the TLS MRAS observer and to the regenerating mode at low speeds for the TLS adaptive observer. Both speed observers have been verified in numerical simulation and experimentally on a test setup, and have also been compared experimentally with the BPN MRAS observer, the classic adaptive observer and with an open-loop estimator.

It is shown that a bank of resonant filters, used as a refinement term for harmonic compensation in earlier works, is equivalent to a repetitive scheme with a particular structure.

More precisely, the repetitive scheme takes a negative feedback structure plus a feedforward path whenever the odd harmonics are considered for compensation only. The repetitive scheme, equivalent to the bank of resonant filters, acts as a refinement term to reject the harmonic distortion caused by the unbalanced and distorted load current, and thus, allowing the UPS inverter to deliver an almost pure sinusoidal balanced voltage.

The control structure is simple, but the performance is usually not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cascade control strategy for temperature control of AHU. Instead of a fixed PID controller in the classical cascade control scheme, a neural network (NN) controller is used in the outer control loop. This approach not only overcomes the tedious tuning procedure for the inner and outer loop PID parameters of a classical cascade control system, but also makes the whole control system be adaptive and robust. The multilayer NN is trained online by a special training algorithm-simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)-based training algorithm. With the SPSA-based training algorithm, the weight convergence of the NN and stability of the control system is guaranteed. The novel cascade control system has been implemented on an experimental HVAC system.

The error between the rotor flux linkages based on a neural network model and a voltage model is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network model for the rotor resistance estimation. For the stator resistance estimation, the error between the measured stator current and the estimated stator current using neural network is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network. The rotor speed is synthesized from the induction motor state equations. The performance of the stator and rotor resistance estimators and torque and flux responses of the drive, together with these estimators, are investigated with the help of simulations for variations in the stator and rotor resistances from their nominal values. Both resistances are estimated experimentally, using the proposed neural network in a vector controlled induction motor drive. Data on tracking performances of these estimators are presented. With this speed sensorless approach, the rotor resistance estimation was made insensitive to the stator resistance variations both in simulation and experiment.

The proposed converter is suitable for the low-voltage and high-current applications. The structure of the proposed converter is the same as that of the conventional active-clamp forward converter. However, since it controls the secondary synchronous switch to build up the primary current during the very short period of time, the ZVS operation is easily achieved without any additional conduction losses of magnetizing current in the transformer and clamp circuit. Furthermore, there are no additional circuits required for the ZVS operation of power switches. Therefore, the proposed converter can achieve the high efficiency and low electromagnetic-interference noise resulting from the soft switching without any additional conduction losses and shows the high power density resulting from the high efficiency and no additional components added. The operational principle and design example are presented.

Fractional-order disturbance observer has a wider range to select a suitable tradeoff between robustness and vibration suppression, because introduction of fractional calculus makes universe of relative degree of Q-filter is expanded from integer domain to real-number domain. For the single neuron-based PI fuzzy controller, a single neuron makes up a PI controller and such a controller is embedded in each cell of the fuzzy control table. Thus, the fuzzy control table is changed into a controller matrix and it constructs a nonlinear adaptive controller with parameter self-tuning property.

The three-phase flyback converter required a unique pattern of PWM to optimize the power transfer in the magnetic circuit used in the converter. The three-phase PWM is generated digitally based on uniform symmetrical sampling technique using Xilinx chip. The generated PWM pattern is able to reduce the magnitude of the low order of harmonic components present in the input ac supply. Although software simulation could simulate the PWM pattern, it does not represent the exact pattern as being generated digitally. The mathematical approach used is to model the PWM pattern exactly as being created digitally. The proposed mathematical technique could also be used to analyze any digital PWM. The result of the mathematical analysis on the PWM pattern could be used to study the characteristics of the pattern such as maximum and minimum value of duty cycle, pulsewidth, turn-on time, turn-off time, and modulation index.

harmonic distortions from an AC line is proposed. The proposed filter is completely based on Adaline neural networks which are organized in different independent blocks. We introduce a neural method based on Adalines for the online extraction of the voltage components to recover a balanced and equilibrated voltage system, and three different methods for harmonic filtering. These three methods efficiently separate the fundamental harmonic from the distortion harmonics of the measured currents. According to either the Instantaneous Power Theory or to the Fourier series analysis of the currents, each of these methods are based on a specific decomposition. The original decomposition of the currents or of the powers then allows defining the architecture and the inputs of Adaline neural networks. Different learning schemes are then used to control the inverter to inject elaborated reference currents in the power system. Results obtained by simulation and their real-time validation in experiments are presented to compare the compensation methods. By their learning capabilities, artificial neural networks are able to take into account time-varying parameters, and thus appreciably improve the performance of traditional compensating methods. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated in their application to harmonics compensation in power systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084691.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"76","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.888758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.888758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Artificial Neural Network Architecture for Active Power Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Artificial Neural Network Architecture for Active Power Filters","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9299032","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Artificial Neural Network Architecture for Active Power Filters","sourcePdf":"54tie01-ould.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04922S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"161","articleId":"4084691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4084692,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Pajchrowski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Information Engineering, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084692/4084692-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tomasz Pajchrowski graduated from the Poznan University of Technology (PUT), Poznan, Poland, in 2000, and received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from PUT in 2005.","He is currently an Assistant with the Electrical Engineering Faculty of PUT.

Moreover, with a suitably designed external controller, the SCRC can also be used to damp low-frequency power oscillations in a power network. Conventionally, linear control techniques are used to design the SCRC external controller around a specific operating point, where the nonlinear system equations are linearized. However, at other operating points its performance degrades. Nonlinear adaptive neuro-controllers offer an attractive approach to overcome this degradation problem. In this paper, an indirect adaptive external neuro-controller (INDAEC) using two radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) is proposed to improve the damping performance of an SCRC connected to a power network. This nonlinear INDAEC needs no mathematical model of the SCRC or the power network. It provides the SCRC with improved damping performance over a wide range of system operating conditions. This is shown by results on a single machine infinite bus power system, as well as a multimachine power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation converters","Damping","Voltage control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Degradation","Power system modeling","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear equations","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","neurocontrollers","power engineering computing","PWM power convertors","radial basis function networks","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indirect adaptive external neuro-control","INDAEC","series capacitive reactance compensator","SCRC","voltage source PWM converter","power oscillation damping","radial basis function neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indirect adaptive neuro-controller","radial basis function","series capacitive reactance compensator (SCRC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.888759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084695.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.888759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indirect Adaptive External Neuro-Control for a Series Capacitive Reactance Compensator Based on a Voltage Source PWM Converter in Damping Power Oscillations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Indirect Adaptive External Neuro-Control for a Series Capacitive Reactance Compensator Based on a Voltage Source PWM Converter in Damping Power Oscillations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084695/","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084695/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9299033","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect Adaptive External Neuro-Control for a Series Capacitive Reactance Compensator Based on a Voltage Source PWM Converter in Damping Power Oscillations","sourcePdf":"54tie01-qiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057097S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084698,"authors":[{"name":"Jos Rodriguez","affiliation":["Departmento de Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084698/4084698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (M'81\u2013SM'94) received the Engineer and Dr.\u2013Ing. degrees from the University Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valpara\u00edso, Chile, and the University of Erlangen, Germany, in 1977 and 1985, respectively, both in electrical engineering.","Since 1977, he has been with the University Federico Santa Mar\u00eda.

The exact form of the control law is unknown, and must be estimated by the NNC. Consequently, the NNC is constructed as a nonlinear unknown function depending on the current state of the drive system supplies by the NNI and the reference trajectory we wish the outputs to follow. The two NNs are online trained using dynamic back-propagation algorithm. The composite structure is used as a speed controller for the SMDS.

The flexibility of selective compensation embedded in the control scheme makes APF versatile for compensation of reactive power, harmonic currents, and unbalance in source currents and their combinations, depending upon the limited rating of voltage source inverter employed as APF. The proposed scheme utilizes neural network-based decomposition of the load current into positive and negative sequence fundamental frequency component, reactive component and harmonic components. The adaline-based current decomposer estimates the reference currents through tracking of unit vectors together with tuning of the weights.

Model-based methods are efficient monitoring systems for providing warning and predicting certain faults at early stages. However, the conventional methods must work with explicit motor models, and cannot be applied effectively for vibration signal diagnosis due to their nonadaptation and the random nature of vibration signal. In this paper, an analytical redundancy method using neural network modeling of the induction motor in vibration spectra is proposed for machine fault detection and diagnosis. The short-time Fourier transform is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals to continuous spectra for the neural network model training. The faults are detected from changes in the expectation of vibration spectra modeling error.

Generally speaking, the utilization of a coupled inductor is useful for raising the step-up ratio of the conventional boost converter. However, the switch surge voltage may be caused by the leakage inductor so that it will result in the requirement of high-voltage-rated devices. In the proposed topology, a three-winding coupled inductor is used for providing a high voltage gain without extreme switch duty-cycle and enhancing the utility rate of magnetic core. Moreover, the energy in the leakage inductor is released directly to the output terminal for avoiding the phenomenon of circulating current and the production of switch surge voltage. In addition, the delay time formed with the cross of primary and secondary currents of the coupled inductor is manipulated to alleviate the reverse-recovery current of the output diode. It can achieve the aim of high-efficiency power conversion. Furthermore, the closed-loop control methodology is utilized in the proposed scheme to overcome the voltage drift problem of the power source under the variation of loads.

Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed filter. Both of their results indicate that about 80% of the rms value of the common-mode voltage are suppressed, while the demand of differential-mode voltage filtering is still met. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive filters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage","Leakage current","Shafts","Cables","Filtering","Pulse width modulation","Insulation","Electrostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","passive filters","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel inverter-output passive filter","motor terminals","PWM drive system","differential-mode voltage filtering","common-mode voltage filtering","conventional RLC filter","common-mode transformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode voltage","differential-mode voltage","inverter","passive filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.885517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084727.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.885517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Inverter-Output Passive Filter for Reducing Both Differential- and Common-Mode - at the Motor Terminals in PWM Drive Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Inverter-Output Passive Filter for Reducing Both Differential- and Common-Mode <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$dv/dt$</tex></formula> at the Motor Terminals in PWM Drive Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084727/","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9299065","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Inverter-Output Passive Filter for Reducing Both Differential- and Common-Mode <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$dv/dt$</tex></formula> at the Motor Terminals in PWM Drive Systems","sourcePdf":"54tie01-xchen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052498S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"95","articleId":"4084727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":4084728,"authors":[{"name":"Hualiang Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4084635/4084728/4084728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hualiang Zhuang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In this model, the information is coded in terms of firing times of pulses that are generated by the neuron. The pulses transmit through the network and excite the dynamics of the neuron.

A new network-learning algorithm is also developed for this pulsed RBF network. The RBF neurons are generated based on the feature of the training data, and the synaptic delays can be adjusted to distribute these RBF neurons in the training data space. The pulse neural network has been implemented compactly with multiplierless approach for both the forward computation and learning algorithm with a field programmable gate array board.

By using a high capacity of an FPGA chip, the additional hardware such as an encoder counter and a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) generator is implemented in a single FPGA chip. As a result, the controller becomes cost effective. It was tested for controlling nonlinear systems such as a robot finger and an inverted pendulum on a moving cart to show performance of the controller","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2006.888791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4084635/04084734.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2006.888791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084635","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of a Real-Time Neural Network Controller With a DSP and an FPGA for Nonlinear Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084734/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of a Real-Time Neural Network Controller With a DSP and an FPGA for Nonlinear Systems","volume":"54","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084734/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9299050","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of a Real-Time Neural Network Controller With a DSP and an FPGA for Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"54tie01-jung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051426S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4084635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"4084635","articleId":"4084734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4084754,"authors":[{"name":"Michalis D.

The data-path acts as a coprocessor that accelerates computational intensive kernel regions thereby increasing the overall performance.

The automated coprocessor synthesis method and its integration to a design flow for executing applications on the system is presented. Analytical exploration in respect to the type of the custom data-path and to the microprocessor architecture is performed. The overall application speedups of eight real-life applications, relative to the software execution on the microprocessor, are estimated using the design flow. These speedups range from 1.75 to 3.95, having an average value of 2.72, while the overhead in circuit area is small.

These applications, complex both in terms of execution flow and amount of elaborated data, can be well addressed by multiprocessor systems on-chip (MPSoCs). MPSoCs are composed of simple processors and memories tightly interconnected with fast communication channels and customized IP cores for the most demanding functions can be implemented and attached to these systems to enhance performance even more. Reconfigurable devices like FPGA, can act as a target, even programmed at runtime, for the custom IP cores, or as a prototyping platform for the whole system. Image compression like JPEG2000, can benefit very much from this approach and this type of architectures. This paper shows how the most demanding task of the JPEG2000 compression algorithm, the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform, can be hardware accelerated and implemented in a multiprocessor system-on-chip prototyping platform on field programmable gate array (FPGA), CerberO.

The high front-to-back (F/B) ratio (up to 15 dB) is attributed to the constructive interference that takes place between the individual printed Yagi arrays in the design. Through the spacing of the elements, the directivity (between 9-11.5 dBi) and the F/B ratio can be altered to suit the application of interest. The operational principles of this design are discussed to give insight on the radiation mechanism of the antenna. An initial design at around 32.5 GHz is presented to show the performance capabilities of this configuration. An impedance bandwidth of 8.3% can be achieved around this frequency. Then, a parametric analysis is conducted to estimate the significance of the design parameters that affect the antenna's performance. Finally, measured return loss and radiation pattern performance at 5.2 GHz is displayed to validate the principles and simulated results of the design. The measured impedance bandwidth of 10% is achieved. The F/B ratio is 15 dB which is larger than values previously published by 5-10 dB. Additionally, a gain of 10.7 dBi is observed.

This technique utilizes an odd mode signal to generate fringing fields on either side of a microstrip gap under the antenna. This allows electromagnetic energy to be efficiently coupled from the transmission lines to the radiating antenna. In a balanced integrated antenna amplifier configuration, the proposed non-contact feeding method removes the need for any balun or power combining network. Hence in theory, a compact RF front-end design with lower losses can be realized. This feeding method has been successfully applied to the design of simple passive microstrip patch antennas and active integrated antennas (AIA). Simulated and measured results are also included to validate the proposed feeding concept and antenna designs. The performance of the proposed differential feeding technique on a simple microstrip patch antenna has been systematically studied. The study suggests that the proposed proximity method is broadband in nature, allowing antennas operating at different resonant frequencies to be swapped without the need to change the feed dimensions and without degrading the matching performance","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2006.889828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4084729/04084790.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"276","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2006.889828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Integrated Antenna Design Using a Contact-Less, Proximity Coupled, Differentially Fed Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Active Integrated Antenna Design Using a Contact-Less, Proximity Coupled, Differentially Fed Technique","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4084790/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9301377","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Integrated Antenna Design Using a Contact-Less, Proximity Coupled, Differentially Fed Technique","sourcePdf":"55tap02-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06109S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4084729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4084729","articleId":"4084790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4084791,"authors":[{"name":"Dehong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4084729/4084791/4084791-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dehong Liu was born in Hubei, China, in 1975.

MRAN is a sequential learning algorithm in which the number of hidden neurons are added or removed based on the input data and produces a compact network. The training for MRAN is done under no failure and no noise case and the trained network is then used when there is a failure. Thus, the need for knowing the element and the time of its failure, as required in other methods is eliminated.

The simulation and measurement show that the miniaturized antenna achieves a broad operating bandwidth of 2.9-11.6 GHz for a 10-dB return loss. In particular, the ground-plane effect on impedance performance is greatly reduced by cutting the notch from the radiator because the electric currents on the ground plane are significantly suppressed at the lower edge operating frequencies.

The proposed optimum load line biasing technique eliminates the requirement of conventional temperature-compensation circuits with temperature sensors to achieve temperature-invariant RF performance of diode-based RF circuits such as a linearizer, attenuator, phase shifter, etc. for various RF applications where it experiences wide temperature variations. The circuit responds directly to the junction temperature of the diode; thus, there will be no compensation error due to temperature gradient and self-heating of the diodes. This technique is very simple, accurate, and suitable to implement in monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit technology. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.889155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4084810/04084814.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"221","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.889155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Bias Load-Line Compensates Temperature Variation of Junction Diode's RF Resistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Bias Load-Line Compensates Temperature Variation of Junction Diode's RF Resistance","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292139","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Bias Load-Line Compensates Temperature Variation of Junction Diode's RF Resistance","sourcePdf":"55tmtt02-bera-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054599S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","isNumber":"4084810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4084814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4084829,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Helaoui","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4084810/4084829/4084829-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Helaoui (S'06) received the B.Eng. and M.Sc.A. degrees in communications from the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia, in 2002 and 2003, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at The University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","In 2002, he was a student member of the MEDIATRON Laboratory, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis.

This transformation has the potential to compensate deviations observed by comparing model predictions with LS measurements and to find an optimum state linear LS model without any change of the SS behavior. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.889154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.889154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084810","startPage":"195","endPage":"206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4084810/04084847.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084847","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","MODFETs","Voltage","Dispersion","Predictive models","Frequency dependence","Circuit simulation","Gallium nitride","Frequency domain analysis","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","semiconductor device models","state-space methods","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-space approach","large-signal transistor modeling","high-speed transistors","HEMT","high electron mobility transistors","multibias SS S-parameter measurements","linear LS model","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaN HEMT","large-signal (LS) transistor modeling","low-frequency (LF) dispersion","state\u2013space approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Systematic State\u2013Space Approach to Large-Signal Transistor Modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292137","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4084847/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084847/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic State\u2013Space Approach to Large-Signal Transistor Modeling","sourcePdf":"55tmtt02-seelmanneggebert-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083042S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4084810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4084810","articleId":"4084847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4084852,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tombak","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development, RF Micro Devices, Inc., Greensboro, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4084818/4084852/4084852-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Tombak (S'99\u2013M'04) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, in 2004.","From 1998 to 1999, he was with ASELSAN Military Electronics Inc., Ankara, Turkey.

For design purposes, the differential- and common-mode equivalent half-circuits are established. Based on these circuits, a better balanced filter structure is implemented so that the desired differential-mode response may be realized and the level of common-mode noise may be minimized simultaneously. Besides, a suitable capacitive or inductive cross-coupled effect is introduced so as to create two transmission zeros for improving the filter selectivity; however, it also enhances the signal imbalance and degrades the common-mode rejection. In this study, various second- and fourth-order balanced filters are implemented to discuss the associated differential-mode responses and the signal-imbalance phenomena resulted from the cross-coupled effect. Specifically, the fourth-order filter with a common-mode rejection ratio of 40 dB within the passband is demonstrated and examined","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4084810/04084857.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.889147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.889147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Balanced Coupled-Line Bandpass Filters With Common-Mode Noise Suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Band pass filters","Circuit noise","Working environment noise","Resonator filters","1f noise","Impedance matching","Microwave filters","Coupling circuits","Dipole antennas","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","equivalent circuits","interference suppression","microwave filters","poles and zeros","UHF filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["balanced coupled-line filter","bandpass filters","common-mode noise suppression","quarter-wavelength resonators","equivalent half-circuits","differential-mode response","capacitive cross-coupled effect","inductive cross-coupled effect","transmission zeros","improved filter selectivity","common-mode rejection","second-order balanced filter","fourth-order balanced filters","signal-imbalance phenomena"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balanced filter","common-mode noise suppression","coupled-line bandpass filter","quarter-wavelength resonator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel Balanced Coupled-Line Bandpass Filters With Common-Mode Noise Suppression","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4084857/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292147","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Balanced Coupled-Line Bandpass Filters With Common-Mode Noise Suppression","sourcePdf":"55tmtt02-wu-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063026S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4084810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4084810","articleId":"4084857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4084865,"authors":[{"name":"N.

While efficiency is an important performance issue in the mobile networks with multimedia services, the concept of fairness among services should also be considered. Game theory can provide an appropriate framework for formulating such fair and efficient CAC problem. In this paper, a selection method for fair-efficient threshold parameters of the CAC scheme in CDMA mobile multimedia systems with traffic asymmetry based on the framework of game theory is proposed. The proposed scheme provides fairness and efficiency in terms of uplink and downlink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for the 2 classes of traffic, and also guarantees the priority of class 0 calls over class 1 calls. Class 0 calls and class 1 calls are viewed as two players of a game. For the cooperative game, the arbitration schemes for the interpersonal comparisons of utility and the bargaining problem are investigated. In the aspect of the social welfare (total utility), the numerical results indicate that the Nash solution of the bargaining problem outperforms the equilibrium point of the noncooperative game and the solution of the interpersonal comparisons of utility due to its much higher total utility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Call Admission Control in CDMA Mobile Multimedia Systems with Traffic Asymmetry between Uplink and Downlink","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300888","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084883.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Call Admission Control in CDMA Mobile Multimedia Systems with Traffic Asymmetry between Uplink and Downlink","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084883/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10187627","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Call Admission Control in CDMA Mobile Multimedia Systems with Traffic Asymmetry between Uplink and Downlink","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047919S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4084883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4084889,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This is known as intersymbol interference (ISI) and is a function of the combined impulse response of the wireless channel and the transmit and receive digital/analog filters. This paper illustrates the effect of the digital and analog filters on ISI in a typical 802.11a/g WLAN OFDM modem. It is shown that the filters, rather than the actual wireless channel, dominate the impulse response. Two techniques, increasing the digital interpolation ratio and the use of frequency domain interpolation, are then introduced with the effect of reducing the impulse response and ISI. The result of implementing these two techniques at the transmitter is to reduce the required cyclic prefix by 50% for an ISI requirement of 40 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing for Low ISI in an OFDM Modem","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300924","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084907.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Designing for Low ISI in an OFDM Modem","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084907/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10187639","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing for Low ISI in an OFDM Modem","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044254S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4084907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4084927,"authors":[{"name":"Tirath Ramdas","affiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Tirath","lastName":"Ramdas","id":"37428674300"},{"name":"Greg Egan","affiliation":["Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Egan","id":"37285101500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4084927","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of FPGAs for Acceleration of High Performance Computing and their Application to Computational Molecular Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300963","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High performance computing","Biology computing","Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Computer applications","Computational biology","Sequences","Application software","DNA computing","Proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","DNA","field programmable gate arrays","molecular biophysics","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","high performance computing","computational molecular biology","molecular biocomputation workflows","DNA sequences","protein sequences","custom computing machines","software implementation","sequence alignment algorithms","programming problems","integration problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084927","abstract":"Molecular biocomputation workflows traditionally involve days of compute time to align DNA/protein sequences.

Similarly, CCMs may be used to accelerate workflows or operations in a wide range of domains, often dramatically outperforming large scale clusters.

The proposed algorithm incorporates PRPSO with a new relative velocity updating (RVU) approach to tradeoff the solution of each slave processing unit. The parallel algorithm based on the synchronous parallel implementation is developed to consider the neighborhoods decomposition of multiple particle swarm optimizers. The proposed PRPSO divides the neighborhood into sub-neighborhood so that computational effort is reduced and UC solutions are remarkably improved. The proposed method is performed on a test system up to 100 generating units with a scheduling time horizon of 24 hours. The numerical results show an economical saving in the total operating cost when compared to the previous literature results. Moreover, the proposed PRPSO based RVU scheme can considerably speed up the computation time of a traditional PSO, which is favorable for a large-scale UC problem implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300991","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084937.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Velocity Updating in Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Based Lagrangian Relaxation for Large-scale Unit Commitment Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Lagrangian functions","Large-scale systems","Power engineering and energy","Cost function","Power generation","Power generation economics","Power engineering","Velocity control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","parallel algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel relative particle swarm optimization","Lagrangian relaxation","constrained unit commitment","electric power system","relative velocity updating","slave processing unit","parallel algorithm","economical saving","combinatorial optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit commitment","Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization","Combinatorial Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Relative Velocity Updating in Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Based Lagrangian Relaxation for Large-scale Unit Commitment Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206165","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Velocity Updating in Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization Based Lagrangian Relaxation for Large-scale Unit Commitment Problem","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069103S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4084937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4084938,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Kang","affiliation":["Control Department, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Kang","id":"37408468600"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Control Department, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406771000"},{"name":"Qidi Wu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qidi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276588100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4084938","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel multi-optimum programming mode for the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

The need for speeding up this treatment comes from the rapid growth rate of biological sequence databases. In this paper we present a new approach to high performance biological sequence database scanning on graphics processing units. Using modern graphics processing units for high performance computing is facilitated by then- enhanced programmability and motivated by their attractive price/performance ratio and incredible growth in speed. To derive an efficient mapping onto this type of architecture, we have reformulated the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm in terms of computer graphics primitives. This results in an implementation with significant runtime savings on two standard off-the-shelf computer graphics cards. To our knowledge this is the first reported mapping of biological sequence alignment onto a graphics processing unit.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300995","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084941.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Graphics Hardware to Accelerate Biological Sequence Database Scanning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Graphics Hardware to Accelerate Biological Sequence Database Scanning","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084941/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206168","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4084941/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Graphics Hardware to Accelerate Biological Sequence Database Scanning","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061152S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4084941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4084958,"authors":[{"name":"Panom Petchjatuporn","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Panom","lastName":"Petchjatuporn","id":"37422695400"},{"name":"Wannaya Ngamkham","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wannaya","lastName":"Ngamkham","id":"37299292100"},{"name":"Noppadol Khaehintung","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Noppadol","lastName":"Khaehintung","id":"37282124300"},{"name":"Phaophak Sirisuk","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Phaophak","lastName":"Sirisuk","id":"37283910900"},{"name":"Wiwat Kiranon","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wiwat","lastName":"Kiranon","id":"37299294300"},{"name":"Anatawat Kunakorn","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakom University of Technology, Ladkrabang, Thailand"],"firstName":"Anatawat","lastName":"Kunakorn","id":"37427571100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4084958","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":938},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084958","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Switches","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Power engineering and energy","Solar energy","Photovoltaic cells","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","microcontrollers","neural nets","photovoltaic power systems","power engineering computing","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solar-powered battery charger","neural network maximum power point tracking","low-cost PIC-microcontroller","artificial neural network","low-cost PIC16F876 microcontroller","commercial solar array","MPPT","photovoltaic systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301032","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084958.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Solar-powered Battery Charger with Neural Network Maximum Power Point Tracking Implemented on a Low-Cost PIC-microcontroller","abstract":"This paper presents the development of a maximum power point tracking algorithm using an artificial neural network for a solar power system.

The reconfigurable coder/decoder (codec) which was constructed with arrayed-waveguide-grating (AWG), optical switch and additional controller unit is used as the basic system to realize the implementation of dynamic code matrix assignment. Instead of employing a huge code space, we adopt the spectral amplitude coding (SAC) with unipolar M-sequence code matrix for a specific signature address (coding) and its match address codeword (decoding). Furthermore, a weighted load balance problem based on the power distribution on each wavelength is investigated, and then a dynamic reconfiguration policy is proposed to choose the best code matrix assignment with the minimum weighted degree of load balance. The evaluation results show that the dynamic reconfiguration policy can outperform a class of static policies in terms of two performance metrics, weighted degree of load balancing and the number of register shifting.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301071","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04084978.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Design of Reconfigurable Encoder and Decoder Against Un-authorized Users in Optical CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4084978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4084978/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Design of Reconfigurable Encoder and Decoder Against Un-authorized Users in Optical CDMA Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206204","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4084978/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Design of Reconfigurable Encoder and Decoder Against Un-authorized Users in Optical CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069857S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4084978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4084997,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As a result, space-time coding and transmit beamforming have emerged as the two most promising techniques. Because of limited space at the mobile station (MS) and the fact that download intensive services are to be introduced in the next generation of cellular systems, most of research efforts have been pouring on transmit diversity techniques. In this paper, we focus on adaptive uplink transmission and reception techniques for wireless communications and introduce a new frequency-time encoding scheme that can be used to exploit frequency diversity branches for broadband OFDM systems with only one antenna at the MS. By incorporating this with receive beamforming at the base station (BS), the instantaneous signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) is maximized and the system error-rate performance is then further improved. Numerical results showed that systems employed the proposed transceiver structure have a 4-dB improvement over the conventional space-time coding scheme when two receive antennas are used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Receiver Beamforming for Diversity Coded OFDM Systems: Maximum SNR Design","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301115","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Receiver Beamforming for Diversity Coded OFDM Systems: Maximum SNR Design","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085003/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206227","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Receiver Beamforming for Diversity Coded OFDM Systems: Maximum SNR Design","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056292S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4085008,"authors":[{"name":"Yuu-seng Lau","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuu-seng","lastName":"Lau","id":"37418843100"},{"name":"Kevin H.

Spreading sequences that are used to scramble data in spread spectrum (SS) systems can be generated using a single mathematical relationship of a chaotic generator. These chaotic sequences are very difficult to predict over long-term chaotic pattern unless the exact initial condition of the chaotic generator is known, providing security. On the other hand, beamforming and orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) transmit diversity techniques are known to provide optimal transmitting structures for communication systems, especially if combined. Based on the signal angle-of- arrival (AoA) estimates, the channel correlation matrix can be constructed, and it is shown that signal transmission of OSTBC codes in the eigen-modes of this matrix gives an effective array weighting gain which improves system error performance without sacrificing any diversity and coding gain. A performance study of CSK with beamforming and space-time encoded is carried out in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","accessionNumber":"10206232","htmlLink":"/document/4085008/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Encoded Secure Chaos Communications with Transmit Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Encoded Secure Chaos Communications with Transmit Beamforming","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067985S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4085011,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089064678"},{"name":"Tat M.

To compensate for the detection error at the relay node, we propose a relay selection protocol, which can lower the error floor and nearly achieve full diversity order.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301123","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085011.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiple-Relay Decode-and-Forward Cooperation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multiple-Relay Decode-and-Forward Cooperation System","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085011/","accessionNumber":"10206235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085011/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multiple-Relay Decode-and-Forward Cooperation System","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038755S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4085014,"authors":[{"name":"Hideto Sakakibara","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideto","lastName":"Sakakibara","id":"38117858200"},{"name":"Eiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37074851100"},{"name":"Yasunori Iwanami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunori","lastName":"Iwanami","id":"37297405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085014","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"Wavelet packet modulation (WPM) was proposed as one of the multicarrier transmission methods like OFDM. Since it is a multicarrier transmission method, however, it has a high peak to averaged power ratio (PAPR). For improving PAPR of OFDM, the Single Carrier OFDM (SC-OFDM) method was proposed and it is expected that the principle of SC-OFDM can be used in WPM. In this paper, we consider applying the WPM to satellite communications. The BER performance of WPM and OFDM in a fading channel is compared, and it is shown that the performance of WPM is better than OFDM. Then, we propose the single carrier WPM (SC-WPM) method that applies the principle of SC-OFDM to WPM to remedy the PAPR, and show that the performance is improved substantially.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wavelet Packet Modulation Method for Satellite Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","Satellite communication","Peak to average power ratio","Discrete wavelet transforms","OFDM modulation","Fading","Wavelet analysis","Time frequency analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet packet modulation method","satellite communications","multicarrier transmission methods","peak to averaged power ratio","BER","fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet Packet Modulation","OFDM","SC-WPM","SC-OFDM","satellite communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Wavelet Packet Modulation Method for Satellite Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085014/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206238","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wavelet Packet Modulation Method for Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036334S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4085035,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We used a 2D self-organizing feature map as a feature extractor which acts as a sequential mapping function in order to transform the acoustic vector sequences of speech signal into trajectories. The output of SOM is a matrix with same dimension and its elements take on binary values. The transformation of the feature vector simplifies the classification task by recognizer using multilayer perceptron. The MLP classifies the binary trajectories that each syllable corresponds to. Experiments were conducted on the 15 Malay syllables by 10 speakers for conventional technique (MLP only) and proposed technique (SOM and MLP).

The high speed FPGA performance enables us to build up a three dimension time-frequency spectrogram for audio signal by accumulating the spectral data against the evolution time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach to FPGA-based Time-Frequency Spectrogram by Real-Time Sweep Spectral Extraction Algorithm","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301298","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An Approach to FPGA-based Time-Frequency Spectrogram by Real-Time Sweep Spectral Extraction Algorithm","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085098/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206311","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to FPGA-based Time-Frequency Spectrogram by Real-Time Sweep Spectral Extraction Algorithm","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067335S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085107,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongyang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhongyang Xiong is a professor of the Department of Computer Science at Chongqing University, China and now is a visiting scholar of the Computer Science Department at University of Kentucky, USA.

The high peaks in STC-OFDM signals are clipped to limit the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In STC-OFDM and OFDM, clipping can achieve significant PAPR reduction while maintaining a low symbol error rate (SER). Previous studies on OFDM have concluded that the effect of channel fading on clipping noise must be considered for an accurate error performance analysis. We extend this further to incorporate STC-OFDM systems and jointly study the impact of channel fading and receiver combining on clipping noise. At the STC-OFDM receiver, effective clipping noise governing the signal-to-noise ratio has different characteristics compared to the same for OFDM. Simulations indicate that STC-OFDM is more sensitive to clipping effects than OFDM. The theoretical and simulated SER are also compared for clipped STC-OFDM.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085143.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Performance Analysis of Clipped Alamouti Space-Time Coded OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Nonlinear distortion","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error performance analysis","clipped Alamouti space-time coded OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","STC-OFDM signals","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR reduction","symbol error rate","channel fading","receiver combining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Error Performance Analysis of Clipped Alamouti Space-Time Coded OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206354","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Performance Analysis of Clipped Alamouti Space-Time Coded OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107153S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4085144,"authors":[{"name":"Tasso Athanasiadis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Tasso","lastName":"Athanasiadis","id":"37297373500"},{"name":"Kevin H.

In this paper, we introduce a transmission system for multimedia communication employing STBC-OFDM with adaptive beamforming incorporating a perceptually-based image compression coder - which consists of a 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT), an adaptive quantizer (with thresholding) and variable-length entropy encoding.

When the channel is not constant during the period of Alamouti codeword transmission, the conventional linear maximum likelihood (ML) receiver suffers from performance degradation. We use three different receiver combining methods and study the error performance. The sensitivity of different receivers is investigated by varying the correlation coefficient. Our results can be easily extended to be applicable to other block coded OFDM schemes with different antenna configurations. The performance loss in linear ML receiver can be partially improved by employing a decision-feedback strategy. In the decision feedback steps preliminary decisions are used to subtract the intercodeword coupling. However this increases the computational complexity of the receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085146.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alamouti Coded OFDM in Rayleigh Fast Fading Channels - Receiver Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Performance analysis","Diversity reception","Degradation","Performance loss","Maximum likelihood detection","Feedback","Transmitting antennas","Time varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","maximum likelihood decoding","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Alamouti code","OFDM","Rayleigh fast fading channel","receiver performance analysis","block code","antenna configuration","linear maximum likelihood receiver","decision feedback","intercodeword coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Alamouti Coded OFDM in Rayleigh Fast Fading Channels - Receiver Performance Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206357","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alamouti Coded OFDM in Rayleigh Fast Fading Channels - Receiver Performance Analysis","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066492S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4085149,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Industrial Design, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37288699700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085149","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Covariance matrix","Bandwidth","Wireless LAN","Digital video broadcasting","Channel estimation","Matrix converters","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","carrier frequency offset estimation","zero-prefix OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","blind algorithm","greatest common divisor structure","channel parameters","error-free message recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel","Estimation","Frequency Offset","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a blind algorithm is proposed for channel and CFO estimation in zero-prefix OFDM systems.

We propose a new interpolation method derived from singular value decomposition (SVD). This method can effectively mitigate the influences from the limitations mentioned above. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the cubic spline one under non-equidistant pilot pattern, in which DFT-based method could not work.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300841","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Interpolation Method for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Interpolation Method for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085161/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206371","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4085161/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Interpolation Method for Channel Estimation of OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052261S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085163,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the majority of past work, these two aspects have typically been treated separately. Recently (Derpich et al., 2005) we have introduced a novel algorithm called MSIC which uses moving horizon optimization ideas to determine both when and how to sample. Our earlier work (Derpich et al., 2005) gave a heuristic description of the algorithm and showed, via simulations, that a performance gain was achieved in both the required bit rate and the achieved distortion level. This seemingly paradoxical result is due to the interpolative capabilities inherent in MSIC. The goal of the current paper is to give theoretical support to the MSIC algorithm. In particular, we provide bounds on the probability that beneficial interpolation occurs for the particular case of horizon length 2 with flat, unity gain error weighting filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4085177/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206385","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Probability of Interpolation for a Mute Sample Interpolative A/D Converter with Horizon-Length Two","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability of Interpolation for a Mute Sample Interpolative A/D Converter with Horizon-Length Two","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047434S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085179,"authors":[{"name":"Yuu-seng Lau","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuu-seng","lastName":"Lau","id":"37418843100"},{"name":"Jusak Jusak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Jusak","lastName":"Jusak","id":"37427559000"},{"name":"Zahir M.

Recent studies showed that this sequence can enhance the security and increase the capacity of the system at the physical link due to its bifurcation behavior. In this paper, we investigate the performance of multiuser detection schemes in chaos based and PN code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems. Two well- known schemes are applied and compared: adaptive filtering using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and matched filtering (using a correlator). Simulation results showed that, for both schemes, the chaos-based CDMA outperforms the PN-based CDMA in terms of bit error rate (BER) and mean-squared error (MSE).","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300876","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085179.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Adaptive Multiuser Detection for Chaos CDMA Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Adaptive Multiuser Detection for Chaos CDMA Communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085179/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206387","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4085179/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Adaptive Multiuser Detection for Chaos CDMA Communication","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072384S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":4085206,"authors":[{"name":"Micheal Drieberg","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Department, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Micheal","lastName":"Drieberg","id":"37392080700"},{"name":"Yew Kuan Min","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Department, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yew Kuan","lastName":"Min","id":"37288346200"},{"name":"Varun Jeoti","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Department, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Jeoti","id":"37298071500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085206","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Performance analysis","OFDM","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Metropolitan area networks","Bit error rate","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel estimation","IEEE802.16a","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multi-input multi-output","wireless communications systems","MIMO-OFDM system","wireless metropolitan area network","time domain channel impulse response","symbol period","channel state information","fixed broadband wireless access","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM","IEEE802.16a","ST Codes","fixed Broadband Wireless Access"]}],"abstract":"Both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) are key enabling technologies for future wireless communications systems. For both these technologies to work optimally, the channel between each pair of transmitter and receiver needs to be estimated accurately. In an earlier work, we had proposed a simple channel estimation method for a MIMO-OFDM system based on IEEE802.16a (wireless metropolitan area network (MAN)). The channel estimates were obtained by cyclically rotating the preamble in such a way that the time domain channel impulse response (CIR) from each transmitter can be separated in time within one symbol period.

Two mapping methods are employed: conventional repetition mapping and the proposed mapping methods with the design criteria of achieving full diversity including spatial and frequency at the maximum possible transmission rate. The proposed mapping method appears to outperform the conventional mapping counterpart with respect to coding gain when constructing the SF codes mapped from SOSTT codes. Simulation results show the performance gain of 0.5-3 dB under frequency-selective fading channels. In addition, the constructed SF codes mapped with both mapping methods are compared to the existing commonly known SF codes, i.e. the space-time trellis (STT) codes mapped with conventional mapping method. Apparently the SOSTT codes are superior to the STT codes in single-carrier narrowband wireless channel, the mapped SOSTT codes do not offer the same advantage over the mapped STT codes under the severely-frequency-selective fading channel when the codes having large number of states. Nevertheless, some performance improvement is observed for codes with small number of states.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.300983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.300983","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085228.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Space-Frequency Codes from Super-Orthogonal Space-Time Trellis Codes via Mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Space-Frequency Codes from Super-Orthogonal Space-Time Trellis Codes via Mapping","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085228/","accessionNumber":"10206433","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085228/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Space-Frequency Codes from Super-Orthogonal Space-Time Trellis Codes via Mapping","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04311S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085235,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromichi Hashizume","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Hashizume","id":"37283155600"},{"name":"Ayumu Kaneko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ayumu","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"38130904600"},{"name":"Yusuke Sugano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Sugano","id":"38136389300"},{"name":"Koji Yatani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Yatani","id":"37283156700"},{"name":"Masanori Sugimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Sugimoto","id":"37265657200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085235","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":371},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085235","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic variables measurement","Ultrasonic imaging","Position measurement","Time measurement","Ubiquitous computing","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Distance measurement","RF signals","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","ubiquitous computing","ultrasonic applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic phase accordance method","innovative measurement","positioning systems","ultrasonic signals","one-time ultrasonic packet","ubiquitous computing","mobile devices","ultrasonic communication","special ultrasonic burst signal","sync pattern","communication packet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic measurement","signal processing","positioning system","time of arrival","angle of arrival"]}],"abstract":"An innovative measurement technique for use by positioning systems using ultrasonic signals was developed.

The technique, which is named phase accordance method, uses two or more carriers in ultrasonic communication.

The link level study begins with the downlink interference analysis and power allocations for each downlink dedicated channels. Downlink soft handover gain is used in the system level simulation as a main parameter to evaluate the effects of cell selection and power control mechanisms on the downlink soft handover performance. Simulation result has shown that by using 2-way soft handover mechanism, the required dedicated transmission power can be reduced up to 3 dB. Besides that, the cell selection scheme based on distance and Ec/10 value gives better SHO gain (1.3dB) to the system with SHO overhead equals to 30%. Simulation also has shown that the system can benefit from the soft handover process at 20% to 30% of the SHO overhead. However, power control mechanism does not give significant impact to the SHO gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085251.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Soft Handover Mechanism Performance in WCDMA System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Interference","Power control","Frequency estimation","Educational institutions","Performance gain","Quality of service","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","power control","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink soft handover mechanism","WCDMA system","downlink interference analysis","power allocations","downlink dedicated channels","power control mechanisms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["soft handover","downlink capacity","WCDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Soft Handover Mechanism Performance in WCDMA System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206454","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Soft Handover Mechanism Performance in WCDMA System","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05113S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085252,"authors":[{"name":"Rajinda Senaratne","affiliation":["Mechatronics Research Group, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajinda","lastName":"Senaratne","id":"37680736800"},{"name":"Saman Halgamuge","affiliation":["Mechatronics Research Group, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Halgamuge","id":"37270510900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085252","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085252","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Optimization methods","Mechatronics","Manufacturing","Image databases","Pattern recognition","Linear discriminant analysis","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","graph theory","image matching","image representation","particle swarm optimisation","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","elastic bunch graph matching","face recognition","face representation","face bunch graph","face graph similarity","deformable graph","face image","landmark location","optimal graph","principal component analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301026","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085252.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Particle Swarm Optimisation for Elastic Bunch Graph Matching to Recognise Faces","abstract":"A new approach to face recognition, where elastic bunch graph matching technique optimised with particle swarm optimisation is proposed in this paper. It is a fully automatic algorithm and can be used for databases where only one image per person is available. A face is represented by a face graph. A face bunch graph is created as a generalised representation of faces of various individuals. The face graph similarity between the face bunch graph and the deformable graph that has to be fitted to the face in the image is maximised by particle swarm optimisation, to locate the landmarks and thereby to find the optimal graph to represent a face. Improved results were obtained by this method as apposed to elastic bunch graph matching without optimisation. Results were further improved by hybridising it with principal component analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085252/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10206455","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085252/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Particle Swarm Optimisation for Elastic Bunch Graph Matching to Recognise Faces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Particle Swarm Optimisation for Elastic Bunch Graph Matching to Recognise Faces","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05703S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4085285,"authors":[{"name":"Maitrali Marik","affiliation":["IBM-Global Services, India"],"firstName":"Maitrali","lastName":"Marik","id":"37428469000"},{"name":"Ajit Pal","affiliation":["Department of CSE, IIT, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Ajit","lastName":"Pal","id":"37286349300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085285","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Binary decision diagrams","Data structures","Circuit synthesis","Boolean functions","Phased arrays","Programmable logic arrays","Delay","Silicon","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic circuits","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Actel-1 MUX-based field programmable gate arrays","logic synthesis","decomposed BDD representation","one-to-one correspondence","mapping","optimization","power dissipation","ISCAS benchmark circuits"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel logic synthesis and technology mapping approach for Actel-1 MUX-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for low power and high performance applications.

The classification hierarchy generates low-level concepts, and concept hierarchy generates high-level concepts from low-level concepts. Our classification hierarchy is based on a few popular audio and video content analysis techniques like short-time energy and zero crossing rate (ZCR) for audio and hidden Markov model (HMM) based techniques for video, using color and motion as features. From these low-level concepts of classification hierarchy, rule-based classifier generates higher-level concepts. The proposed framework has been successfully tested with TV news video sequences. Our results are very promising. We have used top-down hierarchical approach, which permits us to avoid shot detection and clustering and consequently improves the classification performance. This has created the great opportunity for supporting more powerful video search engines.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301204","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Indexing of News Video Sequences: A Multimodal Hierarchical Approach Based on Hidden Markov Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Indexing of News Video Sequences: A Multimodal Hierarchical Approach Based on Hidden Markov Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085334/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206529","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4085334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Indexing of News Video Sequences: A Multimodal Hierarchical Approach Based on Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065806S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4085342,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Recently, linear precoding has been proposed to achieve frequency diversity (multipath diversity) in OFDM, which overcomes the problem of channel nulls (deep fades in frequency-domain). However, currently reported precoding techniques for OFDM have high computational complexity due to associated maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding or pseudo-inverse of large matrices (linear decoding). In the proposed diversity enhanced-OFDM (DE-OFDM), the decoding complexity is minimal as maximum ratio combining (MRC) is incorporated at the receiver to generate a decision variable for each repeatedly transmitted symbol over multiple subcarriers. Moreover, we show that DE-OFDM does not cause any effective data rate (throughput) loss as DE-OFDM using a higher-order modulation scheme (thus the same data rate as conventional OFDM) can provide a better error performance. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of DE-OFDM in achieving frequency diversity benefit with low receiver complexity in multipath (frequency-selective) channels. DE-OFDM also outperforms the previously proposed ICI self-cancellation schemes in a frequency-selective fading channel with small frequency offset error.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2005.301212","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4084859/4084860/04085342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2005.301212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084860","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Diversity Enhanced OFDM for Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Diversity Enhanced OFDM for Wireless Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085342/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"10206537","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4085342/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Diversity Enhanced OFDM for Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"TENCON-00-482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053043S","chronDate":"21-24 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4084859","isNumber":"4084860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4084859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4084860","articleId":"4085342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085350,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Sik Choi","affiliation":[" Computer Engineering, University of Inc.heon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Sik","lastName":"Choi","id":"37676418300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9312-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9311-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"4085350","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"abstract":"In order to support high data-rate service in an integrated CDMA system, it is required to allocate resources for data users with high spectral efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the performance of two resource allocation schemes such as a simultaneous resource allocation(SRA) scheme and a throughput maximization(TM) scheme. In the throughput maximization scheme, the throughput of data users can be maximized when one among data users is allowed to transmit information at any given time. To apply this scheme to an voice/data CDMA system, resources are first allocated to voice users and then residual resources are allocated to data users based on the throughput maximization strategy. For more practical approach, the transmission power of mobile stations is assumed to be limited. Due to this assumption, the performance of two resource allocation schemes is varied according to the location of mobile stations. We also show the performance under perfect power control and imperfect power control. In order to verify the analysis results, we perform the simulation under the same environment. Simulation and analysis results show that the TM scheme has higher throughput than the SRA scheme under the conditions that the mobile is located in a limited boundary and the variation of E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n/N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n is minimized.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2005 -

computing paradigms to publish and access software components as services. Various enterprises now publish their business as Web services. Business processes of these enterprises involved in B2B and B2C transactions require composition of distributed heterogeneous services to accomplish a task. Business processes are complex, dynamic and event-driven. To capture the dynamic nature of business process we need to choreograph and orchestrated the business partners and the task involve in the process. With the development of standard like Web services resource framework and Web services notification, Web services now become stateful and now supporting event and notification. To model the Web services based event-driven composition and business process both event and state should be considered. In this paper we propose event calculus and BPEL based business process modeling and composition.

Space division multiplexing (SDM) is one of the most promising techniques for achieving more efficient bandwidth utilization, since it enable the transmission rate over MIMO channels to be increased by using multiple antennas on both the transmitter and receiver sides. Recently, since cost of RF is much higher than the antennas, there is growing interest in techniques that use larger number of antennas than the number of transmitter RF. These methods rely on selecting the optimal transmitter antennas and connecting them to respective RF. In this case, the FBI is required to select the optimal transmitter antennas. However, transmission of the FBI through a feedback channel is limited. Moreover, multiple antennas system requires an antenna separation of 5-10 wavelength to keep the correlation coefficient below 0.7 for achieving the diversity gain. In this case, base station is required a wide space to set the multiple antenna. To reduce these problems, in this paper, we propose and analyze the transmit sector antenna selection with considering the link correlation for SDM/OFDM without FBI","doi":"10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2006.301892","publicationTitle":"2006 Innovations in Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Innovations in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4085390/4043134/04085409.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2006.301892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Sector Selection with Considering the Link Correlation for SDM/OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085409/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Sector Selection with Considering the Link Correlation for SDM/OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9309198","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085409/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Sector Selection with Considering the Link Correlation for SDM/OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"INNOVATI-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044751S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085390","isNumber":"4043134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085390","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4043134","articleId":"4085409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085413,"authors":[{"name":"Fariba Shadabi","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences and Engineering, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Fariba","lastName":"Shadabi","id":"37661977400"},{"name":"Dharmendra Sharma","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences and Engineering, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Dharmendra","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37286509900"},{"name":"Robert Cox","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences and Engineering, University of Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Cox","id":"38116216400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0673-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0674-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4085413","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085413","abstract":"Predicting the outcome of a medical procedure or event with high level of accuracy can be a challenging task. To answer the challenge, data mining can play a significant role. The main objective of this study is to examine the performances of an artificially intelligent (Al)-based data mining technique namely artificial neural network ensemble (ANNE) in prediction of medical outcomes. It also describes a novel approach, namely \"RIDC-ANNE\". This approach tries to improve data quality by configuring an ensemble of bagged networks as a filter and identifying the regions in the data space that have high impact on the system performance. Furthermore, it can also be used to extract explanations and knowledge from several combined neural network classifiers. The methodology employed utilizes a series of clinical datasets. The datasets embody a number of important properties, which make them a good starting point for the purpose of this research.

MIMO communication systems have been a strong research topic for several years because of spectral efficiency advantages, and are starting to see adoption in real-time communication systems. The group research department in Tait Electronics has a reconfigurable platform for MIMO research. In particular, the platform has an adaptive multivariate DFE, utilizing LMS, currently implemented. The LMS algorithm has been simulated and optimized for implementation on the FPGA.

In particular, we develop a two-step hard-decision interference cancellation receiver for a multiuser-MIMO uplink system which employs orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and space-time block codes (STBC). The STBC has been implemented either over adjacent tones or adjacent OFDM symbols and the performances of both implementations have been tested under slowly time-varying channels. The two-step receiver structure has been implemented using a combined interference suppression scheme based on minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and symbol-wise likelihood detectors, which is then followed by an interference cancellation step. The receiver can suppress and cancel the interference from the co-channel users effectively without increasing the complexity significantly.

The proposed best M users' best L subbands feedback method can significantly reduce the feedback overhead. The proposed scheme utilizes the property of the proposed fair (PF) scheduler that most of the subbands are assigned to the users with high average SNR by time selectivity of channel and some high SNR subbands are assigned to the users by frequency selectivity. For adaptive implementation, the threshold assisted feedback method is proposed. In the numerical results, it is showed that the feedback overhead of the proposed scheme is about 12% of the full CSI feedback method with little throughput loss when the number of users is 50","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2006.301408","publicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4085644/4037317/04085703.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2006.301408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback Assisted Scheduling and Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085703/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback Assisted Scheduling and Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085703/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Feedback Assisted Scheduling and Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICCS-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084671S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085644","isNumber":"4037317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085644","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4037317","articleId":"4085703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4085704,"authors":[{"name":"Soumaya Hamouda","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de, Tunis- Tunis, Tunisia","Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de, Tunis- Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Soumaya","lastName":"Hamouda","id":"37644766400"},{"name":"Philippe Godlewski","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Telecommunications, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Godlewski","id":"37298520700"},{"name":"Sami Tabbane","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de, Tunis- Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Tabbane","id":"37282329300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0410-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0411-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4085704","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Partitioning algorithms","Radiofrequency interference","Frequency conversion","Resource management","Constraint optimization","Interference constraints","Interchannel interference","Bandwidth","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","power control","probability","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced capacity","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multicell OFDMA system","power control algorithm","subcarrier assignment","resource allocation optimization","cochannel interference","CCI","outage probability","adaptive frequency reuse factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","co-channel interference","subcarrier assignment","frequency reuse","multi-cell","power control"]}],"abstract":"The increasing demand for high data rate services has created an acute requirement for efficient subcarrier assignment and power control algorithms in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. Resource allocation optimization becomes even more constraining in multi-cell OFDMA systems because of the presence of co-channel interference (CCI). In this paper, we mitigate the CCI impact with a particular frequency reuse partitioning strategy. We propose a new centralized and low-complexity algorithm that minimizes the outage probability in the entire system. With this algorithm, adaptive frequency reuse factors are applied according to users' bandwidth requirements. We also apply a power control scheme that improves system capacity without increasing the CCI level.

While c\u03bc-rule is asymptotically optimum in continuous-time server allocation, it needs to be adjusted when applied to discrete-time server allocation in OFDMA systems. Bit-based allocation considers the allocation through bit-based connectivity. Resource wastage is prevented by greedy reassignment in low traffic regime. Packet-based allocation adopts c\u03bc-rule and allocates the servers through multiple-packet rates. The allocation is ordered from the server with lowest connectivity to the server with highest connectivity. Simulation results show that bit-based allocation outperforms packet-based allocation in queue length minimization for small number of users. With increasing number of users, the performance difference becomes smaller and at the certain limit, the packet-based allocation performs better. Furthermore, the packet-based allocation might be better in practical realization due to the lower complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Generalized C\u03bc-rule Scheduling for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2006.301410","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4085644/4037317/04085705.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2006.301410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2006-Nov. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Applying Generalized C\u03bc-rule Scheduling for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085705/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308875","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Generalized C\u03bc-rule Scheduling for Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICCS-00-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052659S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085644","isNumber":"4037317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085644","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4037317","articleId":"4085705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085706,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad S.

The data likelihood function is, in general, non linear or/and non Gaussian leading to analytically intractable inference. Particle filter is a popular approximate Monte Carlo solution based on a particle representation of the filtering distribution. However, power constraints in sensor networks require an additional approximation (compression) when communicating the particle based representation. In this contribution, we propose an alternative ensemble learning (variational) approximation suitable to the communication constraints of sensor networks. The efficiency of the variational approximation relies on the fact that the online update of the filtering distribution and its compression are simultaneously performed. In addition, the variational approach has the nice property to be parameterization-independent ensuring the robustness of the data processing. The selection of the leader node is based on a trade-off between communication constraints and information content relevance of measured data","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2006.301437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037317","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4085644/4037317/04085732.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble Learning Online Filtering in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlLink":"/document/4085732/","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble Learning Online Filtering in Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308853","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble Learning Online Filtering in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICCS-00-88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074637S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085644","isNumber":"4037317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085644","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4037317","articleId":"4085732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4085736,"authors":[{"name":"Boon Chin Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, TRLaboratories, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Boon Chin","lastName":"Lim","id":"37289729200"},{"name":"Witold A.

To implement TZFBF, channel state information is required at the transmitter (CSIT). When CSIT is available, it is known that additional constraints imposed on the transmitter will reduce the system sum rate. Despite this, transmit antenna selection (TAS) provides a means of increasing the sum rate in some cases when sub-optimal RAS algorithms are used. The mechanism works by assisting the RAS search path to get out of a local maximum. The proposed method requires further RAS to follow any prior TAS process and the restoration of any transmit antennas that were removed. An analysis is provided to give insight to the proposed method. The analysis and scheme are applicable to any sub-optimal RAS algorithm and guidelines on decoupled search strategies are given. The analysis also affirms the statement that given CSIT, TAS does not help improve the sum rate of TZFBF, regardless of the channel condition and signal-to-noise ratio when optimal RAS is already done. This means that joint exhaustive RAS-TAS searches are not needed to achieve the optimal sum rate and instead, only exhaustive RAS or user selection search is needed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085736/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9308826","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085736/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection for Sum Rate Maximization in Transmit Zero-Forcing Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection for Sum Rate Maximization in Transmit Zero-Forcing Beamforming","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICCS-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057519S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085644","isNumber":"4037317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085644","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4037317","articleId":"4085736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085740,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Yu","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37291676300"},{"name":"Sangarapillai Lambotharan","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, Cardiff University, UK"],"firstName":"Sangarapillai","lastName":"Lambotharan","id":"37273617900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0410-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0411-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4085740","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multipath channels","Frequency estimation","Signal resolution","Additive noise","Transmitters","Doppler shift","GSM","Equalizers","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","convergence of numerical methods","equalisers","frequency estimation","iterative methods","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative joint channel estimation","equalization technique","multipath channel","multiple frequency offset estimation","data detection algorithm","pilot symbol","signal transmission","convergence","Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB"]}],"abstract":"We provide an iterative joint channel estimation and data detection algorithm for multipath channels with multiple frequency offsets (FOs).

The expression of the ICI power with GCC is derived and the optimum coefficients of the GCC are obtained based on the minimization of the ICI power. The maximum reduction rate in the ICI power is obtained with respect to the GCC coefficients length from the lower bound of the minimum ICI power and it is shown that the ICI power decreases as the GCC coefficients length increases, leading to CIR improvement.

However, the presence of residual inter-chip-interference (ICI) after MMSE-FDE produces the orthogonality distortion among the spreading codes and the BER performance degrades as the number of multiplex order increases. Recently, we have proposed a frequency-domain ICI cancellation to improve the uncoded performance. To further improve the BER performance, in this paper, we propose MMSE turbo equalization.

The use of frequency-domain equalization (FDE) can significantly improve the BER performance. However, the local average received signal power slowly varies due to path loss and shadowing loss according to the movement of a mobile user. This variation degrades the link capacity particularly when the user is located close to the cell edge. To improve the link capacity, the well-known site diversity can be used in conjunction with FDE. In this paper, we present downlink site diversity with FDE for a DS-CDMA cellular system and derive the MMSE weight for site diversity combining. The downlink capacity is evaluated by computer simulation and compared to the case with coherent rake combining.

Improvement is due to the coding gain coupled with interleaving and depends on the complexity of the code. Recently, it was shown that constellation rotation coupled with interleaving can be used to improve the performance of QPSK modulation over block-fading single-input-single-output (SISO) wireless communication channels. This paper considers the use of such a scheme with higher order constellation sets such as 8PSK and 16QAM. A framework is then presented for the calculation of the optimum rotation angle for MPSK/MQAM schemes. A simple cost function based on the union bound of the symbol error probability (SEP) is defined. The optimum rotation angle is then found by minimizing the cost function using the gradient search algorithm. The obtained simulation results show considerable improvement over the conventional unrotated system","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4085644/4037317/04085792.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2006.301497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2006.301497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4085792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation Optimization for MPSK/MQAM Signal Constellations Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constellation diagram","Fading","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Phase shift keying","Interleaved codes","Cost function","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation","Modulation coding","Quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","gradient methods","modulation coding","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation optimization","quadrature amplitude modulation","MPSK-MQAM signal constellations","Rayleigh fading channels","uncoded phase-shift-keying","coded modulation techniques","block-fading single-input-single-output","SISO wireless communication channels","symbol error probability","SEP","cost function minimisation","gradient search algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Rotation Optimization for MPSK/MQAM Signal Constellations Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4085792/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308836","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation Optimization for MPSK/MQAM Signal Constellations Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICCS-00-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064163S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085644","isNumber":"4037317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085644","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4037317","articleId":"4085792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4085803,"authors":[{"name":"Sutharshan Rajasegarar","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Center for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Sutharshan","lastName":"Rajasegarar","id":"37403126000"},{"name":"Christopher Leckie","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Center for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Leckie","id":"37269767100"},{"name":"Marimuthu Palaniswami","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Center for Ultra-Broadband Information Networks, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Marimuthu","lastName":"Palaniswami","id":"38320621600"},{"name":"James C.

For a DL-centered data service, time division duplex-code division multiple access (TDD-CDMA) and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) are promising techniques. Furthermore, overlay systems not only expand the coverage, but enhance the network and user throughputs. Specifically with TDD-CDMA, each overlay system can re-use the same frequency band, and therefore an efficient frequency usage is achievable while overlay networks interfere with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel time slot configuration over the TDD-CDMA overlay system for high-speed DL access. In our system, micro base stations (microBSs) are equipped with directional antennas to alleviate the strong BS-microBS interference and AMC is also used to gain the synergy effect between the proposed slot configuration and AMC.

The nature of independent time-varying channels across different users in a multi-user wireless system provides multi-user diversity. In addition, multiple antennas that spatially separate the signals from different users can be used to provide multiple access gain. Combining fair scheduling and efficient antenna assignment, we can achieve the goal of fairness and maximum capacity. For antenna assignment, because of the variation of channel conditions especially in the case of mobility of users we propose a novel scheme considering the behavior of MIMO systems with low complexity.

Our analysis shows that the mean-squared error (MSE) of a ML estimator is linearly related to the effective length of channel impulse response, M. Tracking the variation of M is thus very important for conventional MLE. But, incorporating a run-time update of M into the ML estimator turns out to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation scheme which is less M-dependent. This scheme combines ML estimation and frequency-domain smoothing systematically based on a simple iterative structure.

The resource allocation problem is modelled as a cooperative game where a fairness criterion is enforced in the bargaining outcome of the game. Given a minimum rate requirement for each user, Nash bargaining model ensures all users to attain their minimum rate requirements. If a set of maximum rate requirement is also provided, Raiffa-Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining model regulates the bargaining outcome to consider both the minimum and maximum requirements of all users. The main interest of the cooperative game is to achieve a Pareto optimal outcome. In this paper, we proposed a reduced complexity algorithm to achieve transmission rates as close as possible to the Pareto optimal rates.

On the other hand, receive beamforming can exploit the spatial correlation. In order to avoid the blackout caused by the high correlation, we propose a scheme that switches between beamforming and STBC (SBS) with explicit switching criteria to dynamically accommodate the changing channel correlation. In the further discussion, we find that the switching criterion results in the undesirably frequent switching when the Doppler frequency increases. As a result, we propose a statistical criterion to achieve a much lower switching frequency while keeping almost the same performance as the previously proposed scheme.

The use of a structural similarity measure for tracking is proposed. The measure reflects the distance between two images by comparing their structural and spatial characteristics and has shown to be robust to illumination and contrast changes. As a result it guarantees robustness of the tracking process under changes in the environment. The previously used Bhattacharyya distance is not robust to such changes. Additionally, when a tracker is run with the Bhattacharyya distance, histograms should be calculated in order to find the likelihood function of the measurements. With the new function there is no need to calculate histograms. A particle filter (PF) is implemented where this measure is used for computing the distance between the reference and current frame.

In absence of reference images, the current protocols recommend to degrade spatially both sets of images and to perform fusion on these two new sets, thus producing synthesized images at the original low resolution. The quality budget is drawn at this scale and it is assumed that it is close to or worse than the one, which would have been drawn at high resolution if the reference images were available. This extrapolation hypothesis is the major limitation of the application of protocols. The validity of this hypothesis is studied for 44 case studies. Several distances are selected. They are compounded into several quality budgets, each of them giving an overall idea on the quality. We analyze changes in quality budgets with scales. It is found that the extrapolation hypothesis is validated in most cases.

The multi-target VDA (MT-VDA) formulation retains the main features of the VDA approach while generalizing the notion of a trellis to cover multiple target to measurement data association hypotheses. The cost metric for the problem is developed in terms of the multi-target association likelihood. Application of the Viterbi algorithm results in an efficient pruning strategy that can be represented graphically on a trellis.

The assumed unknowns in the adaptive estimator are the process noise covariance elements. Parameter elements generated from a quasi-random sequence are used to drive multiple-model parallel filters for state estimation. The current approach focuses on estimating the process noise covariance by sequentially updating weights associated with the quasi-random elements through the calculation of the likelihood function of the measurement-minus-estimate residuals, which also incorporates correlations between various measurement times. For linear Gaussian measurement processes the likelihood function is easily determined. For nonlinear Gaussian measurement processes, it is assumed that the linearized output sufficiently captures the statistics of the likelihood function by making the small noise assumption. Simulation results, involving a two-dimensional target tracking problem using an extended Kalman filter, indicate that the new approach is able to correctly estimate the noise statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4085937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9273975","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4085937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation Using an Autocorrelation Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation Using an Autocorrelation Approach","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"ICIF-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059833S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085846","isNumber":"4042156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085846","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4042156","articleId":"4085937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIFIEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":4085942,"authors":[{"name":"Maynard J.

At the event level, learning provides the capability to detect (and alert) upon anomalous behavior. At a higher (inter-event) level, learning enables predictions, over pre-defined time horizons, to be made about future vessel location. Predictions can also be used to alert on anomalous behavior.

Most of the papers on the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator use a constant Markov chain transition probability matrix (TPM) corresponding to a constant measurement sampling interval. However, a multi-sensor ground target tracking system usually employs ground moving target indicator radar, electro-optical, infrared, video, acoustic, and seismic sensors, for which the sampling intervals are different. Modeling such systems requires using a variable sampling interval in the IMM estimator, which in turn requires the use of a non-constant TPM. An analytic expression for the TPM with variable sampling interval exists for two dynamic models. When the number of dynamic models is greater than two, the TPM can be numerically calculated efficiently. We present the technical approach for the IMM estimator with variable sampling intervals.

The rationale is that the normalized mutual information calculated either between any couple of bands, or between each MS band and the Pan image, should be unchanged after fusion, i.e., when passing from the coarse scale of the MS data to the fine scale of the Pan image. Experimental results carried out on QuickBird and Ikonos data demonstrate that the results provided by the proposed information-theoretic method are in trend with analysis performed on spatially degraded data by means of such parameters as Walds's ERGAS, Wang and Bovik's QI, and the novel Q4 score index based on quaternion theory and recently proposed by the authors.

Since the Mahalanobis distances between measurements collected on closely-spaced targets and tracks are similar, several elements of the corresponding kinematic measurement-to-track cost matrix are also similar. Lacking any other information upon which to base assignments, it is not surprising that data association algorithms make mistakes. This paper compares five methods for incorporating amplitude information to improve data association for multi-target tracking with Rayleigh targets. Two simple scenarios are used to demonstrate the impact of each method on measurement-to-track data association. None of the five methods perform best across the board. The analysis suggests that selection of a method for incorporating target amplitude information should be application-dependent","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4086066/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9274103","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of methods for using target amplitude to improve measurement-to-track association in multi-target tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of methods for using target amplitude to improve measurement-to-track association in multi-target tracking","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"ICIF-00-220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038326S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4085846","isNumber":"4042156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4085846","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4042156","articleId":"4086066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4086127,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Nethercote","firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Nethercote","id":"37079251700"},{"name":"Robert Walsh","firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Walsh","id":"38118416800"},{"name":"Jeremy Fitzhardinge","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Fitzhardinge","id":"38131109100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0508-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4086127","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":346},"abstract":"Summary form only given. Workload characterization relies heavily on robust and powerful tools to quickly and accurately gather and analyse large amounts of data about program executions. Valgrind is a dynamic binary instrumentation framework for building program analysis tools. Valgrind is best known for a tool, Memcheck, that finds memory errors common in C and C++ programs, but its ability to instrument every instruction and system call a program executes, and inspect every value a program manipulates, without slowing down program execution excessively, makes it an excellent platform for buildings tools suitable for workload characterization. In this tutorial, we introduce Valgrind, describing how you can use it to create powerful tools for doing profiling and trace collection, and to help characterize how workloads affect different machine aspects such as instruction set architecture, the memory hierarchy, and I/O. Valgrind provides powerful analysis tools without excessive slow-down, which allows very large workloads to be analysed easily. Valgrind is open-source (GPL) software, available on x86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux, and work is underway to support other platforms. Valgrind tools are regularly used by the developers of many software packages, such as Firefox, OpenOffice, KDE, GNOME, MySQL, Perl, Python, PHP, Samba, RenderMan, SAS, The GIMP, Unreal Tournament, Squid, plus many scientific applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086118/4086119/04086127.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2006.302723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2006.302723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4086119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\"Building Workload Characterization Tools with Valgrind\"","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linux","Instruments","Open source software","Robustness","Buildings","Computer architecture","Memory architecture","Software packages","Synthetic aperture sonar","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program diagnostics","public domain software","software tools","storage management","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workload characterization tools","Valgrind","data analysis","program executions","dynamic binary instrumentation","program analysis tools","Memcheck","memory errors","C programs","C++ programs","instruction set architecture","memory hierarchy","open-source software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"\"Building Workload Characterization Tools with Valgrind\"","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442352","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\"Building Workload Characterization Tools with Valgrind\"","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IISWC-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036047S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086118","isNumber":"4086119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086118","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4086119","articleId":"4086127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4086136,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Hoste","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Hoste","id":"37936405800"},{"name":"Lieven Eeckhout","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"Eeckhout","id":"37266694200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0509-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0508-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4086136","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":527},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microarchitecture","Hardware","Microprocessors","Counting circuits","Application software","Performance analysis","Biometrics","Bioinformatics","Process design","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","computer architecture","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microarchitecture-independent characteristics","benchmark characterization","inherent program characteristics","8-dimensional space","benchmark suites comparison","workload characterization","microarchitecture-dependent characterization","microarchitecture-independent characterization","47-dimensional space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086136","abstract":"Understanding the behavior of emerging workloads is important for designing next generation microprocessors. For addressing this issue, computer architects and performance analysts build benchmark suites of new application domains and compare the behavioral characteristics of these benchmark suites against well-known benchmark suites. Current practice typically compares workloads based on microarchitecture-dependent characteristics generated from running these workloads on real hardware. There is one pitfall though with comparing benchmarks using microarchitecture-dependent characteristics, namely that completely different inherent program behavior may yield similar microarchitecture-dependent behavior. This paper proposes a methodology for characterizing benchmarks based on microarchitecture-independent characteristics. This methodology minimizes the number of inherent program characteristics that need to be measured by exploiting correlation between program characteristics. In fact, we reduce our 47-dimensional space to an 8-dimensional space without compromising the methodology's ability to compare benchmarks. The important benefits of this methodology are that (i) only a limited number of microarchitecture-independent characteristics need to be measured, and (ii) the resulting workload characterization is easy to interpret. Using this methodology we compare 122 benchmarks from 6 recently proposed benchmark suites. We conclude that some benchmarks in emerging benchmark suites are indeed similar to benchmarks from well-known benchmark suites as suggested through a microarchitecture-dependent characterization. However, other benchmarks are dissimilar based on a microarchitecture-independent characterization although a microarchitecture-dependent characterization suggests the opposite to be true","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2006.302732","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086118/4086119/04086136.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2006.302732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4086119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Benchmarks Using Key Microarchitecture-Independent Characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Benchmarks Using Key Microarchitecture-Independent Characteristics","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9442360","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086136/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Benchmarks Using Key Microarchitecture-Independent Characteristics","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IISWC-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074817S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086118","isNumber":"4086119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086118","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4086119","articleId":"4086136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4086137,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua J.

However, if the architect chooses a subset of benchmarks that is not representative, the subsequent simulation results will, at best, be misleading or, at worst, yield incorrect conclusions. To address this problem, computer architects have recently proposed several statistically-based approaches to subset a benchmark suite. While some of these approaches are well-grounded statistically, what has not yet been thoroughly evaluated is the: 1) absolute accuracy; 2) relative accuracy across a range of processor and memory subsystem enhancements; and 3) representativeness and coverage of each approach for a range of subset sizes. Specifically, this paper evaluates statistically-based subsetting approaches based on principal components analysis (PCA) and the Plackett and Burman (P&B) design, in addition to prevailing approaches such as integer vs. floating-point, core vs. memory-bound, by language, and at random. Our results show that the two statistically-based approaches, PCA and P&B, have the best absolute and relative accuracy for CPI and energy-delay product (EDP), produce subsets that are the most representative, and choose benchmark and input set pairs that are most well-distributed across the benchmark space. To achieve a 5% absolute CPI and EDP error, across a wide range of configurations, PCA and P&B typically need about 17 benchmark and input set pairs, while the other five approaches often choose more than 30 benchmark and input set pairs","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2006.302733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2006.302733","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086118/4086119/04086137.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4086119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating Benchmark Subsetting Approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluating Benchmark Subsetting Approaches","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9442361","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating Benchmark Subsetting Approaches","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IISWC-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098579S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086118","isNumber":"4086119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086118","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4086119","articleId":"4086137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4086142,"authors":[{"name":"Darshan D.

We take soft-error tolerance one step further and examine when an application can tolerate errors that are not masked. For example, a video decoder or approximation algorithm can tolerate errors if the user is willing to accept degraded output. The key observation is that while the decoder can tolerate error in its data, it can not tolerate error in its control. We first present static analysis that protects most control operations. We examine several SPEC CPU2000 and MiBench benchmarks for error tolerance, develop fidelity measures for each, and quantify the effect of errors on fidelity. We show that protecting control is crucial to producing error-tolerance, for without this protection, many applications experience catastrophic errors (infinite execution time or crashing).

Other impairments like thermal noise, impulse noise and cross talk also cause further distortions to the received symbols. Adaptive equalization of the digital channels at the receiver removes/reduces the effects of such ISIs and attempts to recover the transmitted symbols. The multilayer perceptron (MLP), fuzzy logic (FL) and radial basis function (RBF) based equalizers are relatively new soft computing based equalizers which aim to minimize the ISI present in the channels particularly for nonlinear channels. However they suffer from long training time and undesirable local minima. In the present paper we propose a new adaptive channel equalizer using a novel bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) technique which is essentially a derivative free optimization tool. This algorithm has been suitably used to update the weights of the equalizer. The performance of the proposed equalizer has been evaluated and has been compared with its LMS based counter part. It is observed that the new equalizer offers improved performance both in terms of rate of convergence as well as bit-error-rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086232/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9398312","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086232/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Development of a New Adaptive Channel Equalizer using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Development of a New Adaptive Channel Equalizer using Bacterial Foraging Optimization Technique","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"INDCON-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139965S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086217","isNumber":"4086218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086217","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4086218","articleId":"4086232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086233,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Sharma","affiliation":["Electronics Department, Government Polytechnic College, Alwar, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4086217/4086218/4086233/4086233-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manish Sharma has received the B.E. degree from M.B.M.

The system consists of an uncontrolled rectifier and AC controller as the non-linear loads, with an active filter to compensate for the harmonic current injected by the load. The active filter is based on a single-phase inverter with four controllable switches, a standard H-bridge inverter. The AC side of the inverter is connected in parallel with the other nonlinear loads through a filter inductance. The DC side of the inverter is connected to a filter capacitor. The neural PI controller is used to shape the current through the filter inductor such that the line current is in phase with and of the same shape as the input voltage. The spectral analysis of the supply current shows the harmonics produced by the load has been successfully compensated by the active filter. The system is modeled in Matlab Simulink and simulation results prove that the injected harmonics are greatly reduced and system efficiency and power factor are improved","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086323/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9408364","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086323/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Controlled Shunt Active Power Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Controlled Shunt Active Power Filter","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"INDCON-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054473S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","isNumber":"4086218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086217","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4086323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086326,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnan Nallaperumal","affiliation":["Centre for Information Technology and Engineering, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4086217/4086218/4086326/4086326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nallaperumal Krishnan received M.Sc. degree in Mathematics from Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, India in 1985, M.Tech degree in Computer and Information Sciences from Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, India in 1988 and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli.

In this paper, a watermarking scheme is proposed in which the image is decomposed in to wavelet coefficients and a visual recognizable logo and content based watermark information is embedded in the wavelet coefficients. The wavelet coefficients corresponding to the points located in a neighborhood that have maximum entropy are used for embedding the visual logo and the relations between the neighboring coefficients in the selected wavelet sub bands are embedded into middle frequency pairs of the first scale coefficients. This method embeds the maximum amount of watermark while the watermark is imperceptible. This technique provides two levels of protection while maintaining the image quality. The embedding of relation coefficients provide the capability to identify malicious changes made on the image. The experimental results confirm that the proposed techniques provide secure watermarking and robust to a variety of attacks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Annual IEEE India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086217/4086218/04086326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2006 Annual IEEE India Conference","doi":"10.1109/INDCON.2006.302855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDCON.2006.302855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4086218","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wavelet Transform Based Digital Image Watermarking and Authentication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Digital images","Watermarking","Authentication","Wavelet coefficients","Image recognition","Entropy","Frequency","Protection","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","image coding","image recognition","maximum entropy methods","telecommunication security","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital image watermarking","authentication","wavelet transform","multimedia data image","visual recognizable logo embedding","maximum entropy","secure watermarking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital watermarking","authentication","Wavelet Transform","Entropy","Feature extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Wavelet Transform Based Digital Image Watermarking and Authentication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086326/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408367","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wavelet Transform Based Digital Image Watermarking and Authentication","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"INDCON-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119539S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086217","isNumber":"4086218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086217","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4086218","articleId":"4086326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086336,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Geirhofer","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Geirhofer","id":"37294022800"},{"name":"Lang Tong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Lang","lastName":"Tong","id":"37276976900"},{"name":"Brian M.

Realizing that exploiting the under-utilization of the channel requires a good model of the these users' medium access, we propose a continuous-time semi-Markov model that captures the WLAN's behavior yet remains tractable enough to be used for deriving optimal control strategies within a decision-theoretic framework. Our model is based on actual measurements in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using a vector signal analyzer to collect complex baseband data. We explore two different sensing strategies to identify spectrum opportunities depending on whether the primary user's transmission scheme is known. The collected data is used to statistically characterize the idle and busy periods of the channel. Furthermore, we show that a continuous-time semi-Markov model is able to capture the data with good accuracy. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to validate the model and to assess the model's goodness-of-fit quantitatively.

A stochastic impulse response function can be used to model different random parameters like channel fluctuation, variable transmission power of the nodes etc. However, for a decaying power law, all the moments of the interference diverge. In this paper, we extend the 2D shot noise model to represent a modified power law that is not only more realistic but also allows for finite moments for the interference. For this model, we present performance curves for the AWGN channel with and without variable transmission power at the nodes as well as for the fading channel. Then, we impose a guard zone around each receiver node in the network, modify the shot noise model to this channel access scheme and demonstrate the improvement in per-node throughput that a guard zone is capable of providing","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086349.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shot Noise Models for Outage and Throughput Analyses in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Mobile ad hoc networks","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Interference","Ad hoc networks","Stochastic resonance","Fluctuations","AWGN channels","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","AWGN channels","fading channels","radiofrequency interference","shot noise","stochastic processes","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shot noise model","wireless ad hoc network","decaying power law","network self-interference","Poisson point process","stochastic impulse response function","channel fluctuation","variable transmission power","finite moment","AWGN channel","fading channel","guard zone","channel access scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Shot Noise Models for Outage and Throughput Analyses in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086349/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419020","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shot Noise Models for Outage and Throughput Analyses in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07797S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4086352,"authors":[{"name":"Zafar Q.

The first step redistributes the power level across all subcarriers, which slightly reduces the error robustness of the system, while the second step ensures the subcarrier power distribution obeys a subband power constraint. The resulting power levels satisfy spectrum regulatory requirements across the transmission spectrum while simultaneously reducing the PAPR and maintaining a degree of error robustness. Since no overhead information is required, the proposed algorithm does not incur a throughput penalty.

This implies a level of synchronization across the network. Synchronization is also needed to support the network goals, such as event detection and reporting. In this paper, we review the problem of wireless sensor network synchronization and associated key issues, including the fundamental signal processing tasks needed, such as estimation of the skew and offset between two clocks, round trip delay estimation, extension of synchronization to multiple nodes, as well as performance analysis and bounds","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302459","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086370.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization in Sensor Networks: an Overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization in Sensor Networks: an Overview","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086370/","accessionNumber":"9419035","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086370/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization in Sensor Networks: an Overview","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048879S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4086380,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288835800"},{"name":"Daoben Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Daoben","lastName":"Li","id":"37277108000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086380","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086380","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Downlink","Maximum likelihood detection","Multiuser detection","Frequency","Diversity methods","Gold","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","fading channels","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-diversity spreading code","multicarrier CDMA system","maximum-likelihood multiuser detection","ML-MUD","frequency selective fading channel"]}],"abstract":"The paper proposes a method to construct full-diversity spreading codes for the multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) systems based on evaluation of the maximum-likelihood multi-user detection (ML-MUD) performance in the frequency selective fading channels.

UWB random noise radar is well-known for its LPD and LPI properties. Notch filtering is used to fragment this radar's band-limited random noise transmit signal and the intermediate bandwidth so obtained is used for establishing a covert wireless multi-user communication platform between the radars. This being the primary goal of this paper, we prove that the radar's detection and ranging function can occur simultaneously with data communication. Our results also show that embedding OFDM symbols into the intermediate bandwidth not only preserves the random nature of the transmitted signal but also lets the receiver retrieve the embedded data from the noise-data radar received signal. Next, the CDF of the camouflaged noise-data signal can be made to look very similar to the CDF of a Gaussian random noise signal, by proper adjustments to the number of carriers used in the OFDM symbol. This CDF can be used as a metric to measure the covertness of this system. Further, the effect of this tradeoff on the BER of the system can be brought into allowable limits with the use of OFDM-based data redundancy technique. Now, using this deterministic ally fragmented noise spectrum as the communication channel and OFDMA/FDD as a multiplexing technique, a number of such noise radars can be configured to form an ad-hoc multi-radar wireless network. An algorithm in this regard is also presented. Thus, as seen by any hostile target, the transmitted noise-data waveform appears random and noise-like. However, for the radar sensors in the network, this noise-like signal contains camouflaged information","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086383.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covert Netted Wireless Noise Radar Sensor: OFDMA-Based Communication Architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","OFDM","Gaussian noise","Ad hoc networks","Ultra wideband radar","Filtering","Radar detection","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","bandlimited signals","frequency division multiple access","Gaussian noise","notch filters","OFDM modulation","radar detection","ultra wideband radar","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless noise radar sensor","OFDMA-based communication architecture","ad-hoc network","UWB signal","LPD property","LPI property","notch filtering","band-limited signal","multiuser communication","radar detection","Gaussian random noise signal","BER","data redundancy technique","communication channel","FDD multiplexing technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Covert Netted Wireless Noise Radar Sensor: OFDMA-Based Communication Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086383/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419042","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covert Netted Wireless Noise Radar Sensor: OFDMA-Based Communication Architecture","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072589S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4086389,"authors":[{"name":"The-hanh Pham","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"The-hanh","lastName":"Pham","id":"37287422500"},{"name":"A.

Because of their size and weight, small aperture terminals are very attractive in such communications on the move applications. These terminals have wide beamwidths and may increase interference to adjacent satellite systems. Also, motion induced antenna pointing errors are unavoidable in communications on the move systems and these will increase the interference level to adjacent satellites. In order to limit interference to adjacent satellite systems, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have established strict recommendations and rules on the off-axis emissions and antenna gain patterns. These recommendations and rules do not account for the motion induced antenna pointing errors and, in the presence of such errors, the transmit power spectral density from these terminals will be so small that only very low data rates can be realized. In order to facilitate communications on the move systems, a modification to the relevant existing ITU recommendations was proposed. In this paper we will examine the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of communications on the move systems subject to those suggested modifications. Analysis carried out in this paper shows that the motion induced antenna errors can have a significant impact on the BER performance","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086396.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Satellite Communications On The Move Systems in the Presence of Antenna Pointing Errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite communication","Satellite antennas","Interference","Artificial satellites","FCC","Bit error rate","Apertures","Transmitting antennas","Performance analysis","Motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on the move satellite communication","antenna pointing error","interference limitation","International Telecommunications Union","ITU","Federal Communications Commission","FCC","bit-error-rate","BER performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Satellite Communications On The Move Systems in the Presence of Antenna Pointing Errors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419053","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Satellite Communications On The Move Systems in the Presence of Antenna Pointing Errors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053415S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086397,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37401031400"},{"name":"Yao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37932760100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086397","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Delay","Equalizers","Broadband communication","Mobile communication","Radio transmitters","Interference","Modems","Frequency division multiplexing","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","broadband networks","channel coding","decoding","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","time-varying channels","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain turbo equalization","mobile broadband communication","time-varying radio channel","multipath delay spread","space-time block transmission","single carrier modulation","intersymbol interference","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","minimum mean-square error","channel decoder"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates mobile broadband communications, which undergo time-varying radio channels with large multipath delay spread.

In this paper, we investigated the crucial, yet not well discussed issue to jointly design beamforming weights for all transmitters, subject to total transmission power constraints, under the assumption that all users' channel state information (CSI) is available at each of the users. We proposed a class of orthogonal joint beamforming design schemes with matched filter receiver, and an eigen-beamforming (Eig-BF) scheme with ordered successive interference cancellation minimum mean square error receiver (OSIC-MMSE). By comparing these schemes with the optimal joint transceiver design with optimality in terms of overall mean square error (MSE), we show that Eig-BF OSIC-MMSE scheme achieves near-optimum performance at much lower complexity and with much simpler transmitter design, since it only requires each transmitter to know its own CSI and thus can be implemented in a decentralized way. This indicates that marginal performance improvement can be benefited from making all transmitters share their CSI.

Through finite-rate feedback from the access point, users acquire quantized channel state information. The goal is to map channel quantization states to adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) modes and allocate optimally time slots to users so that transmit-power is minimized. To this end, we develop two joint quantization and resource allocation approaches. In the first one, we rely on the quantization regions associated to each AMC mode and the time allocation policy inherited from the perfect CSI case to optimize the fixed transmit-power across quantization states. In the second approach, we pursue separable optimization and resort to coordinate descent algorithms to solve the following two sub-problems: (a) given a time allocation, we optimize the quantization regions and transmit-powers; and (b) with improved quantization regions, we optimize the time allocation policy. Numerical results are present to evaluate the energy savings and compare the novel approaches.","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086408.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient TDMA with Quantized Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient TDMA with Quantized Channel State Information","htmlLink":"/document/4086408/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient TDMA with Quantized Channel State Information","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069684S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086424,"authors":[{"name":"Danijela Cabric","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Danijela","lastName":"Cabric","id":"37271490100"},{"name":"Artem Tkachenko","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Artem","lastName":"Tkachenko","id":"37294605700"},{"name":"Robert W.

The new algorithm requires a fraction of an effort to achieve a near-optimal performance in comparison with other near-optimal detection schemes","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.301996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.301996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity Stack-Based Limited Tree Searching Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity Stack-Based Limited Tree Searching Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems","htmlLink":"/document/4086426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9419068","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity Stack-Based Limited Tree Searching Algorithm for V-BLAST Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059436S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4086436,"authors":[{"name":"Yohan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293234200"},{"name":"Dong Ku Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086436","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Channel estimation","Receiving antennas","Base stations","Fading","Feedback","Estimation error","Downlink","Analysis of variance","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","diversity reception","fading channels","multiuser channels","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic beamforming","OBF","multiuser diversity","fading channel","channel estimation error","conservative link adaptation","two-fold performance improvement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086436","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302025","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","abstract":"Opportunistic beamforming (OBF) offers a way to provide the multiuser diversity in slow fading channel by using randomly generated beam weights, leading to the substantial reduction of the required feedback from users.

Moreover, the multicast capability of communications is going to be of great interest, especially in new military wireless environments for the digitized battlefield. Indeed, tactical MANETs, where large networks can be deployed, also add scalability constraints when designing a multicast routing protocol. Currently, the best response to scalability in ad hoc networks is to gather nodes into groups as a result of a clustering algorithm. The work of this paper focuses on solving the two related challenges: to achieve efficient and adaptive multicast communications firstly inside each cluster and secondly among the clusters. This paper presents a solution regarding the first challenge. We propose shared-tree ad hoc multicast protocol (STAMP), a core-based multicast routing protocol independent from the underlying unicast routing protocol. Compared to other shared-tree multicast protocols, STAMP achieves good performance even under mobility since it takes advantage from the broadcast capacity of the medium to deliver data on the tree (data forwarding based on mesh principles). Discrete event simulations were run to evaluate and to compare our method to other existing solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicast protocols","Routing protocols","Mobile ad hoc networks","Scalability","Bandwidth","Network topology","Mobile communication","Military communication","Ad hoc networks","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","discrete event simulation","military communication","mobile radio","multicast protocols","routing protocols","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile network","tactical MANET","dynamic topology characteristics","military wireless environment","digitized battlefield","scalability","clustering algorithm","shared-tree ad hoc multicast protocol","STAMP","core-based multicast routing protocol","broadcast capacity","discrete event simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302031","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086442.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STAMP: Shared-Tree Ad Hoc Multicast Protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"STAMP: Shared-Tree Ad Hoc Multicast Protocol","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086442/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086442/","accessionNumber":"9407443","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STAMP: Shared-Tree Ad Hoc Multicast Protocol","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050892S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4086443,"authors":[{"name":"Marilynn P.

Subsequent to Laurent's work, it was shown that commensurate expressions could be obtained for multilevel and multi-h CPM, but with an exponential increase in the total number of PAM component pulses in the signal representation. In this paper, we derive a generalization of Laurent's result which can be universally applied to all variants of CPM which use a non-integer modulation index.

Spectral efficiency gains promised by spatial multiplexing schemes, such as vertical Bell Labs space time (V-BLAST) and space-division multiple access (SDMA), are difficult to realize for military applications where extreme channel conditions such as co-channel interference and intentional jamming can be expected. We show that the MSWF combined with successive interference (SIC) for spatial demultiplexing leads to significant signal subspace compression or rank-reduction. We propose for the MSWF-SIC a novel rank-reduction stopping rule that adapts to channel correlation and interference converges much faster than full rank methods permitting shorter training length and robustness to co-channel interference and jamming. Also, significant computational reduction is realized making this method a good candidate for portable applications where computational resources are limited. Bit error rate (BER) versus SNR for the correlated channel and for co-channel interference and SINR versus the MSWF rank-reduction and length of training interval are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086453.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank MIMO Decoder for Military Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Military communication","Interchannel interference","Jamming","Portable computers","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Wiener filter","Multiaccess communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank MIMO Decoder for Military Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086453/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank MIMO Decoder for Military Communications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065444S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086456,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

This new capability has inspired many novel application ideas in UAV networking. We argue that field experimentation of UAV networking is essential in collecting link measurement data, developing network protocols and applications, and evaluating their performance in realistic environments, and that it is feasible to conduct these experiments cost-effectively with COTS-based equipment. We describe several ongoing field experiments and initial results. Lastly, we briefly describe future testing plans as well as suggest methods of facilitating rapid and inexpensive UAV networking field experimentation","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086461.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Experimentation of Cots-Based UAV Networking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Protocols","USA Councils","Laboratories","Wireless LAN","Testing","Throughput","Banking","Interference","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","military communication","protocols","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["COTS-based UAV network","commercial off-the-shelf wireless equipment","unmanned aerial vehicle","field experimentation","link measurement data","network protocol","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Field Experimentation of Cots-Based UAV Networking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086461/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418759","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Experimentation of Cots-Based UAV Networking","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.156052S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086479,"authors":[{"name":"V.

However, in the presence of atmospheric turbulence the FSO channel will be distorted and this limits the effective data rate that can be transmitted over the link. These distortions can affect the signal in the spatial, time and wavelength (frequency) domains. It is well known that channel coding and diversity techniques can be employed to mitigate the channel distortions and improve the performance of the communication link. For these techniques to be effectively utilized the FSO channel properties have to be characterized. In this paper we will examine the correlation of the FSO channel across wavelengths under the weak turbulence propagation model.

The ACE requirements are specified for both the 5 kHz and 25 kHz channels, in terms of relative energy spilling out in adjacent channels above and below the main transmitting channel. The two main modulations recommended by the mil standard are 50% SBPSK and 50% SOQPSK. The SOQPSK technique offers outstanding side lobe suppression such that the ACE requirements are readily met with the standard 50% SOQPSK waveform. The 50% shaped SBPSK waveform as recommended in MIL-STD-188-181A, however does not offer much ACE margin in the first two 5 kHz offset channels, nor for 9600 bps in the first two 25 kHz offset channels. Hardware limitations may further degrade ACE performance. This paper introduces new phase shaping methods that have far superior ACE suppressions with little or no additional modem implementation loss when the transmitted waveform is demodulated by a coherent BPSK demodulator. The new shaping waveforms introduced in this paper use a piece-wise-linear approach to generate the phase transitions. The phase transitions from zero to pi are achieved by using different straight lines with different slopes. There is no phase discontinuity in the transition phase trajectory thus translating to continuous M-ary frequency shift keying type of waveform. The choice of these slopes can predictably reshape the RF modulated power spectral density, thus the slopes control the ACE characteristics of the transmitted RF signal. The transition time can vary from zero to the full baud time, thus achieving the zero to 100% shaping. The ACE characteristics are predicted by a computer model, then verified via spectral measurement of the transmitted RF signal. This transmitted RF signal is fed to an off-the-shelf RF receiver/demodulator and BER measurements are obtained. Computer simulation results show good agreement with measured experimental results in terms of both ACE characteristics and modem implementation loss","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302127","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Piece-Wise-Linear SBPSK Modulation Waveform with Robust Adjacent Channel Emissions for UHF SATCOM Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Piece-Wise-Linear SBPSK Modulation Waveform with Robust Adjacent Channel Emissions for UHF SATCOM Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086506/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418851","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4086506/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Piece-Wise-Linear SBPSK Modulation Waveform with Robust Adjacent Channel Emissions for UHF SATCOM Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055875S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086511,"authors":[{"name":"Shupeng Li","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shupeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37292198300"},{"name":"Sudhir Ramakrishna","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhir","lastName":"Ramakrishna","id":"37366128300"},{"name":"Ashok Rudrapatna","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Rudrapatna","id":"37612259400"},{"name":"Nirwan Ansari","affiliation":["Advanced Network Laboratory, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Nirwan","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37279350900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086511","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"There is an effort by the 3GPP2 (third generation partnership project 2) standards body to continue to evolve the current evolution data-optimized 3G (EVDO) system into Revision C (EVDO Rev.

The design goals include achieving much higher spectral efficiency and peak rates, at the same time providing flexibility, backward compatibility and maintaining low complexity in the base stations and mobile systems. OFDM based technologies are promising candidates for this evolution. However, one of the main disadvantages of OFDM is the high time domain peak-to-average power ratio.

Whether changes in link margin are predictable (i.e. weather conditions or mission profiles) or truly random (i.e. atmospheric turbulence induced scintillation or boundary layer induced tracking errors), FSO communication systems will experience a large dynamic range of performance through most mission scenarios. Recent system designs within commercial, academic, and military organizations have focused on leveraging COTS technology from the fiber optic telecommunications industry. These systems are typically based on fixed designs that use set data rates and modulation formats. Utilizing such modalities in a mobile free-space environment can lead to systems that are either overly conservative or have a high rate of failure. To maximize overall system efficiency, we propose a transceiver architecture with rate and modulation agility. The presented transceiver is built with COTS components, supports data rate adjustability, and can switch modulation formats between differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), binary pulse-position modulation (BPPM), and on-off-keying (OOK).

In this work, we propose different error concealment schemes to handle packet losses at the decoder. At the encoder we have developed a method for the estimation of the video distortion at the receiver for given channel conditions. We show the performance of our distortion estimation algorithm in comparison with simulated video transmission over wireless channels with packet errors. In the proposed system, we use a MIMO system with orthogonal space-time block codes (O-STBC) that provides spatial diversity and guarantees independent transmission of different symbols within the block code. Rate-compatible turbo codes (RCPT) are used for unequal error protection of the scalable layers. In the proposed constrained bandwidth allocation framework, we use the estimated decoder distortion to optimally select the application layer parameters, i.e. quantization parameter (QP) and group of pictures (GOP) size, and physical layer parameters, i.e. RCPT and symbol constellation. Also, the simulation results show the substantial performance gain by using different symbol constellations across the scalable layers as compared to a fixed constellation","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel allocation","MIMO","Decoding","Block codes","Codecs","Scalability","Turbo codes","Error correction codes","Quantization","Quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","block codes","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","turbo codes","video codecs","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal bandwidth allocation","scalable video transmission","MIMO system","H. 264 codec","error concealment scheme","orthogonal space-time block code","O-STBC","spatial diversity","rate-compatible turbo code","RCPT","unequal error protection","quantization parameter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419100","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Bandwidth Allocation for Scalable H.264 Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06501S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4086530,"authors":[{"name":"Ahsen U.

The noise at the output of the phase demodulator (in the CE-OFDM receiver) is shown to be approximately Gaussian at high SNR and relatively low modulation indices. This allows the use of the conventional metric in the Viterbi decoding algorithm. A bound on the performance of convolutionally coded CE-OFDM is derived and is plotted along side the performance curves obtained through simulation. Both the cases with and without a phase unwrapper are studied. The phase unwrapper results in large bursts of errors at moderate to high modulation indices due to cycle slips. Such burst errors overwhelm the convolutional code and render it useless. Fewer burst errors are generated in the absence of a phase unwrapper. Further adding a simple interleaver is beneficial to counter the burst errors. It is shown that channel coding with interleaving provides good performance for CE-OFDM for low to moderate modulation indices while correcting burst errors due to phase wrapping","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant Envelope OFDM with Channel Coding","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302189","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Constant Envelope OFDM with Channel Coding","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086530/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419101","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant Envelope OFDM with Channel Coding","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063687S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086532,"authors":[{"name":"Asgeir Nysaeter","affiliation":["UniK-University Graduate Center, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Asgeir","lastName":"Nysaeter","id":"37294602800"},{"name":"Roald Otnes","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Horten, Norway"],"firstName":"Roald","lastName":"Otnes","id":"37273437900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086532","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","Frequency estimation","Interpolation","Intersymbol interference","Frequency diversity","Concatenated codes","Mean square error methods","Time varying systems","Binary codes","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel estimation","concatenated codes","equalisers","filtering theory","frequency hop communication","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-varying channels","trellis coded modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serial concatenation","2times16QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","multiple trellis coded modulation","MTCM","linear minimum mean square error","LMMSE","time-varying intersymbol interference channel","ISI","binary code","recursive TCM code","frequency hopping","linear interpolation","training sequence","iterative channel tracking","soft decoder information","channel estimation","filter-based turbo equalization"]}],"abstract":"A system with serially concatenated 2times16QAM multiple trellis coded modulation (MTCM) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) turbo equalization is proposed for an unknown and time-varying intersymbol interference (ISI) channel.

Emerging processor technology has made it possible to migrate applications that were traditionally implemented in custom silicon to general purpose processors (GPP). In the area of wireless communication, this transition has given birth to the field of software-defined and cognitive radio. Theses smart radios, or cognitive/software-defined radios (C/SDR), can potentially make more efficient use of the available RF spectrum and adapt to a wide range of protocols and environments. One of the key benefits of having a C/SDR is its ability to change communication parameters in response to changes in application needs and the radio frequency (RF) landscape. While understanding the effects of changing communication parameters is a critical precursor to the development of a predictive model, it is not the focus of this paper. This research builds upon our investigation of the effects of varying these communication parameters through the development of a predictive model.

Their importance is more pronounced in emergency and disaster situations since an inconsistent CFO estimate will result in a link failure. The CFO estimation performances of distinct consistent pilot designs can be quite different at moderate or low SNR due to different statistics of outlier which also yields a link failure. In this paper, we develop novel pilot designs that provide both consistency and robustness against outliers. We also propose new generalized pilot designs that yield consistency over any arbitrary but fixed CFO estimation range and that include our previous consistent pilot designs in H. Minn et al. (2006) as a special case which provides consistency over the maximum CFO estimation range (half of the sampling rate). Our new consistent pilot designs facilitate more flexible and economical implementation while our robust pilot designs enable wireless links with less outage and better resilience","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086545/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9419112","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086545/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust Pilot Design for Consistent Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Pilot Design for Consistent Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047258S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086550,"authors":[{"name":"David Whitefield","affiliation":["Hughes Network Systems LLC, Germantown, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Whitefield graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and gained a M.S. degree in Software Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.

SPACEWAY provides a two-way broadband \"Internet in the Sky\" IP network over satellite. It utilizes on-board regenerative processing and on-board packet switching with one-hop mesh connectivity between satellite terminals in its spot beams. This paper discusses the SPACEWAY system, its overall architecture, its network services, and its capabilities as built. It describes how the pieces of SPACEWAY are layered together to provide a complete set of end-user IP networking services. SPACEWAY has completed its system design, system deployment, and system testing for service availability in 2007. SPACEWAY implements the internationally approved ESTI/TIA/ITU standard called regenerative satellite mesh-A (RSM-A) used for two-way single-hop regenerative mesh communications. This paper further discusses how SPACEWAY can be leveraged for a low-risk DoD-grade satellite system providing communications-on-the-move (COTM), information assurance (IA), virtual private networks (VPNs), and policy management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9407481","htmlLink":"/document/4086550/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Spaceway now and in the Future: On-Board IP Packet Switching Satellte Communication Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spaceway now and in the Future: On-Board IP Packet Switching Satellte Communication Network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045205S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4086551,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37404560500"},{"name":"Stella N.

Unlike many previous works on power control and scheduling, we also investigate the impacts of Doppler spread and noisy channel estimates upon the system performance, and provide a robust system which employs a combination of power control and coding/interleaving to combat the effects of Doppler spread by exploiting the time diversity when the Doppler spread gets large. Hence, our proposed approach can function appropriately over a wide range of channel conditions","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302314","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power and Scheduling Management for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks with Delay Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086596/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power and Scheduling Management for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks with Delay Constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9407483","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086596/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Power and Scheduling Management for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks with Delay Constraints","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071041S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086608,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Sabattini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego-La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Sabattini","id":"38055132800"},{"name":"Elias Masry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego-La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Masry","id":"37294022900"},{"name":"Laurence B.

Its wide bandwidth, on the order of a few gigahertz, and its very low power spectral density, can achieve high data rates as well as good coexistence capabilities with other commercial systems. UWB systems employing sub-nanosecond waveforms benefit from a large frequency diversity, resulting in an extremely high number of resolvable multipaths. The complexity arising from the use of an optimal matched-filter receiver (i.e. RAKE receiver) can be overcome by so-called transmitted reference (TR) systems, where the receiver strategy correlates the received waveform with a dirty template. For this reason, TR systems do not need channel estimation, but are sub-optimal. On the other hand, both RAKE and TR systems need to acquire code and/or symbol synchronization. This paper presents a general code acquisition strategy that can be applied to both schemes. The estimation and acquisition in the presence of additive colored Gaussian noise are based on an approximate maximum-likelihood criterion. Several performance measures and means of comparison are presented. The probability of correct synchronization in different scenarios is presented. Moreover, the quality of the channel estimates to be used by a RAKE receiver is addressed in terms of mean-square-error. Finally, in order to compare the performance of different receiving strategies, the performance in terms of bit-error-rate is addressed","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086608.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Acquisition/Channel Estimation for UWB Communications in the Presence of Narrow-band Interference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302346","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint Acquisition/Channel Estimation for UWB Communications in the Presence of Narrow-band Interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086608/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9418866","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4086608/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Acquisition/Channel Estimation for UWB Communications in the Presence of Narrow-band Interference","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0615S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086618,"authors":[{"name":"Jiansong Chen","affiliation":["Communication Science Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Jiansong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280670200"},{"name":"Xiaoli Yu","affiliation":["Communication Science Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280833600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086618","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","MIMO","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Channel state information","Estimation error","Intersymbol interference","Signal design","Computer errors","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical Bell Labs layered space-time system","V-BLAST receiver design","multiple input multiple output","imperfect MIMO channel estimation","channel state information","CSI","zero forcing","intersymbol interference nulling","worst-case optimized zero forcing nulling","symbol detection ordering"]}],"abstract":"V-BLAST systems require perfect knowledge of the channel at the receiver, which could be impractical in real world. The channel state information (CSI) that contains the unknown estimation error will hurdle the zero forcing based intersymbol interference nulling and symbol detection ordering in V-BLAST. This paper extends the V-BLAST scheme to the imperfect CSI under the assumption that the channel estimation errors are unknown and norm-bounded. The extension consists of novel worst-case optimized zero forcing nulling and symbol detection ordering. In each layer, the zero-forcing nulling is designed to minimize the worst case error power due to the imperfect channel estimation, while the order of symbol detection is organized to detect the symbol corresponding to the best worst-case postprocessing signal over interference plus noise ratio (SINR). We have shown in computer simulations that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the standard ZF V-BLAST in the worst case CSI, while making no significant degradation in non worst-case scenarios","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302356","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-case Optimized V-BLAST Receiver Design for Imperfect MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Worst-case Optimized V-BLAST Receiver Design for Imperfect MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086618/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419162","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4086618/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-case Optimized V-BLAST Receiver Design for Imperfect MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083747S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086620,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Davis","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Davis","id":"37270200800"},{"name":"Zygmunt J.

This approach represents a very different thrust from those which attempt to circumvent the limitations of low data rate (up to 54Mb/s) and short distance (hundreds of feet) MANET nodes by software fixes such as power control, MIMO, and clever modulation schemes, which are at best stop-gap measures.

In such systems, MAI occurs if the hopping patterns of the users are not orthogonal. Under asynchronous transmission, the interference will have structure that can be exploited for interference mitigation. We apply an EM-based approach that results in an iterative algorithm to estimate the desired packet in the presence of one or more interfering signals. We compare the performance of this algorithm with that of a conventional noncoherent BFSK transceiver and show that the algorithm is particularly effective in the presence of strong interfering signals","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302384","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086627.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Detection and Estimation for Multiple Access Interference Mitigation in Asynchronous Frequency-Hop Spread Spectrum","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Multiple access interference","Spread spectrum communication","Iterative algorithms","Demodulation","Iterative decoding","Frequency modulation","Channel estimation","Convolutional codes","Frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hop communication","frequency shift keying","interference suppression","iterative methods","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative detection","multiple access interference","MAI mitigation","frequency-hop spread spectrum","binary frequency-shift keying","BFSK","asynchronous transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Detection and Estimation for Multiple Access Interference Mitigation in Asynchronous Frequency-Hop Spread Spectrum","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419170","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Detection and Estimation for Multiple Access Interference Mitigation in Asynchronous Frequency-Hop Spread Spectrum","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046208S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086631,"authors":[{"name":"Eun H.

The joint tactical radio system (JTRS) software communications architecture (SCA) promotes reuse of GPP-based software by providing a consistent framework for developing reusable waveform implementations. However, high-bandwidth waveforms, such as those used in above 2 GHz MILSATCOM terminals, overwhelm the capabilities of GPP-only radios making field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a necessity in high-bandwidth radio systems. The SCA does not address the development of reusable FPGA-based waveform implementations.

Each packet transmission includes a fixed-length acquisition preamble, and the preamble sequence used in packet transmissions is changed at predetermined times based on a sequence-generation algorithm. Two classes of sequence-generation algorithms are considered: random sequence generation, and preamble sequence generation based on m-sequences. Both are used in conjunction with a sequence-acceptance criterion based on the sidelobe energy of the preamble sequence. The tradeoff between the acquisition performance and the stringency of the acceptance criterion is examined for each sequence-generation algorithm. The computational burden of the search for an acceptable preamble sequence is also considered. It is shown that the use of the m-sequence generation algorithm results in much poorer acquisition performance for a given percentage of accepted candidate preamble sequences than is predicted using the model of a random sequence generator. Moreover, it is shown that that the tradeoff between acquisition performance and the computation required to find an acceptable preamble sequence is comparable for all of the m-sequence generators considered. Thus within the class of m-sequence generation algorithms, the use of a longer-period m-sequence generator results in a larger number of acceptable preamble sequences for a given level of acquisition performance and sequence-search computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4086682/","accessionNumber":"9407497","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Serial, Matched-Filter Packet Acquisition using a Preamble-Sequence Acceptance Criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Serial, Matched-Filter Packet Acquisition using a Preamble-Sequence Acceptance Criterion","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063509S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4086690,"authors":[{"name":"Michael B.

If the error level is low and the equalizer output is reliable then DFE is successful and all intersymbol interference (ISI) can be removed by this scheme. The block DFE scheme is tested with two blind equalization schemes (i) CMA and (ii) CMA+AMA. Their performance is compared to the original CMA/AMA scheme, and to each of the blind equalization schemes operating alone.

A conventional radio when operating in a particular communications mode always follows the same procedure and either succeeds or fails at a given task. A cognitive radio, by contrast, can have a knowledge-driven differential-response capability; that is, it can use knowledge of radio technology and policy, representations of the goals, and other contextual parameters to reason about a failed attempt to satisfy a goal and to identify alternative actions that would achieve the goal. We have built a prototype simulation framework for a cognitive radio that exhibits this capability in various scenarios.

The bit error rate (BER) has been derived which agrees well with the simulation results. Next, we present a new technique to reduce the large instantaneous envelope variations of the OFDM-CDMA signals. This approach is a simple input-power management processing with just minimal extra bandwidth for side information. It is based on the recursive-least-squares (RLS) algorithm to minimize the mean squared error of input instantaneous power and the average input power to HPA, which is shown to suppress the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) significantly and improve the system performance as a result. Finally, from the spectral behavior investigation, the present power management is shown to yield a significant adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of OFDM-CDMA System with Papr Reduction in Nonlinear Rayleigh Fading Channel","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302544","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086708.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance of OFDM-CDMA System with Papr Reduction in Nonlinear Rayleigh Fading Channel","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086708/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of OFDM-CDMA System with Papr Reduction in Nonlinear Rayleigh Fading Channel","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050123S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086715,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Hu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37280709400"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086715","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Timing","Multiaccess communication","Frequency conversion","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Fading","Sampling methods","Parameter estimation","Computational efficiency","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","frequency estimation","mean square error methods","multiuser channels","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind timing-carrier frequency offset","CFO estimator","multicarrier code division multiple access","multiuser asynchronous MC-CDMA system","frequency selective fading channel","sampling factor","decoupled subspace approach","multiuser parameter estimation","perturbation analysis","mean square error","MSE","Cramer-Rao bound","CRB","probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a joint blind timing and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for multiuser asynchronous multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems over frequency selective fading channel is proposed.

The use of decoupled subspace approach decouples the multiuser parameter estimation to multiple single user problems, thus improves the algorithm computational efficient. Using the small perturbation analysis, the approximate mean square error (MSE) in estimating CFO can be computed. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is also derived to obtain the lower bound of the CFO estimation error. The accuracy of timing estimation is measured in terms of the probability of acquisition.

To efficiently utilize the band-width left unused in a cellular system, which we denote as the primary system (PRI), we design a system with an ad hoc/mesh overlay network, which we denote as the secondary system (SEC). The basic design principle is that the SEC operates in a non-intrusive manner and does not interact with the PRI. We develop a multi-channel MAC protocol, to enable the interoperation of the PRI-SEC system. We address a number of technical challenges pertinent to this networking environment, and evaluate the performance of MAC. Our performance evaluation results show that, in a single-hop ASN, the AS-MAC transparently utilizes 75% of the bandwidth left unused by the PRI, while, in multi-hop ASNs, due to spatial reuse, the AS-MAC can utilize significantly higher number of the idle PRI resources","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-channel MAC for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Bandwidth","GSM","Wireless communication","Cellular networks","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency","Access protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","cognitive radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","performance evaluation","resource allocation","time division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic spectrum sharing","wireless cellular communication system","bandwidth utilization","primary system","PRI","ad hoc-mesh overlay network","secondary system","SEC","nonintrusive manner","multichannel MAC protocol","medium access control","interoperability","performance evaluation","single-hop ASN","cognitive network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-channel MAC for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086736/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418923","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-channel MAC for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108162S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4086738,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37296610200"},{"name":"Alexandra Duel-Hallen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Duel-Hallen","id":"37271548400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086738","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Radio spectrum management","Decorrelation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Adaptive systems","Detectors","Frequency","Channel allocation","Matched filters","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","code division multiple access","decorrelation","error statistics","frequency hop communication","interference suppression","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier code-division multiple access system","MC-CDMA","adaptive frequency hopping","spectral efficiency","subchannel allocation algorithm","BER","bit error rate","linear decorrelating detector","receiver","MAI","multiaccess interference mitigation"]}],"abstract":"Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system with adaptive frequency hopping (FH) has attracted significant attention in the literature due to its excellent spectral efficiency.

However, the performance of the WF algorithm is degraded by the fading-induced near-far problem. We propose a new allocation algorithm to overcome the limitations of the WF algorithm, and demonstrate the resulting BER improvement using simulation. Moreover, we employ the linear decorrelating detector at the receiver of the MC-CDMA system with adaptive FH to improve the spectral efficiency.

In particular, the design of CDMA receiver algorithms for software radio is challenging because signals must be processed at rates much higher than other wireless standards. While traditional hardware implementations of the CDMA standard IS-95 despread signals received at the base station prior to Walsh decoding, in this paper we take advantage of the flexibility afforded by software implementations and develop three classes of Walsh decoding algorithms that do not require full despreading of incoming signals at the base station. Two proposed classes of algorithms exploit the fact that Walsh codes are locally decodable codes, which have the surprising property that any bit of the message can be recovered (with some probability) by examining only a small number of symbols of the codeword. We also describe a third class of algorithms based on code puncturing. All these algorithms enable trading off computation for performance, and we use them to dynamically minimize the computational requirements of the despreader and subsequent Walsh decoder such that a target bit-error rate is maintained with changing channel conditions. These algorithms are applicable to other CDMA-based systems that use Walsh codes for orthogonal modulation, and the third class is also applicable to CDMA-based systems that use codes for channelization, including lxRTT, EV-DO, and W-CDMA","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086740.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Localized Walsh Decoding For CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Multiaccess communication","Signal processing algorithms","Software radio","Software algorithms","Software standards","Base stations","Computational intelligence","Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","modulation","orthogonal codes","radio receivers","software radio","telesoftware","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software radio","wireless infrastructure","intelligent signal processing algorithm","CDMA receiver","code division multiple access","Walsh decoding algorithm","code puncturing","orthogonal modulation","lxRTT","EV-DO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Localized Walsh Decoding For CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418927","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Localized Walsh Decoding For CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071675S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086757,"authors":[{"name":"Aminata A.

We have recently designed a coded M-ary CDMA transmission scheme that can practically achieve large part of this capacity increase and improve significantly spectral efficiency of CDMA systems. The main objective of this paper is to explore the robustness of this scheme to wireless channel imperfections. We consider two potential CDMA channel impairments, i.e., imperfect power control at the transmitter and power-limited amplifiers at the receiver. Simulation results for 16-ary CDMA network transmission show that under ideal conditions, spectral efficiency of 1.45 bits per CDMA chip (i.e., more than twice the conjectured Gaussian capacity limit) is achieved. The simulation results also show that the scheme is robust to 1 dB power control error and a power limit at the receiver amplifier","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302054","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086757.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Spectrally Efficient Wireless CDMA Transmission Scheme: System Design and Robustness to Channel Imperfections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086757/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Spectrally Efficient Wireless CDMA Transmission Scheme: System Design and Robustness to Channel Imperfections","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086757/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Spectrally Efficient Wireless CDMA Transmission Scheme: System Design and Robustness to Channel Imperfections","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060767S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086773,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Zouros","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Zouros","id":"38558900300"},{"name":"Clark Robertson","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Clark","lastName":"Robertson","id":"38201255900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086773","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Binary phase shift keying","Decoding","Interference","AWGN","Additive white noise","Viterbi algorithm","Gaussian noise","Degradation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","convolutional codes","error correction codes","interference suppression","Nakagami channels","phase shift keying","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary phase-shift keyed waveform","BPSK","frequency-selective channel","fading channel","Nakagami channel","pulse-noise interference mitigation","additive white Gaussian noise","convolutional encoding","receiver","errors-erasures Viterbi decoding","performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"The performance of a system utilizing a binary phase-shift keyed waveform transmitted over a frequency-selective, slowly fading, Nakagami channel with pulse-noise interference in addition to additive white Gaussian noise is examined.

Performance can be further improved by transmitting only when channel gains are sufficiently high and by using power control to compensate for channel variations. Truncated channel inversion is an adaptive power control scheme that compensates for fading above a certain cutoff fade depth: below the cutoff level the transmission is stopped. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna selection scheme that incorporates the truncated channel inversion power control to improve the BER performance of spatial multiplexing (SM) systems with linear receivers. For systems transmitting at high data rates, further improvements are obtained by incorporating successive interference cancellation (SIC). Simulations show that, in flat Rayleigh fading channels, the proposed antenna selection scheme significantly outperforms well-known existing schemes, providing a gain of 3.75 dB and 6.25 dB over two such schemes at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302137","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086782.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection and Power Control for Limited Feedback MIMO Systems with Successive Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086782/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection and Power Control for Limited Feedback MIMO Systems with Successive Interference Cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9407516","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086782/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection and Power Control for Limited Feedback MIMO Systems with Successive Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049577S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4086784,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Chian Wong","affiliation":["DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chi Chian","lastName":"Wong","id":"38253843400"},{"name":"See Ee Tan","affiliation":["DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"firstName":"See Ee","lastName":"Tan","id":"38258338500"},{"name":"Boon Chong Ng","affiliation":["DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"firstName":"Boon Chong","lastName":"Ng","id":"38193166800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086784","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"abstract":"In this paper a direct sequence spread spectrum receiver architecture that is robust against narrowband interference (NBI) and multiple access interference (MAI) is introduced.

One relatively unexplored application involves cooperative unmanned vehicle systems called sensor swarms. We propose a conceptual unmanned vehicle swarm: a host of armed reconnaissance vehicles enabling surveillance and targeting (HARVEST). A HARVEST swarm is theoretically capable of autonomous refueling, cooperative search, information fusion, and munitions employment. To enable cooperative swarm capabilities, we identify a set of individual unmanned vehicle services, e.g., localization, querying, and routing. The HARVEST concept, swarm capabilities, and unmanned vehicle services are embodied in our sensor swarm co-simulation environment. The goal is to improve simulation fidelity by integrating existing simulators used within the department of defense (DoD). The process of integrating multiple simulations is known as co-simulation; our design uses OPNET's external system definition (ESD) to achieve co-simulation. This is the same interface OPNET provides to enable co-simulations based on the high-level architecture (HLA) defined by the defense modeling and simulation office (DMSO). The simulators in the first sensor swarm co-simulation prototype are based on the technology behind NETWARS (OPNET) and the Java programming language. To integrate with OPNET, Java wraps the ESD C-based method calls. This co-simulation is known as a Java, OPNET, and C-Based Co-Simulation (JOCosim). The implementation details of and lessons learned from the first JOCosim prototype are described in this paper. We also briefly discuss the second JOCosim prototype currently under development. The newer version places all simulation control within Java versus just receiving data from OPNET. This capability is crucial to achieving the goal of the second prototype-integrating additional simulation tools such as MATLAB, FalconView, and digital terrain elevation data (DTED)","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086787.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harvest: A Framework and Co-Simulation Environment for Analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Java","Electrostatic discharge","Virtual prototyping","Prototypes","Sensor systems and applications","Reconnaissance","Surveillance","Weapons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C language","Java","military computing","military vehicles","remotely operated vehicles","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HARVEST framework","unmanned aerial vehicle","military operation","sensor swarm","armed reconnaissance vehicle","surveillance-targeting","department of defense","DoD","external system definition","ESD","high-level architecture","HLA","defense modeling-simulation office","DMSO","Java","OPNET","C-based co-simulation","JOCosim prototype"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Harvest: A Framework and Co-Simulation Environment for Analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086787/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418957","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harvest: A Framework and Co-Simulation Environment for Analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067472S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4086800,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Torrieri","id":"37300038300"},{"name":"Eser Ustunel","affiliation":["Wichita State University Wichita, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Eser","lastName":"Ustunel","id":"37704570100"},{"name":"Hyuck M.

Therefore, DoS attacks may impact the network connectivity seriously and may further undermine the networking functions, such as control and data message delivery. In this paper, we will present a deep insight into DoS attacks and their impacts on MANETs. First, we analyze the node isolation problem resulting from DoS attacks and derive the probability of node isolation, which shows that the DoS attack exploiting fraudulent routing messages, such as BlackHole attack, impacts the connectivity much severer than other attacks. Second, we notice that the node mobility and potential attack propagation have hardly been considered in the previous DoS attack studies; therefore, we introduce a dynamic DoS attack in this paper. The dynamic DoS attack is characterized in exploiting the node mobility, dynamic power control, and compromised nodes to spread new DoS attacks dynamically. Further, we provide an analytical study on the properties of this new DoS attack, and explain its potential devastating impact on the connectivity of MANETs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086804.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302178","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Dynamic Denial of Service Attacks in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086804/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Dynamic Denial of Service Attacks in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","htmlLink":"/document/4086804/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9418959","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Dynamic Denial of Service Attacks in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050466S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086820,"authors":[{"name":"Pak Kay Tang","affiliation":["NUS Graduate School of Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pak Kay","lastName":"Tang","id":"37278366600"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Department, Institute for Infocomm Research (12R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Ling Chuen Ong","affiliation":["Radio Systems Department 12R, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ling Chuen","lastName":"Ong","id":"37278691600"},{"name":"M.K.

Secondary usage of licensed spectrum is being considered as a viable solution to the problem of inefficient usage of spectral resources. In this paper, we model and analyze the performance of the secondary system in dynamic spectrum access by secondary users employing an overlay approach of sharing spectral resources with a primary system. Our model assumes the operation of primary system is completely unaffected by the introduction of a secondary system, i.e., primary users have priority in transmission over secondary users. Each primary user is randomly assigned an available frequency slot for transmission by the primary system controller. Secondary users are required to sense across the same spectrum to identify any unoccupied frequency slots for transmission. During its transmission, if it detects a primary user accessing the same frequency slot, the connection will be forced to drop. Using a three-dimension Markov chain model, this paper presents an analytical approach to study the secondary system performance under a given primary traffic. Two important parameters that are indicative of the grade-of-service (GoS) of the secondary system, namely, secondary call blocking probability and secondary call dropping probability are computed using the model presented. The analysis provides an insightful study about how the secondary system capacity is determined by its GoS requirement. We use the same analytical approach to show that when the secondary call dropping probability is the cause of low capacity, by suitably reserving a number of frequency slots for primary users' access, the secondary system capacity can be improved significantly","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9418969","htmlLink":"/document/4086820/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Secondary Radios in Spectrum Sharing with Prioritized Primary Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Secondary Radios in Spectrum Sharing with Prioritized Primary Access","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042382S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086847,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086514078"},{"name":"Qilian Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qilian","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086847","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Radar cross section","Doppler radar","Radar detection","Diversity reception","Doppler shift","Radar scattering","Frequency estimation","Chirp modulation","Intelligent sensors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086847","abstract":"In radar sensor networks (RSN), radar members are likely to interfere with each other if their waveforms are not properly designed. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal waveform model for RSN, which eliminates interference when no doppler shift is introduced. Additionally, we design both coherent and noncoherent RSN detection systems applying equal gain combination technique performed by clusterhead to take the advantage of spatial diversity. The latter scenario is more challenging as doppler-shift uncertainty results in more complicated implementation. Also, we analyzed the performance of both systems under the environment of doppler shift and interference. Monte Carlo simulation illustrates that our technique provides much better detection performance than that of single radar for fluctuating targets, in terms of probability of false alarm and miss detection.

Recent deployment of fiber-optic backbone under DoD GIG-BE (global information grid-bandwidth extension) program is intended to meet the traffic requirements of static backbone. However, the capacity bottleneck is likely to happen at the tactical communication edge network, primarily supported today by RF communication technologies, limiting the ability to support end-to-end bandwidth-intensive war-fighting applications. In addition to enhancing the communication capacity at the tactical edge, extending high bandwidth connections from diverse end-user geographical locations to the GIG-BE through fixed and mobile optical wireless reach-back networks seems essential for realizing DoD's net-centric vision.

For all spreading codes cross-correlation considered, DBSIC has a similar AME curve shape as the conventional SIC receiver but has a higher AME which remains positive for all user energy ratios, illustrating its near-far resistance over AWGN channels. The AME of DBSIC is better than that of the decorrelating detector when the interferer is much weaker or slightly stronger than the user of interest and has worse performance when the interferer is not much weaker. It is shown that DBSIC is completely near-far resistant over Rayleigh fading channels with the same AME as the decorrelating scheme for user 1 and as the optimum scheme for user 2, both AMEs being independent of the user energy ratio.

The uniform structure of regular LDPC codes allows a practical hardware implementation which can efficiently utilize the inherent parallelism of the message passing algorithm (MPA) commonly used to decode low-density codes. The class of {3,6} LDPC codes has been extensively studied and they have been proven to provide very good error performance, especially at lower SNR. {4,8} codes have not been analyzed nearly as much in the literature, mainly because their 'threshold,' the SNR where the waterfall region of the error performance curve begins, is typically a quarter of a dB or so worse than for comparable-length {3,6} codes. It has been proposed that {4,8} codes have better high SNR behavior, but until recently it was not possible to verify this conjecture. A new technique which can efficiently find error floors of LDPC codes now has the ability to illuminate just how good {4,8} codes are in the high SNR region-a result which is of great interest for many practical applications. This paper will analyze the error floor characteristics of some {4,8} codes and provide a simple algorithm for designing {4,8} codes with low error floors. A newly-designed rate-1/2 (1200,600) {4,8} code with a vastly superior error floor compared to codes of similar parameters is introduced","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302365","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086892.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regular {4, 8} LDPC Codes and Their Lowerror Floors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Regular {4, 8} LDPC Codes and Their Lowerror Floors","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4086892/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9418799","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086892/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regular {4, 8} LDPC Codes and Their Lowerror Floors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081545S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4086895,"authors":[{"name":"Ilkay Sari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, 214 Zachry Engineering Center, College Station, TX77843-3128, phone: +(1)979-458-2287, fax: +(1)979-862-4630. email: ilkay@ece.tamu.edu"],"firstName":"Ilkay","lastName":"Sari","id":"38094027800"},{"name":"Erchin Serpedin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, USA"],"firstName":"Erchin","lastName":"Serpedin","id":"37281308600"},{"name":"Bruce Suter","affiliation":["Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, USA","AirForce Research Laboratory/IFGC, Rome"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Suter","id":"37282003500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086895","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086895","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Synchronization","Wireless sensor networks","Delay estimation","Uncertainty","Computer networks","Broadcasting","Power engineering and energy","Wireless application protocol","Delay effects"]}],"abstract":"Starting from a well-known fact that long-lived time-synchronization is very important for efficient use of energy in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and is possible by not only estimating clock phase offsets but also clock skews and drifts, we proposed the Gibbs Sampler as a joint-estimator under exponential noise model for reference broadcast synchronization (RBS) protocol.

Requiring simple channel state information (CSI) of both the source-relay and the relay-destination links, LAR has been shown to achieve full diversity using coherent modulations. In this paper, we generalize the idea of LAR into differential and non-coherent cooperative transmissions, which do not require CSI at either relays or destination. We prove that full spatial diversity gain can still be achieved in such systems, without incurring the overhead of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme is universally applicable to multi-branch and multi-hop cooperation regardless of the constellation size and outperforms existing alternatives.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043248","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4086332/4043248/04086897.pdf","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications Without Channel State Information","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302370","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications Without Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4086897/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4086897/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications Without Channel State Information","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"MILCOM-00-565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055245S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4086332","isNumber":"4043248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4086332","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4043248","articleId":"4086897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4086898,"authors":[{"name":"Shruti Sethi","affiliation":["TR Laboratories (Telecommunications Research Laboratories), Calgary, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Shruti","lastName":"Sethi","id":"38114650700"},{"name":"Reza Pasand","affiliation":["TR Laboratories (Telecommunications Research Laboratories), Calgary, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Pasand","id":"37273139600"},{"name":"John Nielsen","affiliation":["TR Laboratories (Telecommunications Research Laboratories), Calgary, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"37280839600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0617-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0618-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"4086898","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4086898","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Ultra wideband communication","Pulse modulation","Kalman filters","Bit error rate","Ultra wideband technology","Radio communication","Attenuation","Propagation delay","RAKE receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","Kalman filters","pulse position modulation","time-varying channels","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Kalman filter","ultra-wideband impulse radio communication","UWB communication system","time varying channel","signal echoes","time hopping","pulse position modulation","PPM","bit error rate","BER","Rake receiver"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the estimation of time varying channels for ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio communication.

The computation used mobile radio parameters and provided the maximum theoretical MIMO capacity gain. Receiver positions were moved relative to a fixed transmitter within the urban area and MIMO performance was evaluated as a function of receiver position. A 2times2 MIMO system was used for simplicity and three propagation related parameters were varied to assess the behavior and capability of this method: MIMO antenna spacing, ground and building electric properties. Spatial averaging of the ray tracing solutions was required to obtain consistent results. The averaging was necessary due to the narrow bandwidth solutions associated with this technique, where results were sensitive to small changes in relative transmitter/receiver positions and computational parameters. Upon appropriate averaging, the ray tracing solutions yielded MIMO capacities that depended on antenna spacing and surface electrical properties in a consistent manner. For example, MIMO gains improved with increased antenna separation. Behavior such as key-holing, where RF energy propagates in an urban corridor, was observed.

This paper defines a new problem for scheduling real-time traffic in time division multicode CDMA networks, which optimizes the PER and PDR jointly across the physical and link layers.

A novel cross-layer enhanced real-time packet scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimize the PLR experienced by each user in each frame, and distribute it fairly between users over the long term.

Ageing of the cable insulation is becoming an increasing problem that requires development of reliable methods for on-line condition assessment. For insulation condition assessment of MV and HV cables, partial discharge (PD) monitoring is one of the most effective techniques. However on-site and on-line PD measurements are affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) that makes sensitive PD detection very difficult, if not impossible. This paper describes implementation of wavelet transform techniques to reject noise from on-line partial discharge measurements on cables. A new wavelet threshold determination method is proposed with the technique. With implementation of this novel de-noising method, PD measurement sensitivity has been greatly improved. In addition, a full AC cycle data recovery can be achieved instead of focusing only on recovering individual PD pulses. Other wavelet threshold de-noising methods are discussed and examined under a noisy environment to compare their performance with the new method proposed here. The method described here has been found to be superior to the other wavelet-based methods","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel wavelet transform technique for on-line partial discharge measurements. 1.

Insulation assessment of HV cables requires continuous partial discharge (PD) monitoring to identify the nature of insulation defects and to determine any degradation trends.

This paper is the second of two papers addressing this challenge for on-line PD measurements in a noisy environment. The first paper described a wavelet transform-based method of interference rejection. This paper applies that method to the problem of on-site testing, using both laboratory tests and on-site tests. The laboratory tests were used to stimulate the noisy on-site testing environment, with use of transient pulse-like noise, discrete spectral interference (DSI) and white noise. These noise types have been successfully rejected by the method proposed in the first paper. In addition, on-site tests have been undertaken and have been able to detect PD signals in an old 11 kV substation multi-cable installation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4088901/04088906.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2007.302865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2007.302865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4088901","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4088906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel wavelet transform technique for on-line partial discharge measurements. 2.

As described in this paper, the first step in a series of study for the purpose above was taken by analyzing lightning surge waveforms and restriking surge waveforms such as disconnector switching surge waveforms at UHV, 500 kV, and 275 kV substations and identifying four typical non-standard lightning impulse waveforms with basic frequencies of 0.24 to 1.0 MHz. Then, two of these non-standard lightning impulse waveforms, the single-pulse waveform which is the most basic type and the waveform with a pulse in the crest and a subsequent flat section, were used to measure the breakdown voltage and the partial discharge inception voltage while changing the parameters, on three models that represent the insulation elements of windings of oil-immersed transformers. Then, the resultant average breakdown voltages were evaluated in terms of the overvoltage durations, leading to a result of formulating them in a unified way. In the tested range, the dielectric breakdown values under non-standard lightning impulse waveforms were higher, marking 52% at the maximum, than those under standard lightning impulse waveforms in all the cases, suggesting a possibility of lowering the insulation specifications of an oil-immersed transformer","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4088901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2007.302883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4088901/04088922.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"155","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2007.302883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of breakdown characteristics of oil-immersed transformers under non-standard lightning impulse waveforms - definition of non-standard lightning impulse waveforms and insulation characteristics for waveforms including pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of breakdown characteristics of oil-immersed transformers under non-standard lightning impulse waveforms - definition of non-standard lightning impulse waveforms and insulation characteristics for waveforms including pulses","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4088922/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9298539","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4088922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of breakdown characteristics of oil-immersed transformers under non-standard lightning impulse waveforms - definition of non-standard lightning impulse waveforms and insulation characteristics for waveforms including pulses","sourcePdf":"p146-okabe.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120136S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4088901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4088901","articleId":"4088922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4088939,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Through the base station placement, not only the best quality of service of the network is guaranteed, but also the performance of the network can be a tradeoff with the number of allowable base stations. This provides a greater flexibility for the designer when the factory environment such as physical space, building structure, equipment, and cost are the significant parts of the overall design criteria. The main feature of this optimization scheme is its capacity to yield the extreme minmax solutions under a specific allowable design, power-loss threshold. It provides a much wider range of solutions for selection, which includes the ultimate low-cost design without sacrificing the performance or vice versa.

The control strategy is based on the nonlinear backstepping approach. Emphasis is essentially on the tuning parameters effect and on how it influences the dynamic behavior of the errors. While the backstepping control ensures the global asymptotic stability of the system, the tuning parameters of the controller, nonetheless, do greatly affect the saturation and chattering in the control signal, and consequently, the dynamic errors. In fact, electrohydraulic systems are known to be highly nonlinear and non-differentiable due to many factors, such as leakage, friction, and especially, the fluid flow expression through the servo valve. These nonlinear terms appear in the closed loop dynamic errors. Their values are so large that in the presence of a poor design, they can easily overwhelm the effect of the controller parameters. Backstepping is used here because it is a powerful and robust nonlinear strategy. The experimental results are compared to those obtained with a real-time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, to prove that classic linear controllers fail to achieve a good tracking of the desired output, especially, when the hydraulic actuator operates at the maximum load. Before going through the controller design, the system parameters are identified. Despite the nonlinearity of the system, identification is based on the recursive least squares method. This is done by rewriting the mathematical model of the system in a linear in parameters (LP) form. Finally, the experimental results will show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of guaranteed stability and zero tracking error","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/4088960/04088969.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2006.886190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2006.886190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4088960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4088969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and Real-Time Control of an Electrohydraulic Servo System Based on Nonlinear Backstepping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Electrohydraulics","Servomechanisms","Backstepping","Fluid flow control","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Fluid dynamics","Pi control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","electrohydraulic control equipment","least mean squares methods","nonlinear control systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time control","electrohydraulic servo systems","nonlinear backstepping approach","tuning parameters effect","global asymptotic stability","closed loop dynamic errors","robust nonlinear strategy","PID control","real-time proportional-integral-derivative control","controller design","recursive least squares method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping","electrohydraulic systems","nonlinear control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4088969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Identification and Real-Time Control of an Electrohydraulic Servo System Based on Nonlinear Backstepping","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4088969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9367886","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and Real-Time Control of an Electrohydraulic Servo System Based on Nonlinear Backstepping","sourcePdf":"12tmech01-kaddissi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080769S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"4088960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"4088960","articleId":"4088969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4088977,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Romero Aguero","affiliation":["Instituto de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Oeste, San Juan, Argentina"],"bio":{"p":["Julio Romero Ag\u00fcero (S'00\u2013M'05\u2013SM'06) received the electrical engineer degree from Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Honduras (UNAH), Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering (with honors) from Instituto de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Argentina, in 2005.","He was part of Empresa Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica (ENEE), Honduras, from 1995 to 2000.

Uncertain information can create imperfect expressions for pattern sets in various pattern recognition algorithms. Therefore, various types of uncertainty may be taken into account when performing several pattern recognition methods. When one performs clustering with fuzzy sets, fuzzy membership values express assignment availability of patterns for clusters. However, when one assigns fuzzy memberships to a pattern set, imperfect information for a pattern set involves uncertainty which exist in the various parameters that are used in fuzzy membership assignment. When one encounters fuzzy clustering, fuzzy membership design includes various uncertainties (e.g., distance measure, fuzzifier, prototypes, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty associated with the fuzzifier parameter m that controls the amount of fuzziness of the final C-partition in the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. To design and manage uncertainty for fuzzifier m, we extend a pattern set to interval type-2 fuzzy sets using two fuzzifiers m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1 </sub>\n and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n which creates a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) for the fuzzifier m. Then, we incorporate this interval type-2 fuzzy set into FCM to observe the effect of managing uncertainty from the two fuzzifiers. We also provide some solutions to type-reduction and defuzzification (i.e., cluster center updating and hard-partitioning) in FCM. Several experimental results are given to show the validity of our method","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4088976/04088987.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4088976","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4088987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertain Fuzzy Clustering: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Approach to --Means","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Pattern recognition","Computational complexity","Employment","Computer science","Clustering algorithms","Availability","Measurement uncertainty","Prototypes","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","fuzzy systems","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain fuzzy clustering","pattern recognition","type 2 fuzzy sets","fuzzy membership assignment","fuzzy C-means algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy $C$ -means (FCM)","fuzzy clustering","interval type-2 fuzzy sets","type-2 fuzzy sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4088987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Uncertain Fuzzy Clustering: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Approach to <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$C$</tex></formula>-Means","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4088987/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9319016","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertain Fuzzy Clustering: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Approach to <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$C$</tex></formula>-Means","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz01-hwang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121301S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4088976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"300","xplore-issue":"4088976","articleId":"4088987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4088991,"authors":[{"name":"Ozge Uncu","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada","School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4088976/4088991/4088991-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d6zge Uncu (M'99) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical-electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1995, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in industrial engineering from University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada in 1998 and 2003, respectively.","He worked as a Research Assistant and Instructor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto.

Conventional FSM techniques utilize type 1 fuzzy sets in order to capture the uncertainty in the system. However, since type 1 fuzzy sets express the belongingness of a crisp value <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$x^{\\prime}$</tex> </formula> of a base variable <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$x$</tex> </formula> in a fuzzy set <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$A$</tex></formula> by a crisp membership value <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu_{A} (x^{\\prime})$</tex> </formula>, they cannot fully capture the uncertainties due to imprecision in identifying membership functions. Higher types of fuzzy sets can be a remedy to address this issue. Since, the computational complexity of operations on fuzzy sets are increasing with the increasing type of the fuzzy set, the use of type 2 fuzzy sets and linguistic logical connectives drew a considerable amount of attention in the realm of fuzzy system modeling in the last two decades. In this paper, we propose a black-box methodology that can identify robust type 2 Takagi\u2013Sugeno, Mizumoto and Linguistic fuzzy system models with high predictive power. One of the essential problems of type 2 fuzzy system models is computational complexity. In order to remedy this problem, discrete interval valued type 2 fuzzy system models are proposed with type reduction. In the proposed fuzzy system modeling methods, fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is used in order to identify the system structure. The proposed discrete interval valued type 2 fuzzy system models are generated by a learning parameter of FCM, known as the level of membership, and its variation over a specific set of values which generate the uncertainty associated with the system structure. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4088991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4088991/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9319015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Interval Type 2 Fuzzy System Models Using Uncertainty in Learning Parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Interval Type 2 Fuzzy System Models Using Uncertainty in Learning Parameters","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz01-uncu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094181S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4088976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4088976","articleId":"4088991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":4089043,"authors":[{"name":"Shahriar Negahdaripour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4089029/4089043/4089043-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahriar Negahdaripour (S'86\u2013M'86\u2013SM'95) received the S.B., S.M., and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 1979, 1980, and 1987, respectively.","He joined the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, in January 1987 as an Assistant Professor. in August 1991, he joined the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Additionally, there is a critical need to provide protection against sabotage activities, and to establish effective countermeasures against illegal smuggling activities. Unmanned underwater vehicles are suitable platforms for the development of automated inspection systems, but require integration with appropriate sensor technologies. This paper describes a vision system for automated ship-hull inspection, based on computing the necessary information for positioning, navigation, and mapping of the hull from stereo images. Binocular cues are critical in resolving a number of complex visual artifacts that hamper monocular vision in shallow-water conditions.

Two receivers that utilize multichannel (array) processing of asynchronous multiuser signals are proposed: the symbol decision feedback (SDF) receiver and the chip hypothesis feedback (CHF) receiver. Both receivers use a chip-resolution adaptive front end consisting of a many-to-few combiner and a bank of fractionally-spaced feedforward equalizers. In the SDF receiver, feedback equalization is implemented at symbol resolution, and receiver filters, including a decision-directed phase-locked loop, are adapted at the symbol rate. This limits its applicability to the channels whose time variation is slow compared to the symbol rate. In a wideband acoustic system, which transmits at maximal chip rate, the symbol rate is down-scaled by the spreading factor, and an inverse effect may occur by which increasing the spreading factor results in performance degradation. To eliminate this effect, feedback equalization, which is necessary for the majority of acoustic channels, is performed in the CHF receiver at chip resolution and receiver parameters are adjusted at the chip rate. At the price of increased computational complexity (there are as many adaptive filters as there are symbol values), this receiver provides improved performance for systems where time variation cannot be neglected with respect to the symbol rate [e.g., low probability of detection (LPD) acoustic systems]. Performance of the two receivers was demonstrated in a four-user scenario, using experimental data obtained over a 2-km shallow-water channel. At the chip rate of 19.2 kilochips per second (kc/s) with quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, excellent results were achieved at an aggregate data rate of up to 10 kb/s","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2006.880389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/4089029/04089047.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2006.880389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4089029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Detection for Wideband Underwater Acoustic CDMA Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4089047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Detection for Wideband Underwater Acoustic CDMA Communications","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4089047/","accessionNumber":"9314001","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Detection for Wideband Underwater Acoustic CDMA Communications","sourcePdf":"31joe03-stojanovic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097381S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"4089029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4089029","articleId":"4089047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4089052,"authors":[{"name":"Vronique Cochin","affiliation":["Groupe des Ecoles de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (GET), Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9I\u00e9communications, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4089050/4089052/4089052-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["V\u00e9ronique Cochin (M'03) was born in 1972.

In order to excite the AR without extinguishing the electric arc, the lamps were supplied by means of a dc current with a superposed variable-frequency ac signal. By using this methodology, theoretical and experimental resonances were compared in terms of frequency, amplitude, and threshold-power level for their excitation. The experiments were carried out on four 35-W samples from each manufacturer (Osram and Philips), each of them with burning times of 100, 2500, and 5000 h, in order to cope with the full life of this type of lamps. AR maps for each lamp were obtained. These maps show not only the frequencies at which AR appear but also the amplitude of the resonances. The obtained AR maps are intended to be used by designers in order to know if a particular instantaneous lamp power waveform would be suitable to supply the lamp without generating AR. An application example on how to use these maps is also presented. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4089081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2006.889272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4089081/04089090.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"58","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2006.889272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic-Resonance Characterization of Low-Wattage Metal\u2013Halide Lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic-Resonance Characterization of Low-Wattage Metal\u2013Halide Lamps","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4089090/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9313978","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4089090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic-Resonance Characterization of Low-Wattage Metal\u2013Halide Lamps","sourcePdf":"35tps01-dallacosta.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078329S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4089081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4089081","articleId":"4089090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4089107,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Adnan Al-Alaoui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4089106/4089107/4089107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamad Adnan Al-Alaoui (S'70\u2013M'83\u2013SM'91) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, in 1963, the B.S.E.E. degree from Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, in 1965, and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, in 1968 and 1974, respectively.","He served as an Assistant Project Engineer with the Avionics Department, Bendix Radio Division, Baltimore, MD, from 1966 to 1967.

The IF under study consists of digital filters with fixed coefficients, except for a limited number of multipliers required in the Farrow-based sampling rate converter (SRC). The fixed-coefficient filters can be implemented efficiently using sum-of-power-of-two (SOPOT) coefficients and the multiplier-block technique, which gives minimum adder realization. Apart from the multipliers required in the SRC, the digital IF can be implemented without any multiplications. While most multiplier- less filter design and realization methods address only the coefficient round-off problem by minimizing the number of SOPOT terms used, the proposed design methodology aims to minimize more realistic hardware complexity measure, such as adder cells and registers, of the digital IF subject to a given spectral and accuracy specifications. The motivation is that the complexity is closely related to the target output accuracy, which is specified statistically by its total output noise power generated by rounding the intermediate data. Two novel algorithms for optimizing the internal wordlengths of linear time-invariant systems are proposed. The first one relaxes the solution to real valued and formulates the design problem as a constrained optimization. A closed-form solution can be determined by the Lagrange multiplier method.

Because of separation of signal and noise subspaces, the more complicated subspace-based LMMSE detector has better performance than the CMOE detector. The recursive subspace tracking algorithms are also investigated for the subspace-based MMSE receiver. Numerical results show that the steady-state performance of the robust CMOE detector is close to the subspace-based MMSE method.

Constant-frequency, pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switching converters, for instance, have poor light-load efficiencies because of higher switching losses while pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) control in discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) is more efficient at light loads because the switching frequency and associated switching losses are scaled down with load current. This paper presents the design and integrated circuit prototype results of an 83% power efficient 0.5-V 50-mA CMOS PFM buck (step-down) dc-dc converter with a novel adaptive on-time scheme that generates a 27-mV output ripple voltage from a 1.4- to 4.2-V input supply (battery-compatible range). The output ripple voltage variation and steady-state accuracy of the proposed supply was 5 mV (22-27 mV) and 0.6% whereas its constant on-time counterpart was 45 mV (10-55 mV) and 3.6%, respectively. The proposed control scheme provides an accurate power supply while achieving 2%-10% higher power efficiency than conventional fixed on-time schemes with little circuit complexity added, which is critical during light-loading conditions, where quiescent current plays a pivotal role in determining efficiency and battery-life performance","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.887472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4089106/04089130.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4089106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.887472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Accurate, Low-Voltage, CMOS Switching Power Supply With Adaptive On-Time Pulse-Frequency Modulation (PFM) Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4089130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"An Accurate, Low-Voltage, CMOS Switching Power Supply With Adaptive On-Time Pulse-Frequency Modulation (PFM) Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4089130/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9306060","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4089130/","volume":"54","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Accurate, Low-Voltage, CMOS Switching Power Supply With Adaptive On-Time Pulse-Frequency Modulation (PFM) Control","sourcePdf":"54tcsi02-sahu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0585S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4089106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"4089106","articleId":"4089130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4089132,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Tandon","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Tandon","id":"37276570100"},{"name":"M.

Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) provide an attractive solution for high precision tracking of minimum ionizing particles. In these devices, a thin, moderately doped, undepleted silicon layer is used as the active detector volume with the readout electronics implemented on top of it. Recently, a new MAPS prototype was fabricated using the AMS 0.35 mum OPTO process, featuring a thick epitaxial layer. A systematic study of tracking performance of that prototype using high-energy particle beam is presented in this work. Noise performance, signal amplitude from minimum ionizing particles, detection efficiency, spurious hit suppression and spatial resolution are shown as a function of the readout pitch and the charge collecting diode size. A test array with a novel readout circuitry was also fabricated and tested. Each pixel circuit consists of a front-end voltage amplifier, capacitively coupled to the charge collecting diode, followed by two analog memory cells. This architecture implements an on-pixel correlated double sampling method, allowing for optimization of integration independently of full frame readout time and strongly reduces the pixel-to-pixel output signal dispersion.

Therefore, hardened circuits are currently demanded in many applications where fault tolerance was not a concern in the very near past. To this purpose, efficient hardness evaluation solutions are required to deal with the increasing size and complexity of modern VLSI circuits. In this paper, a very fast and cost effective solution for SEU sensitivity evaluation is presented. The proposed approach uses FPGA emulation in an autonomous manner to fully exploit the FPGA emulation speed. Three different techniques to implement it are proposed and analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed Autonomous Emulation approach can reach execution rates higher than one million faults per second, providing a performance improvement of two orders of magnitude with respect to previous approaches. These rates give way to consider very large fault injection campaigns that were not possible in the past","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.889115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.889115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4089136/04089170.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4089136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4089170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Fault Emulation: A New FPGA-Based Acceleration System for Hardness Evaluation","volume":"54","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9313730","htmlLink":"/document/4089170/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Fault Emulation: A New FPGA-Based Acceleration System for Hardness Evaluation","sourcePdf":"54tns01-lopezongil-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086715S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4089136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4089136","articleId":"4089170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4089189,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Our experiments show that a sampled pattern matching (SPM) predictor achieves 77% to 96% of the prediction hit rates when we use the dimension-order routing algorithm.
