British Aerospace (Dynamics) Limited have responsibility for EMC in all company products. Computational electromagnetic (CEM) techniques can be applied to both assessment of problems arising in existing systems, and to good initial EMC design of products. The CEM techniques that can be applied to the problem may be broadly classified on the basis of the method by which they are derived from Maxwell's equations. Methods based on integral equations often using the method of moments are ideal for solving radiated field problems, particularly for conductors. They can be used to compute the incident field strength at the target equipment, and currents flowing on the outer surface. For problems of field ingress to structures, especially if the interior geometry is complex, differential methods are more suitable. Techniques such as finite difference and finite element methods can be employed. Both have different advantages and drawbacks. The application of the finite element (FE) method for modelling field ingress to a simple structure at VHF and UHF frequencies is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/1202/3778/00140103.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"1991 International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of finite element methods to the modelling of field ingress to structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic compatibility","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical engineering computing","electromagnetic compatibility","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM wave ingress","computational electromagnetics","finite element methods","modelling","field ingress","structures","electromagnetic compatibility","EMC","British Aerospace","Maxwell's equations","integral equations","method of moments","radiated field problems","conductors","incident field strength","target equipment","currents","differential methods","VHF","UHF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Application of finite element methods to the modelling of field ingress to structures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117650","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-25 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of finite element methods to the modelling of field ingress to structures","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00140103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07096S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov 1991","isNumber":"3778","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1202","citationCount":"2","articleId":"140103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":140198,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

This goal can be reached by a receiver architecture which lends itself to VLSI and which does not require any adjustments during the production process. The authors have studied a number of direct-conversion receiver structures. A receiver based on the incoherent direct conversion principle with differential data detection was investigated candidate system for TDMA mobile communications. A typical application would be the proposed Digital European Cordless Telecommunication (DECT) system where a data rate of more than 1 Mbit/s is envisaged. The author describes the architecture of the receiver and key components, e.g. the synchronization unit and the algorithm of the fast gain control unit. Both are needed for operation in a TDMA system. Solutions to overcome the blocking problems of a direct conversion architecture are presented. The receiver performance is characterized by error rates in the presence of noise, of adjacent-channel signal and of co-channel signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Cordless telephone systems","Error analysis","Radio receivers","Time division multiaccess"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cordless telephone systems","error statistics","radio receivers","radiotelephony","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost direct conversion receiver structures","cochannel signals","TDMA mobile communications","public land mobile telecommunication systems","mobile terminals","VLSI","Digital European Cordless Telecommunication","DECT","synchronization unit","fast gain control unit","performance","error rates","noise","adjacent-channel signal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140229","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 Sixth International Conference on Mobile Radio and Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1201/3779/00140229.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3779","publicationTitle":"1991 Sixth International Conference on Mobile Radio and Personal Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-cost direct conversion receiver structures for TDMA mobile communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Low-cost direct conversion receiver structures for TDMA mobile communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec 1991","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117732","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-cost direct conversion receiver structures for TDMA mobile communications","confLoc":"Coventry, UK","sourcePdf":"00140229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03965S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec 1991","isNumber":"3779","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1201","citationCount":"4","articleId":"140229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":140230,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

The reemergence of interest in neural networks in recent years has caught the attention of those involved in fingerprint recognition as they begin to recognise the potential advantages of a neural network approach.

Two approaches are considered. First, Zernike moment expansions are used to produce invariant representations of the image.

Methods of reducing the dimensionality of the ensuing image representations are discussed, and the performances of both coding methods are assessed and compared.

The smallest margin to the requirement is consequently found for the flat fading, or nearly flat fading, case. The TIA requirements also contain performance criteria for the output data from the channel decoder. The simulation environment described was used for determining these requirements.

The basic idea lies in applying the in-service delay time detection method proposed previously for a BPSK (binary phase-shift keying) signal to a pi /2-shift BPSK signal which is converted from a pi /4-shift QPSK signal by passing a frequency-doubler circuit. Then, by measuring both in-phase and quadrature channel outputs, a bit stream corresponding to the doubled phase shifts is obtained from one channel output and multipath delay time information is obtained from the other channel output. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer simulation has been performed assuming few-ray multipath models, and a fairly good result was obtained. However, it was also shown that this method is sensitive to bandwidth restriction to some extent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140434","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple multipath delay time detection method for pi /4 shift QPSK in digital mobile/portable communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple multipath delay time detection method for pi /4 shift QPSK in digital mobile/portable communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140434/","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4111782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple multipath delay time detection method for pi /4 shift QPSK in digital mobile/portable communications","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044832S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"1","articleId":"140434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":140435,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In order to substantiate the results presented, novel power control and handoff protocols are also proposed in light of the assumptions made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of direct sequence CDMA for future mobile communication networks","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140446","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140446.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of direct sequence CDMA for future mobile communication networks","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4111792","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of direct sequence CDMA for future mobile communication networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048205S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"11","articleId":"140446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140447,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The effects of a barrage jammer, Rayleigh fading, and log-normal shadowing on the system performance are discussed. Probability of error expressions for a hybrid BDPSK (binary differential phase shift keying) SS are derived in terms of the channel parameters. The results are compared to those obtained for the same system without fading and shadowing. For a given probability of error, the performance is worse for the case of Rayleigh fading compared to the case of additive white Gaussian noise only. Severe performance degradation is also observed, primarily as a result of fading in a mobile radio channel. Consequently, in order to achieve a high performance level, diversity should be used to reduce the effect of shadowing and fast fading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140456/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4111801","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a hybrid spread spectrum system in a hostile land mobile radio channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a hybrid spread spectrum system in a hostile land mobile radio channel","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034917S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"2","articleId":"140456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":140461,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The proposed approach makes use of an antenna array in conjunction with an adaptive combiner that employs a training sequence to adjust the receiver to the desired co-user. A different training sequence known to the receiver is transmitted periodically with the information sequence of each co-user. Signals received at the diversity antennas are weighted and summed to produce a combined signal. The weight coefficients are adjusted such that the reception of the desired signal is enhanced and all interfering signals are attenuated. A complex least-mean-square algorithm based on the method of steepest descent is used for weight adjustment. Computer simulations are presented for a two-antenna system with coherent QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keying) signaling over frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channels, and in the presence of a single interferer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140482.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive combiner for co-channel interference reduction in multi-user indoor radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Adaptive arrays","Receiving antennas","Receivers","Indoor radio communication","Antenna arrays","Computer simulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Phase shift keying","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","digital radio systems","diversity reception","fading","interference suppression","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steepest descent method","adaptive combiner","co-channel interference reduction","multi-user indoor radio systems","interference suppression","radio communication systems","antenna array","training sequence","diversity antennas","weight coefficients","complex least-mean-square algorithm","coherent QPSK","quadrature phase-shift keying","frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive combiner for co-channel interference reduction in multi-user indoor radio systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117126","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive combiner for co-channel interference reduction in multi-user indoor radio systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037513S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"22","articleId":"140482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140483,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

The required attenuation level for LO (local-oscillator) leakage for the assumed system terminal is calculated. Furthermore, from test receiver measurements, it was found that LO circuit shielding is necessary for practical system applications. The required out-of-band attenuation level of an RF filter for interference signals was also investigated quantitatively from experimental data obtained from bit-error-rate measurements in an actual radio wave environment and from calculations based on a 1 dB gain compression point of the mixer. Thus, it has been found that an interference rejection filter is necessary for practical direct conversion receiver applications. However, the filter specification is largely relaxed compared with the image rejection filter in a conventional superheterodyne architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140530.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"462","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design study on a direct conversion receiver front-end for 280 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.6 GHz band radio communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Radio frequency","Circuit testing","Receivers","System testing","Radiofrequency interference","RF signals","Attenuation measurement","Gain measurement","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","radio receivers","radiofrequency amplifiers","radiofrequency filters","radiofrequency oscillators","shielding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local oscillator leakage attenuation","VHF","mixer gain compression point","UHF","direct conversion receiver front-end","radio communication","RF stage performance","LO circuit shielding","out-of-band attenuation level","RF filter","bit-error-rate measurements","interference rejection filter","280 MHz","900 MHz","2.6 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Design study on a direct conversion receiver front-end for 280 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.6 GHz band radio communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design study on a direct conversion receiver front-end for 280 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.6 GHz band radio communication systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046988S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"22","articleId":"140530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":140544,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Three performance measures are defined: the probability of lost calls, the probability of unnecessary handover, and the probability of handover. In the design of a handover algorithm, a tradeoff between these measures has to be made since they cannot be minimized simultaneously. A particular class of algorithms, linear handover algorithms, is introduced. Performance bounds are derived, and expressions for the performance measures for linear algorithms are given. In particular, a lower bound for the probability of lost calls is derived.

An analysis and quantitative assessment of the losses due to analog implementations are presented. They include spurious tones and intermodulation products at the transmitter and a degraded BER (bit error rate) due to distortion of the signal constellation. The asymptotic degradation in BER performance in 16 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) for example is shown to be 1.1 dB for a 5 degrees phase imbalance and 0.65 dB for 5% gain imbalance. An adaptive procedure at the receiver for minimization of the imbalance and offset errors is developed. It is demonstrated that the LMS (least mean square) algorithm can be used to adapt the compensator in a manner similar to an equalizer, and that the computational load is the same as that of a three-tap equalizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140557.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive compensation for imbalance and offset losses in direct conversion transceivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Degradation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Equalizers","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation","Digital modulation","Demodulation","Transceivers","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","analogue circuits","demodulators","digital radio systems","mobile radio systems","modulators","signal processing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive imbalance minimisation","amplitude imbalances","LMS algorithm","analog modulators","analog demodulators","mobile radio","signal processing","direct conversion transceivers","phase imbalances","DC offset","digital transceivers","analog implementations","spurious tones","intermodulation products","degraded BER","bit error rate","asymptotic degradation","16 QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","gain imbalance","offset errors","computational load"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive compensation for imbalance and offset losses in direct conversion transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117188","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive compensation for imbalance and offset losses in direct conversion transceivers","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04878S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"8","articleId":"140557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":140560,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The results are presented both in the form of impulse responses and in a statistical manner along the chosen routes. It is found that reflections may give rise to two types of problems: they can cause considerable time spreads in a cell and significant signal levels in areas that are normally regarded as belonging to other cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140561.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specular reflections from high-rise buildings in 900 MHz cellular systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Area measurement","Acoustic reflection","Time division multiple access","Dispersion","Wavelength measurement","Surface waves","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","electromagnetic wave reflection","field strength measurement","radiowave propagation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","building groups","UHF","wideband radiowave propagation measurements","Dallas","specular reflections","high-rise buildings","RCS 900 channel sounder","isolated buildings","impulse responses","time spreads","900 MHz","908 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Specular reflections from high-rise buildings in 900 MHz cellular systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117191","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specular reflections from high-rise buildings in 900 MHz cellular systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081672S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"23","articleId":"140561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140565,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

ACT-Demod LSI achieves a transmission performance better than that of conventional noncoherent differential detection while consuming less than 9 mW of power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140574.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel QPSK demodulation LSI (ACT-Demod) for digital mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Demodulation","Large scale integration","Land mobile radio","Circuits","Automatic frequency control","Phase shift keying","Time division multiple access","Mobile communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","CMOS integrated circuits","demodulators","digital radio systems","mobile radio systems","phase shift keying","time division multiple access","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS IC","QPSK demodulation LSI","digital mobile radio","pi /4-shifted QPSK","quadrature phase-shift keying","adaptive carrier tracking","TDMA","time-division multiple-access","fast carrier tracking","bit-error-rate","fast Rayleigh fading","ACT demodulation","digital circuits","branch QPSK detectors","postdetection selection diversity","bit timing recovery circuit","AFC","automatic frequency control","ACT-Demod LSI","transmission performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"A novel QPSK demodulation LSI (ACT-Demod) for digital mobile radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117202","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel QPSK demodulation LSI (ACT-Demod) for digital mobile radio","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045267S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"13","articleId":"140574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":140576,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The adaptive data transmission concept can potentially increase transmission throughput on a practical data network considerably, provided that a suitable protocol can be established for handling the adaptation process. Reverse modulation, a means for obtaining channel fading information from a data signal without recourse to a separate reference transmission, is shown to be highly effective for a specific DPSK (differential phase shift keying) example. Its performance is slightly inferior to that of a reference-based approach but with greatly reduced transmitter complexity and without the requirement for reference location, which is a nonnegligible overhead in reference tone or reference symbol insertion techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140591.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"734","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140591","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140591","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140591","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Data communication","Proposals","Modulation coding","Error analysis","Modems","Throughput","Protocols","Phase modulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","mobile radio systems","parameter estimation","phase shift keying","signal processing","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback channel estimation","coding optimisation","mobile radio","signal processing","adaptive data transmission management","modulation format","channel conditions","reverse modulation channel sounding","irreducible error rate floor","channel fading information","DPSK","differential phase shift keying","reduced transmitter complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140591/","displayDocTitle":"Decision feedback channel estimation-a precursor for adaptive data transmission management","accessionNumber":"4120578","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision feedback channel estimation-a precursor for adaptive data transmission management","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031211S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"2","articleId":"140591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140593,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This technique does not provide real-time adaptation but only adjusts to the drifting characteristics of the power amplifier. This technique is based on the ability to sample the out-of-band power and use this scalar quantity to adjust the predistorter coefficients. The predistorter could be implemented in analog form or digitally. Analog predistorters can take the form of cubic predistorters consisting of antiparallel diodes with gain and phase adjustments, intermediate frequency analog polynomials, etc. Digital predistorters using this technique can consist of adjustments to the vector lookup table entries. It is demonstrated that this method requires only a simple adaptation strategy because of the quadratic shape of the surface contour.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140596.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new technique for adaptation of linearizing predistorters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Polynomials","Predistortion","Demodulation","Power generation","Linearization techniques","Output feedback","Delay","Phase shifters","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","linearisation techniques","modulators","power amplifiers","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog predistorter adaptation","digital predistorter","power amplifier drift characteristics","modulation","signal processing","linearizing predistorters","out-of-band power","cubic predistorters","antiparallel diodes","intermediate frequency analog polynomials","vector lookup table","quadratic shape","surface contour"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"A new technique for adaptation of linearizing predistorters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4120582","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new technique for adaptation of linearizing predistorters","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043872S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"21","articleId":"140596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":140597,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is demonstrated that with simple electronics one can improve the performance of a noncoherently detected pi /4-QPSK signal in both AWGN and fast Rician fading. When the K-factor (defined as the ratio of the average power of the multipath signal to direct path power) of the Rician channel decreases, the improvement increases. An improvement of 1.2 dB could be obtained at a BER of 10/sup -4/ in an AWGN channel.

Cochannel interference probability is derived, considering UHF ground-wave path loss, Rayleigh fading, and thermal noise. To reduce the cochannel interference probability, two types of diversity technique are considered: selection diversity and equal gain combining. Spectrum efficiency is also evaluated in terms of cochannel interference probability, cluster size (i.e., reuse distance), protection ratio, and blocking probability. Although the implementation of equal gain combining is much simpler than that of selection diversity, its performance is superior to that of selection diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4120593","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of interference and noise limited cellular land mobile radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of interference and noise limited cellular land mobile radio","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049585S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"4","articleId":"140609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140610,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The performance of a direct conversion receiver is investigated. The performance degradation due to various impairments is discussed, and simulated and measured results are compared. Imperfections in the receiver front end as well as degradations due to spurious signals are studied. Signal-to-noise penalty curves for four specific imperfections are presented and possible solutions are recommended to minimize their effects. The results presented are based on a raised cosine Nyquist channel with a roll-off of 0.35.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140610.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"827","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=140610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a direct conversion receiver with pi /4-DQPSK modulated signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Receivers","Packaging","Degradation","Frequency modulation","Digital communication","Manufacturing","Hardware","Analytical models","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","phase shift keying","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase imbalance","inphase branches","analog receiver","cellular radio","direct conversion receiver","pi /4-DQPSK modulated signal","DC offset","self-mixing","carrier feedthrough","local oscillator signals","gain imbalance","quadrature-phase branches","performance degradation","receiver front end","spurious signals","raised cosine Nyquist channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a direct conversion receiver with pi /4-DQPSK modulated signal","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4120594","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a direct conversion receiver with pi /4-DQPSK modulated signal","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031809S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"19","articleId":"140610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":140615,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With this method the bandwidth efficiency is fully preserved because each base station uses the same base pulse. Modulation diversity is achieved by filtering the input symbols with a symbol-spaced finite impulse response (FIR) filter prior to QAM modulation. The tap weights of the FIR filters at different base stations are different. They are chosen such that a necessary condition for optimum diversity gain in time-selective fading is satisfied. Examples for simulcast with two base stations are given. They demonstrate the impact of the choice of tap weights on the energy efficiency, the system complexity, and the performance in the presence of a propagation delay difference between the signals of different base stations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1991.140615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1991.140615","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/504/3782/00140615.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basestation modulation diversity for digital simulcast","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Basestation modulation diversity for digital simulcast","conferenceDate":"19-22 May 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4127304","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basestation modulation diversity for digital simulcast","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00140615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022675S","chronDate":"19-22 May 1991","isNumber":"3782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"504","citationCount":"96","articleId":"140615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":140642,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The method is much simpler compared to existing decoding algorithms for RS codes. However, for large values of p (where p>or=0.2), the performance degrades significantly because for large noise levels the improvement obtained by error correction codes is less significant and is not necessarily worth the calculations and improved error correction techniques. This technique has not only resulted in improvement in signal to noise ratio and error correction capabilities but also saves the bandwidth. This savings was achieved by shortening the block length of RS code by omitting information symbols that do not reduce its minimum distance, and therefore any shortened RS code is also a maximum distance separable code. The use of neural network approaches improved the speed of computation, the simplicity, and robustness in addition to improvement in error correction and signal to noise ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140647/","accessionNumber":"4143238","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decoding a class of nonbinary codes using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding a class of nonbinary codes using neural networks","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00140647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025411S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug 1990","isNumber":"3783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"565","citationCount":"2","articleId":"140647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":140663,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Pulse arithmetic is used to achieve multiplication in synapses. Synapses are implemented as simple four transistor structures, suitable for VLSI fabrication, and can be made small. Both excitatory and inhibitatory synapses are possible by controlling a voltage. Multiplication can therefore be achieved by controlling both the input voltage to the switched-capacitor multiplier, and the input clock frequency. A Hopfield type associative memory is used as a basis for the analysis and simulation. Convergence issues are discussed as well as the functional operation of the system. Results of the analysis are not restricted to Hopfield type associative memories, nor to this particular switched-capacitor filter structure, but are also applicable to other types of neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/140708/","accessionNumber":"4136690","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pulse arithmetic in switched capacitor neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse arithmetic in switched capacitor neural networks","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00140708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041055S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug 1990","isNumber":"3783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"565","citationCount":"2","articleId":"140708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":140741,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, op-amp finite gain-bandwidth product introduces limitations in the performance of this circuit. these limitations are analyzed for the first generation current conveyor. It has been found that the two circuits presented by Huertas have identical characteristic equations. Also, two buffers can be added to the original circuit to reduce loading effects without increasing the amount of pole migration of the dominant poles.

It is shown that with a novel design of the class AB output stage, one would be able to use the gate channel capacitances from standard MOSFETs as the compensation capacitors for the op amp, which would achieve the similar area efficiency as using double-polysilicon capacitors in 2-poly processes. This op amp has good performance characteristic in terms of CMRR, PSRR, and noise level, which makes it very useful in many high-performance circuit applications.

The process allows high-value capacitors to be made using the two polysilicon layers as the conducting plates, thus using a much smaller area than that required by earlier metal-poly capacitors. The BiCMOS process is particularly relevant to making mixed analogue/digital devices; it blends N- and P-channel complementary MOS devices with NPN bipolar devices in the same process, giving the ability to produce CMOS and bipolar transistors on a single chip. This means that high-performance analogue circuits can be mixed with high-density, low-power digital circuits, offering a single-package mixed-signal system. The authors highlight the rapid growth in the mixed-signal ASIC market. They examine the crucial developments taking place in analogue CAD environments, and in the device technologies on which the growth critically depends.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"20 Feb.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"20 Feb. 1992","accessionNumber":"4130466","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Analogue and mixed-signal IC design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analogue and mixed-signal IC design","sourcePdf":"00141011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039404S","chronDate":"20 Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3784","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2188","citationCount":"2","articleId":"141011","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IET Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":141192,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The mechanism for the enhanced avalanche generation and its dependence on bias conditions and geometry have been studied, and pertinent design rules for punchthrough and pinchoff by the buried drain have been established.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.141231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3789/00141231.pdf","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.141231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of SOI-like I-V characteristics for a 64-Mb DRAM SCC MOSFET with a buried drain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141231/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of SOI-like I-V characteristics for a 64-Mb DRAM SCC MOSFET with a buried drain","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4219375","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of SOI-like I-V characteristics for a 64-Mb DRAM SCC MOSFET with a buried drain","sourcePdf":"00141231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026778S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"141231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":141233,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Design curves quantifying the GIDL dependence on gate oxide thickness, phosphorus dose, and spacer length are presented. In addition, a new, quasi-2-D analytical model is developed for the electric field in the gate-to-drain overlap region. This model successfully explains the observed GIDL dependence on the lateral doping profile of the drain. Also, a technique is proposed for extracting this lateral doping profile using the measured dependence of GIDL current on the applied substrate bias. Finally, the GIDL current is found to be much smaller in lightly doped LDD devices than in SD or fully overlapped LDD devices, due to smaller vertical and lateral electric fields. However, as the phosphorus dose approaches 10/sup 14//cm/sup 2/, the LDD and fully overlapped LDD devices exhibit similar GIDL current.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.141236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3789/00141236.pdf","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.141236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design for suppression of gate-induced drain leakage in LDD MOSFETs using a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141236/","displayDocTitle":"Design for suppression of gate-induced drain leakage in LDD MOSFETs using a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4219380","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design for suppression of gate-induced drain leakage in LDD MOSFETs using a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model","sourcePdf":"00141236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052739S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"80","articleId":"141236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":141237,"authors":[{"name":"R.-H.

Requirements on subthreshold leakage control force conventional scaling to use high doping as the device dimension penetrates into the deep-submicrometer regime, leading to an undesirably large junction capacitance and degraded mobility. By studying the scaling of fully depleted SOI devices, the important concept of controlling horizontal leakage through vertical structures is highlighted. Several structural variations of conventional SOI structures are discussed in terms of a natural length scale to guide the design. The concept of vertical doping engineering can also be realized in bulk Si to obtain good subthreshold characteristics without large junction capacitance or heavy channel doping.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.141237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1704","endPage":"1710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/3789/00141237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.141237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling the Si MOSFET: from bulk to SOI to bulk","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Doping","Capacitance","Threshold voltage","Guidelines","Force control","Power supplies","Subthreshold current","Degradation","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor doping","semiconductor-insulator boundaries","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","SOI","subthreshold leakage control","scaling","horizontal leakage","vertical structures","structural variations","natural length scale","vertical doping engineering","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Scaling the Si MOSFET: from bulk to SOI to bulk","volume":"39","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4219381","publicationDate":"July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141237/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling the Si MOSFET: from bulk to SOI to bulk","sourcePdf":"00141237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056097S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"614","articleId":"141237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":141295,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Application of deterministic and stochastic quantitative inversion techniques to configurations similar to those treated in Pt.I by tomographic techniques is discussed. The defects are modeled as cylindrical inhomogeneities concealed within a homogeneous nonmagnetic metallic half-space. Values of the conductivity within the anomaly cross section have to be retrieved from multifrequency anomalous fields observed on a line above and parallel with the surface on the damaged block when a known time-harmonic source illuminates the block. Such quantitative imaging involves the ill-posed inversion of a Fredholm first-kind integral equation with exponentially damped kernel and requires some kind of regularization. In a deterministic context, an iterative algorithm provides a regularized generalized inverse, with the inconvenience that the stopping parameter should be appropriately chosen. In a stochastic context. Kalman filtering rapidly yields a good estimate of the conductivities, which could lead to a more precise but costlier solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eddy current testing of anomalies in conductive materials.

Well-known optimization techniques improve classification performance and convergence rate and reduce the tendency for divergence. Optimization techniques are also applied to the development of a noniterative perceptron-like algorithm, called the vector valued perceptron (VVP). A comparison of the VVP and the backpropagation (BP) algorithms for supervised classification indicates that the performance of VVPs is comparable to BP. VVPs are capable of solving multiclass classification problems such as the exclusive-or-problem, but require significantly less time than BP, especially for sample data with overlapping classes. VVPs applied as an adjunct and preprocessor for NNs in such cases result in improved NN classification performance and reduction in computational time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.141309","startPage":"35","endPage":"46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.141309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3792","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/3792/00141309.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjuncts and alternatives to neural networks for supervised classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141309/","displayDocTitle":"Adjuncts and alternatives to neural networks for supervised classification","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4219516","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjuncts and alternatives to neural networks for supervised classification","sourcePdf":"00141309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064746S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1992","isNumber":"3792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"4","articleId":"141309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":141311,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The RML circuit, consisting of a modulator, demodulator, and comparator circuit, has been fabricated using quasi-monolithic techniques with dimensions of 1.65*4 cm. The relative phase for all four states of the modulator is in close agreement with design values of 90 degrees +or-1 degrees over a 200 MHz bandwidth at 3.95 GHz. The demodulator and comparator circuits of the RML have successfully recovered a 120 Mbit/s bit stream.

This amplifier will be used in millimeter-wave intersatellite communication experiments. For the development of this amplifier, high-power, highly reliable FETs with 0.25- mu m-long gates were designed. The FET large-signal impedance was accurately measured using an improved load-pull method and MMIC transformers. The measurements were used to design two types of MMICs: one composed of two FET cells with 600- mu m-wide gates and the other of four FET cells with 400- mu m-wide gates. A two-stage amplifier package consisting of two of these MMICs that can be used at 38 GHz is also developed. A P/sub o/(1 dB) of 25 dBm and a gain of 11 dB are obtained. A 38-GHz test conducted during chip screening achieves a high production yield without circuits adjustment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.141354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3793/00141354.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1222","doi":"10.1109/22.141354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"38-GHz-band high-power MMIC amplifier module for satellites on board use","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"38-GHz-band high-power MMIC amplifier module for satellites on board use","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4215635","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"38-GHz-band high-power MMIC amplifier module for satellites on board use","sourcePdf":"00141354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035502S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"3","articleId":"141354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":141355,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

Theoretical analysis of such an amplifier with an arbitrary number of sections is presented. The response of the amplifier is controlled by tapering the frequency selectivity or Q of each section of the amplifier. To verify the theory, a three-section amplifier with maximally flat time delay response was designed, constructed, and evaluated. Existing traveling-wave amplifiers were modeled as lossy transmission lines. Although the amplifiers were relatively broadband, a prescribed frequency response was not achieved, and each transistor did not receive an equal portion of the signal power. Resistive elements were required for impedance matching at the input and output. The design seeks to improve on previous techniques by trading bandwidth for controlled gain. By making the transmission line that connects the amplifier sections nonuniform, the frequency response was controlled over the design bandwidth. The designs can easily be implemented using familiar components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.141355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.141355","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/3793/00141355.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traveling-wave amplifiers with prescribed frequency response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Traveling-wave amplifiers with prescribed frequency response","publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4215636","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traveling-wave amplifiers with prescribed frequency response","sourcePdf":"00141355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030484S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","articleId":"141355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":141357,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The effects of forward error correction, switching diversity, automatic gain control (AGC), and squelch are studied. It is shown that OFDM/FM works well with switching diversity because OFDM can average out the transients created by switching between antennas.

The first technique, called disparity-compensated transform-domain predictive coding, attempts to minimize the mean-square error between the original stereopair and the compressed stereopair. The second technique, called mixed-resolution coding, is a psychophysically justified technique that exploits known facts about human stereovision to code stereopairs in a subjectively acceptable manner. A method for assessing the quality of compressed stereopairs is also presented. It involves measuring the ability of an observer to perceive depth in coded stereopairs. It was found that observers generally perceived objects to be further away in compressed stereopairs than they did in originals. It is proved that the rate distortion limit for coding stereopairs cannot in general be achieved by a coder that first codes and decodes the right picture sequence independently of the left picture sequence, and then codes and decodes the left picture sequence given the decoded right picture sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.141424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3795/00141424.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.141424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data compression of stereopairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141424/","displayDocTitle":"Data compression of stereopairs","volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4219547","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data compression of stereopairs","sourcePdf":"00141424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064804S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"163","articleId":"141424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":141426,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The probability distributions of the data rates that can be supported by optimum receiver structures as well as the distribution of the Shannon capacity are studied. The dependences among the important system parameters are exhibited graphically for several illustrative examples including QPSK. At outage probabilities <10/sup -2/ and at operating SNRs of 15-25 dB, the Shannon capacity with optimal dual diversity reception is about 2 bit/s/Hz higher than without diversity. Alternatively, at typical operations of QPSK with 1.5 bit/s/Hz, two orders of magnitude in outage probability can be gained by diversity reception. Comparing the uncoded average probability of error for the optimized MSE systems, at most an order-of-magnitude difference is found among the different equalizers investigated except for the zero-forcing equalizer, whose performance is drastically inferior.

This segmentation system generates hierarchies of features that correspond to structural elements such as boundaries and surfaces of objects. The technique is based on perceptual organization, implemented as a mechanism for exploiting geometrical regularities in the shapes of objects as projected on images. Edges are recursively grouped on geometrical relationships into a description hierarchy ranging from edges to the visible surfaces of objects. These edge groupings, which are termed collated features, are abstract descriptors encoding structural information. The geometrical relationships employed are quasi-invariant over 2-D projections and are common to structures of most objects. Thus, collations have a high likelihood of corresponding to parts of objects. Collations serve as intermediate and high-level features for various visual processes. Applications of collations to stereo correspondence, object-level segmentation, and shape description are illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.141553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3801/00141553.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"635","doi":"10.1109/34.141553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual organization for scene segmentation and description","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual organization for scene segmentation and description","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4219579","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual organization for scene segmentation and description","sourcePdf":"00141553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051555S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"126","articleId":"141553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":141559,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

Then, it is shown that backpropagation is a degenerate form of the extended Kalman filter. The training rules are compared in two examples: an image classification problem using laser radar Doppler imagery and a target detection problem using absolute range images.

Features of these types are used to classify three sets of ultrasonic liver images-normal liver, hepatoma, and cirrhosis (30 samples each). The Bayes classifier and the Hotelling trace criterion are employed to evaluate the performance of these features. From the viewpoint of speed and accuracy of classification, it is found that these features do not perform well enough. Hence, a new texture feature set (multiresolution fractal features) based on multiple resolution imagery and the fractional Brownian motion model is proposed to detect diffuse liver diseases quickly and accurately. Fractal dimensions estimated at various resolutions of the image are gathered to form the feature vector. Texture information contained in the proposed feature vector is discussed. A real-time implementation of the algorithm produces about 90% correct classification for the three sets of ultrasonic liver images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.141636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3805/00141636.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.141636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture features for classification of ultrasonic liver images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141636/","displayDocTitle":"Texture features for classification of ultrasonic liver images","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4219076","pubMedId":"18218367","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture features for classification of ultrasonic liver images","sourcePdf":"00141636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050137S","chronDate":"June  1992","isNumber":"3805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"325","articleId":"141636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":141643,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-Q.

Extensions of this technique support 3-D and multiecho magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), incorporating higher spatial and spectral dimensions. The procedure overcomes the major drawbacks of conventional filter methods, namely the blurring of object boundaries and the suppression of fine structural details. The simplicity of the filter algorithm permits an efficient implementation, even on small workstations. The efficient noise reduction and sharpening of object boundaries are demonstrated by applying this image processing technique to 2-D and 3-D spin echo and gradient echo MR data.

The main advantages of the algorithm are the small amount of computation time needed, and that it only requires information available from an ordinary program for power flow calculations. The proposed method fully utilizes the sparsity of the power flow Jacobian matrix and the memory requirements for the computation are low. These advantages are preserved when applied to various submatrices of the Jacobian matrix. The algorithm was applied to small test systems and to a large system with over 1000 nodes, with satisfactory results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.141687","startPage":"54","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.141687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3807","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3807/00141687.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast calculation of a voltage stability index","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141687/","displayDocTitle":"Fast calculation of a voltage stability index","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4162703","publicationDate":"Feb. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast calculation of a voltage stability index","sourcePdf":"00141687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036398S","chronDate":"Feb.  1992","isNumber":"3807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"289","articleId":"141687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":141688,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To speed up the training process, a learning algorithm for the adaptive training of neural networks is presented. The effectiveness of the neural network with the proposed adaptive learning algorithm is demonstrated by short-term load forecasting of the Taiwan power system. It is found that, once trained by the proposed learning algorithm, the neural network can yield the desired hourly load forecast efficiently and accurately.

When the load contains static components, stability limits extend considerably. The exact limit for such loads can also be determined from a power flow model, properly modified to reflect the static component of the load. In specific situations, where the bulk of the load is composed of fast response loads, a correct assessment of voltage stability would require comprehensive analyses, employing detailed dynamic models of all system components.

Digital simulations of the system following a three-phase fault under different loading conditions were performed to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.141778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3808/00141778.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"725","doi":"10.1109/59.141778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of generator oscillations using an adaptive static VAR compensator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"Damping of generator oscillations using an adaptive static VAR compensator","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4181209","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of generator oscillations using an adaptive static VAR compensator","sourcePdf":"00141778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035849S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"54","articleId":"141778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":141781,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","id":"37271365300"},{"name":"Kun-Long Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kun-Long Ho","id":"38164566700"},{"name":"Chih-Chien Liang","affiliation":["System Operation Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Chien Liang","id":"37289741900"},{"name":"Tsau-Shin Lai","affiliation":["System Operation Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsau-Shin Lai","id":"38225642200"},{"name":"Kung-Keng Chen","affiliation":["System Operation Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kung-Keng Chen","id":"37349548400"},{"name":"Biao-Sheng Chang","affiliation":["System Operation Department, Taiwan Power Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Biao-Sheng Chang","id":"37325615500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"141781","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"abstract":"An expert system which combines operators' dispatching rules and the integer linear programming (LP) routine is designed for voltage control of the Taiwan Power Company. To reach the control actions at one time and to avoid the need of rounding off the control actions for capacitors/inductors and transformer taps, the efficient integer LP routine is developed using the branch-and-bound algorithm. The operators' heuristic rules and sensitivity factors are used to reduce the number of variables and constraints in the integer LP formulation in order to reduce the computational time and to make the approach feasible in real-time situations. The expert system was applied to correct abnormal voltages during emergency conditions. It was found that the proposed expert system is a valuable aid to system operators for voltage control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3808/00141781.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.141781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.141781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage control using a combined integer linear programming and rule-based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Integer linear programming","Expert systems","Artificial intelligence","Reactive power","Control systems","Power systems","Inductors","Capacitors","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert systems","integer programming","linear programming","load dispatching","optimal control","power system computer control","real-time systems","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Taiwan","power system computer control","load dispatching","capacitors","inductors","integer linear programming","rule-based approach","expert system","voltage control","transformer taps","algorithm","heuristic rules","sensitivity factors","real-time","emergency conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"Voltage control using a combined integer linear programming and rule-based approach","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4181212","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage control using a combined integer linear programming and rule-based approach","sourcePdf":"00141781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040968S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"14","articleId":"141781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":141783,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

The first large commercial application of a BSP, the Bewag 8.5/17 MW installation, has been in successful operation since January 1987. A brief history of the Bewag development is provided. There are three important advantages of BSP: there are no environmental difficulties to placing them within urban areas; there is an instantly accessible output of MW and MVAr; and commercial consumers requiring a higher reliability will meet much of the capital cost. Utilities would need to offer tariff incentives to gain an operational control of the BSP. The ability for extremely fast output changes of MW and MVAr outputs, coupled with their energy storage, would make BSPs useful for normal and emergency operation as well as speeding up system restoration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141783/","volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4181214","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Battery storage plant within large load centres","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery storage plant within large load centres","sourcePdf":"00141783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043839S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"33","articleId":"141783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":141790,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Three types of neural network models have been studied and are compared. These networks can sense AC bus voltages either as root mean square (RMS) values (with or without phase angle information) or as sampled instantaneous values of sine waves. Depending on which method is used, some confusion can occur in distinguishing a line to line fault from a remote AC fault. A delay of 1-2 cycles in detection of faults when using RMS values is expected due to the algorithm required for determining the RMS value. This may not be too critical in practice. However, where this delay is unacceptable, instantaneous values may be used. Based on the ability of these networks to distinguish reliably between different types of faults, appropriate control measures can be taken to improve the dynamic performance of the AC-DC power system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4181221","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault identification in an AC-DC transmission system using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault identification in an AC-DC transmission system using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00141790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071558S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"74","articleId":"141790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":141793,"authors":[{"name":"T.-K.

The application of this classifier to power system security assessment is presented, and simulation results are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.141797","startPage":"865","endPage":"872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.141797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3808/00141797.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system static security assessment using the Kohonen neural network classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141797/","displayDocTitle":"Power system static security assessment using the Kohonen neural network classifier","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4181228","publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system static security assessment using the Kohonen neural network classifier","sourcePdf":"00141797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038138S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"78","articleId":"141797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":141799,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-H.

In this connection, the critical clearing time (CCT) is an attribute which provides significant information about the quality of the postfault system behavior. It may be regarded as a complex mapping of the prefault, fault-on, and postfault system conditions into the time domain. High prediction and generalization capabilities of artificial neural networks provide the basis for synthesis of such a complex mapping carrying input pattern attributes into the single valued space of the CCT. The authors consider the possibility of using unsupervised and supervised learning programs to discover what combination of raw measurements is significant in determining CCT. Correlation analysis and a Euclidean metric are used to specify interfeature dependencies. An example of a four-machine power system is used to illustrate the suggested approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3808/00141799.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.141799","doi":"10.1109/59.141799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=141799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supervised learning","Power system dynamics","Information security","Power system security","Power system stability","Artificial neural networks","Network synthesis","Euclidean distance","Power system analysis computing","Power system measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","power system analysis computing","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised learning","prefault system","fault-on system","correlation analysis","supervised learning","dynamic security assessment","security","stability","electric power systems","critical clearing time","postfault system behavior","time domain","artificial neural networks","Euclidean metric","four-machine power system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"Combined use of unsupervised and supervised learning for dynamic security assessment","accessionNumber":"4181230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined use of unsupervised and supervised learning for dynamic security assessment","sourcePdf":"00141799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028619S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"72","articleId":"141799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":141801,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An application of the proposed optimization technique to hydro-scheduling is presented. The largest problem comprised 880 variables and 3680 constraints and was solved over nine times faster than an efficient simplex (MINOS) code. As the problem size grows, the speedup ratio over the simplex method also increases. A new heuristic basis recovery procedure was implemented to provide primal and dual optimal basic solutions.

Numerical simulations show that EDFAs can convert a continuous-wave optical signal into a train of high-repetition rate femtosecond pulses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.141968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3812/00141968.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"564","doi":"10.1109/68.141968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation instability in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1992","displayDocTitle":"Modulation instability in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4212149","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/141968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation instability in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00141968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027696S","chronDate":"June  1992","isNumber":"3812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"46","articleId":"141968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":141969,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is inherently slightly conservative and thus appropriate for use in design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOS devices","Threshold voltage","Parasitic capacitance","Transconductance","Differential amplifiers","Random access memory","Closed-form solution","Signal restoration","Fabrication","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","DRAM chips","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatch sensitivity","CMOS sense amplifier","vertically matched","DRAMs","threshold voltage mismatch","parasitic capacitance mismatch","transconductance mismatch","bitline load capacitance mismatch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/82.142029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/3814/00142029.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.142029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field 24 amended in b/hAnalysis of mismatch sensitivity in a simulataneously latched CMOS sense amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Field 24 amended in b/hAnalysis of mismatch sensitivity in a simulataneously latched CMOS sense amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142029/","volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4217059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field 24 amended in b/hAnalysis of mismatch sensitivity in a simulataneously latched CMOS sense amplifier","sourcePdf":"00142029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032883S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"4","articleId":"142029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":142032,"authors":[{"name":"L.G.

However, its frequency selectivity and passband response are poor. It is shown that the sliding FFT filter bank is in fact a particular member of a new family of fast filter banks (FFBs). In the case of FFT, each cluster of butterflies can in fact be derived from a pair of complementary two-tap (i.e. first-order) prototype FIR filters. The poor selectivity and degraded passband response of the FFT filter bank is a direct consequence of the poor frequency response of the prototype first-order filter. It is shown that by increasing the order of the prototype filters, it is possible to implement a filter bank with arbitrarily good selectivity and flat passband response. The FFB retains the low-complexity feature of the FFT. Because of its very much improved frequency response characteristics, the FFB be suitable for use in many applications where the FFT filter bank is unsuitable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/3814/00142033.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.142033","doi":"10.1109/82.142033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Very large scale integration","Passband","Prototypes","Finite impulse response filter","Frequency response","Digital signal processing","Signal processing","Band pass filters","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","fast Fourier transforms","filtering and prediction theory","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","frequency selectivity","passband response","sliding FFT filter bank","fast filter banks","prototype FIR filters","frequency response characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fast filter bank (FFB)","accessionNumber":"4217063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast filter bank (FFB)","sourcePdf":"00142033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021838S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"55","articleId":"142033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":142036,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Therefore, the FFTSBD can be used to recognize an object at various locations, orientations, and distances from the camera and various objects of the same family that are stretched along an axis. FFTSBD can also be used to recognize heavily occluded objects, provided that the endpoints of the major axis are visible, and to recognize family of objects stretching along an axis, provided that the endpoints of that axis are visible.

During a learning process, the error backpropagation method and the delta rule are used to adjust the connection strengths in the networks. To adjust the connection strengths of the network that acts as a controller, the error signals are backpropagated through the network that models the unknown system to be controlled.

The definition of these requirements is based on surveying existing literature on teleoperation, robotics, and human factors to determine if sufficient knowledge in this area is available to adequately specify appropriate requirements. An idealized design goal based on the concept of telepresence is presented. To further clarify the response requirements, the control problem is divided into the two major components of teleoperation: the human operator and the telerobot. The literature survey showed that humans have asymmetrical input/output capabilities. It was also found that a human does not have one single relevant bandwidth, but rather that bandwidth is a function of the human's mode of operation. A survey was conducted in which 12 experts were queried to find a consensus based on experience. These results are presented and recommendations are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1990.142071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1990.142071","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/509/3815/00142071.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telerobotic response requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1990","displayDocTitle":"Telerobotic response requirements","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4117059","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telerobotic response requirements","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00142071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063484S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"509","citationCount":"134","articleId":"142071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":142084,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Given a FANN topology, an adaptive learning algorithm to adjust its parameters is presented. The algorithm consists of two steps: generating a direction, and performing a one-dimensional search along that direction. A methodology to obtain the most appropriate topology and assess its parameters, using the adaptive learning algorithm as a subroutine, is developed. When the set of training patterns changes, the FANN model can adapt itself to the changes by retraining or expanding the existing model. The theoretical basis for the adaptive FANN and some examples are included. How to formulate MCDM problems and use the adaptive FANN to select the best alternative when each alternative is associated with a set of conflicting and noncommensurate criteria is shown.

The basic idea is divide-and-conquer. The principle is explored systematically, and it is shown through several examples that it should benefit the design of ANN and its learning algorithms in general. Three types of subgoal decomposabilities are identified: serial, parallel, and diameter-limited. It is shown that the scaling-up difficulties and that of decoding what structure to use for a problem may be solved or alleviated using the subgoal decomposition principle. A learning algorithm based on the principle is developed for training multilayer perceptrons to classify any nonlinearly separable clusters. Convergence to the correct classification is guaranteed if the patterns are separable. The algorithm simultaneously learns the structure and connection weights of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142087/","accessionNumber":"4117074","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Problem decomposition and subgoaling in artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Problem decomposition and subgoaling in artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00142087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035052S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"509","citationCount":"9","articleId":"142087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":142088,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The methods were tested on a bus-based multiprocessor running two backpropagation network simulators, and the simulation results are reported.

Optical local changes in the incident beam dose, found iteratively, require a prohibitively long time to compute for realistic pattern sizes. A neural network was trained to perform equivalent corrections, resulting in a significant decrease in computation time. Hardware implementations of the networks for this application, using both analog and digital electronic networks, were examined. Although the analog hardware was potentially faster, the digital network has the advantage of being much more flexible. Both networks had an acceptably small error of 0.5% compared to the results of the iterative computation. The neural network correctly generalized the solution of the problem to include patterns not contained in its training set.

A dense grid of rays representing the incident plane wave is shot toward the inhomogeneous objects. At the scatterer boundary, reflected rays and refracted rays are generated due to the discontinuity of the medium parameters. The trajectory, amplitude, phase and polarization of the rays inside the inhomogeneous object are traced based on geometrical optics. Whenever the rays cross the scatterer surface, additional reflected/refracted rays are generated and are tracked. This is repeated until the intensities of the refracted/reflected rays become negligible. The contributions of the existing rays to the total scattered field are calculated using the equivalence principle in conjunction with a ray-tube integration scheme. The ray formulation is applied to calculate the backscattering from cylinders and spheres and good agreement with the exact series solutions is observed in the high-frequency range. In addition, the backscattering mechanisms in penetrable objects are interpreted in terms of simple ray pictures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic scattering from an inhomogeneous object by ray tracing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.142626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3821/00142626.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.142626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic scattering from an inhomogeneous object by ray tracing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4236233","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic scattering from an inhomogeneous object by ray tracing","sourcePdf":"00142626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066175S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","articleId":"142626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":142627,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The network model successfully learned all of the trajectories presented to it. The model has many attractive properties, such as limit cycle behavior, generalization of trajectories and frequencies, phase maintenance, and fault tolerance. The movement pattern generator model is potentially applicable for improved understanding of animal locomotion and for use in legged robots and rehabilitation medicine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4226479","pubMedId":"1516938","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A movement pattern generator model using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A movement pattern generator model using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00142646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033106S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"24","articleId":"142646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":142658,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The chemical analysis of the deteriorated region by FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy showed that it contains excess carbonyl groups (C=O) and double bonds (C=C) compared to normal polyethylene. Scanning electron microscope observation found in the deteriorated region a number of voids with diameter <0.5 mu m. The observation by transmission electron microscope revealed that the lamellar structure of polyethylene is destroyed in the deteriorated region. It was found that tree initiation voltages for AC ramp and positive impulse are increased after the formation of the deteriorated region. The change of polyethylene structure is considered to be responsible for the increase of treeing resistance. It is worth noticing that the formation of the deteriorated region has a possibility as a new way for voltage hardening of practical apparatus.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/14.142714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3825","startPage":"513","endPage":"518","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/3825/00142714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.142714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical tree and deteriorated region in polyethylene","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polyethylene","Scanning electron microscopy","Chemical analysis","Needles","Transmission electron microscopy","Low voltage","Erbium","Electrodes","Petrochemicals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bonds (chemical)","dielectric properties of solids","electric breakdown of solids","organic insulating materials","polymer structure","polymers","scanning electron microscope examination of materials","spectrochemical analysis","transmission electron microscope examination of materials","voids (solid)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FTIR spectra","SEM","TEM","polyethylene","high electric fields","deteriorated region","chemical analysis","Raman spectroscopy","excess carbonyl groups","double bonds","voids","lamellar structure","tree initiation voltages","treeing resistance","voltage hardening"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Electrical tree and deteriorated region in polyethylene","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4236313","publicationDate":"June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical tree and deteriorated region in polyethylene","sourcePdf":"00142714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029706S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"54","articleId":"142714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":142717,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Input information for the NN was a combination of the discharge magnitude, the number of pulse counts and the phase angle of applied voltage in which PD is produced. PD measurement was carried out using a PD pulse recorder for a 66 kV XLPE cable with an artificial defect under a 38 kV AC applied voltage. After learning 30 typical input patterns, the NN discriminated unknown patterns with 90% correct responses. The time duration including measuring time required for the NN to discriminate PD signal was approximately 30 s. In a long-term performance test of a 66 kV XLPE cable with an artificial defect, the NN-based alarm processor was able to recognize the presence of PD 1 h before breakdown of the cable, and successfully alerted the operator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/14.142717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/3825/00142717.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.142717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern recognition of partial discharge in XLPE cables using a neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142717/","displayDocTitle":"Pattern recognition of partial discharge in XLPE cables using a neural network","volume":"27","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4231731","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern recognition of partial discharge in XLPE cables using a neural network","sourcePdf":"00142717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037322S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"59","articleId":"142717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":142718,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is assumed that the fading is slow with respect to the rate of symbol transmission. Expressions are derived for the probabilities of channel symbol error and erasure, which are in turn used to develop expressions for code symbol error and erasure. Two erasure generation mechanisms are considered, one based on the existence of channel amplitude side information, the other not. This analytical framework is used to evaluate the performance of the Reed-Solomon/hybrid-ARQ protocol (RS/HARQ) over fading channels with feedback. The RS/HARQ system uses erasure decoding in a hybrid-ARQ protocol to provide excellent reliability performance at the expense of a reduction in throughput. The RS/HARQ protocol allows for the variation of the erasure threshold and the effective diameter of the decoding operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.142771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3827/00142771.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.142771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reed-Solomon error control coding for Rayleigh fading channels with feedback","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Reed-Solomon error control coding for Rayleigh fading channels with feedback","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4219487","volume":"41","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reed-Solomon error control coding for Rayleigh fading channels with feedback","sourcePdf":"00142771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062134S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"48","articleId":"142771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":142772,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

For tractability, attention is restricted to the case in which the channel variations are not tracked using decision-directed adaptation. The results suggest that unless the system parameters are carefully chosen, the constant-channel assumption is far from accurate. The quantitative results also offer a measure of the rate of channel time-variations, and give guidelines for deciding when those variations can be considered slow.

It is shown that Delta Theta =200 degrees and f/sub H/=67 Hz can be used when m (interleaving depth)=10 b. Hence, excessively long interleaving is not required by the use of transmitter diversity. Under very slow Rayleigh fading (f/sub D/=1 Hz), a measured improvement of 4.8 dB is obtained at a word error rate of 10/sup -2/ without receiver diversity. Applications include paging systems that require very simple receivers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"170","endPage":"176","doi":"10.1109/25.142775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.142775","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3827/00142775.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined effects of phase sweeping transmitter diversity and channel coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Combined effects of phase sweeping transmitter diversity and channel coding","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4219491","volume":"41","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined effects of phase sweeping transmitter diversity and channel coding","sourcePdf":"00142775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032428S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"111","articleId":"142775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":142776,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Symbol blocks from an inverse DFT (IDFT) are cyclically extended to generate ISI-free channel-output symbols that decompose the channel into a group of orthogonal and independent parallel subchannels. Asymptotic performance of this system is derived, and examples of asymptotic and finite block length coding gain performance for several channels are evaluated at different values of bits per sample.

The Nakagami-m fading model is used as an alternative to the Rician fading model to calculate the error probability upper bound for trellis-coded schemes on the fading channel. The likeliness and the disparity between the upper bounds to the error probability for the two fading models are discussed. The design criteria for the one-sided normal fading channel, modeled by the Nakagami-m distribution, are observed to be the same as those for the Rayleigh-fading channel. For the MTCM/FPM schemes, it is demonstrated that the set partitioning designed to maximize symbol diversity (optimum for fading channels) is optimum for performance on the AWGN channel as well.

With hot-potato routing, all packets simultaneously arriving at a given node and not intended for reception at that node are immediately placed onto the outbound links leaving that node; if two or more packets contend for the same outgoing link to achieve a minimum distance routing, then all but one will be misrouted to links which produce longer paths to the eventual destination. Attention is confined to the development of an analytical methodology for finding the probability distribution of the number of hops with hot potato routing for symmetric networks under uniform traffic load. Results show that the maximum throughput achievable with hot-potato routing can be as low as 25% of that for store-and-forward routing, and that the relative degradation increases as the number of nodes grows larger. This implies that the link speed up needed to produce a significant overall capacity advantage with hot potato should be at least a factor of 10.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.142798","startPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3828/00142798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.142798","endPage":"1090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop lightwave networks: a comparison of store-and-forward and hot-potato routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multihop lightwave networks: a comparison of store-and-forward and hot-potato routing","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4226549","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop lightwave networks: a comparison of store-and-forward and hot-potato routing","sourcePdf":"00142798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041664S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"107","articleId":"142798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":142801,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Based on an analytical study of the stability problems of gyrotron traveling wave amplifiers (gyro-TWTs), an extremely high power second-harmonic gyro-TWT has been designed, evaluated and optimized with a self-consistent nonlinear numerical simulation code. The design, which is based on the magnetron-injection-gun (MIG)-type beam, is presented. Using a 100 kV, 25 A MIG beam with alpha =1 and an axial velocity spread of 5%, nonlinear self-consistent analysis of a three-stage second-harmonic gyro-TWT amplifier predicts a peak output power of 533 kW, peak efficiency of 21.3% and a 7.4% saturated bandwidth, which verifies the theoretical predictions that a stable harmonic gyro-TWT can generate power levels an order of magnitude higher than those possible from a fundamental gyro-TWT. It is shown that the positioning of the electron beam is very important. A multistage structure is used to recover the loss in gain resulting from shortening the interaction sections to ensure stability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.142816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.142816","startPage":"163","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/3829/00142816.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-power harmonic gyro-TWT's.

The efficiency of a fourth-harmonic device with an ideal 60 kV, 5 A beam is shown to reach 30% for alpha identical to nu /sub perpendicular to // nu /sub z/=2. The growth rate for the pi mode is roughly 25% larger than for the 2 pi mode. The efficiency increases for lower voltage and the device is found to be moderately sensitive to the radial spread of the beam's guiding center position and extremely sensitive to the axial velocity spread. For an ideal 60 kV, 5 A beam with alpha =1.5, the efficiency of a second-harmonic gyro-TWT is 42% and falls to 10% for an eighth-harmonic device. The design of a 35 GHz, 60 kV, 5A, alpha =1.5, eight-vane, fourth-harmonic gyro-TWT with 7% axial velocity spread is presented. It is predicted that this design will yield a peak output power of 90 kW, a peak efficiency of 30%, and 6.3% saturated bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic fields","Cyclotrons","Gyrotrons","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Frequency","Electron beams","Power generation","High power amplifiers","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyrotrons","harmonic generation","microwave amplifiers","travelling-wave-tubes","waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear self-consistent simulation code","slotted gyrotron traveling-wave amplifier","axis-encircling electron beam","high-order azimuthal mode","magnetron-type waveguide","efficiency","fourth-harmonic device","pi mode","2 pi mode","axial velocity spread","second-harmonic gyro-TWT","eighth-harmonic device","fourth-harmonic gyro-TWT","peak output power","saturated bandwidth","60 kV","5 A","30 percent","10 to 42 percent","35 GHz","90 kW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/27.142818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/3829/00142818.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.142818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear analysis of high-harmonic slotted gyro-TWT amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear analysis of high-harmonic slotted gyro-TWT amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142818/","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4231819","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear analysis of high-harmonic slotted gyro-TWT amplifier","sourcePdf":"00142818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038245S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"33","articleId":"142818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":142819,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

Fast wave interaction allows the requirements on the beam's quality to be relaxed compared with slow wave interaction. A low- alpha ( identical to nu /sub perpendicular to // nu /sub z/) electron beam is chosen to avoid the absolute instability and minimize the possibility of dielectric charging. This device is investigated using a self-consistent single-mode, large-signal simulation based on a slow time scale formulation. Simulation results show that a constant drive bandwidth of 20% can be achieved for a 100 kV, 5 A electron beam with a velocity ratio of alpha =0.59 and an axial velocity spread of 2.0%. The growth rate is relatively low because of the low alpha of the electron beam. The design of a proof-of-principle experiment is described. The tube is expected to deliver a power of 80 kW from 9 to 11 GHz with 15% efficiency and a saturated gain of 30 dB. The performance of a single-anode magnetron injection gun designed to produce the required high-quality electron beam has been studied through simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4231820","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric-loaded wideband gyro-TWT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric-loaded wideband gyro-TWT","sourcePdf":"00142819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040818S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"42","articleId":"142819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":142821,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

This is a result of the opposite energy dependence of the bunching mechanism for the two interactions. Magnetic field profiling has also been shown to have a very strong effect on the amplifier efficiency, both through beam loading effects in detuning the penultimate cavity and through enhanced energy extraction in the output cavity.

The space charge recirculation through the drift space provides the main coupling mechanism between the output and the input. The output fluctuations among successive tube passes in the RF power, phase shift and hub density generate a narrow bandwidth around the carrier. By fixing the external control parameters and varying the secondary emission coefficient or the recirculating hub charge fraction, the pass-to-pass fluctuations exhibit transitions from steady-state to periodic limit cycles and finally to unpredictable, chaotic behavior. It is shown that the development of chaotic output patterns is connected with slow, large-amplitude hub density oscillations during a single pass. Analysis shows that the nonlinear and time-delay effects characterizing the hub density evolution cause unstable, oscillatory behavior. The influence of excess space charge accumulation on the tube intrinsic noise is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/27.142837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/27.142837","startPage":"360","endPage":"369","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/27/3829/00142837.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-induced noise in crossed field devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-induced noise in crossed field devices","publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4236382","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142837/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-induced noise in crossed field devices","sourcePdf":"00142837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033691S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"11","articleId":"142837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":142857,"authors":[{"name":"Wai-Kuen Cham","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wai-Kuen Cham","id":"37271285100"},{"name":"Chiu-Sing Choy","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chiu-Sing Choy","id":"37270085300"},{"name":"Wai-Kit Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wai-Kit Lam","id":"37388241400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"142857","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Kernel","Discrete transforms","Image coding","Image processing","Large scale integration","Transform coding","Wiring","Low pass filters","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","computerised picture processing","data compression","digital signal processing chips","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image compression","2-D integer cosine transform chip set","2D-ICT (10,9,6,2,9,3)","custom designed chips","ICT chip","data sequencer chip","gate array","speed","image processing unit","image archiving systems","electronic albums","3 micron"]}],"abstract":"An integer cosine transform denoted ICT (10,9,6,2,9,3) has been shown to be a promising alternative discrete cosine transform (DCT) for its implementation simplicity, close performance, and compatibility to the DCT.

An energy detector is developed in the cumulant domain by exploiting the noise insensitivity of higher order statistics. An efficient implementation of this detector is described, using matched filtering. Its performance is analyzed using asymptotic distributions in a binary hypothesis-testing framework. The object and texture discriminant functions are minimum distance classifiers in the cumulant domain and can be efficiently implemented using a bank of matched filters. They are immune to additive Gaussian noise and insensitive to object shifts. Important extensions, which can handle object rotation and scaling, are also discussed. An alternative texture classifier is derived from a ML viewpoint and is statistically efficient at the expense of complexity.

They compare a piecewise-linear classification method with classification based on a single linear separator. A precise methodology for comparing the relative efficacy of two classification methods for a particular task is described and is applied to the comparison on the breast cancer data of the relative performances of the two versions of the piecewise-linear classifier and the classification based on an optimal linear separator. It is found that for this data set, the piecewise-linear classifier that uses all the hyperplanes needed to separate the training set outperforms the other two methods and that these differences in performance are significant at the 0.001 level. There is no statistically significant difference between the performance of the other two methods. The authors discuss the relevance of these results for this and other applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.142914","startPage":"782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3833/00142914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.142914","endPage":"786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On piecewise-linear classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"On piecewise-linear classification","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4241512","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On piecewise-linear classification","sourcePdf":"00142914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065794S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"25","articleId":"142914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":142920,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

To accomplish this, it is necessary to increase the spatial resolution of the 19- and 22-GHz channels while degrading that of the 85-GHz channel. It is found that the approach produces adequate enhancement of the spatial resolution to make such a correction worthwhile. Results suggest that this technique decreases brightness temperature differences stemming solely from spatial resolution differences by over 50% for the low resolution channels with only a modest increase in random noise. The correction can also help to better resolve small features which would otherwise be lost due to the lack of resolution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3834/00142920.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.142920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.142920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A technique for enhancing and matching the resolution of microwave measurements from the SSM/I instrument","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave measurements","Spatial resolution","Geophysical measurements","Instruments","Satellites","Frequency measurement","Image sensors","Microwave sensors","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric techniques","geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics","satellite remote sensing","measurement","land surface","radiometry","atmosphere","meteorology","technique","enhancing","matching","microwave","SSM/I","correction","Special Sensor Microwave/Imager","spatial resolution","37 GHz","19 to 85 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","displayDocTitle":"A technique for enhancing and matching the resolution of microwave measurements from the SSM/I instrument","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4226627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for enhancing and matching the resolution of microwave measurements from the SSM/I instrument","sourcePdf":"00142920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052331S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"59","articleId":"142920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":142926,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The remaining bands are predicted from the quantized images. Two different types of predictors are examined, an affine predictor and a new nonlinear predictor. The residual (error) images are encoded at a second stage based on the magnitude of the errors. This scheme simultaneously exploits both spatial and spectral correlation inherent in multispectral images. Simulation results on an image set from the Thematic Mapper with seven spectral bands provide a comparison of the affine predictor with the nonlinear predictor. It is shown that the nonlinear predictor provides significantly improved performance compared to the affine predictor. Image compression ratios between 15 and 25 are achieved with remarkably good image quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.142927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/3834/00142927.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.142927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature predictive vector quantization of multispectral images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=142927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/142927/","displayDocTitle":"Feature predictive vector quantization of multispectral images","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4226634","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature predictive vector quantization of multispectral images","sourcePdf":"00142927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03324S","chronDate":"May 1992","isNumber":"3834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"57","articleId":"142927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":142933,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For ultra-short pulse excitation of 150 fs at lambda =620 nm the photoresponse is found to be less than 13 ps FWHM for detectors with 1 mu m finger spacing. Above a certain level of illumination, the peak amplitude increases sublinearly and the relative contribution of the tail to the detector response is appreciably enhanced. The screening of the electric field by photo-generated space charges is responsible for this nonlinearity. For detectors with 5 mu m finger spacing illuminated with 1.3 mu m light pulses (FWHM=33 ps), space charge perturbation of the impulse response manifests itself by a decrease of the FWHM and an increase of the fall time with increasing illumination level. The practical consequences for the performance of MSM detectors in various applications are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.143074","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3836/00143074.pdf","startPage":"753","endPage":"759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.143074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of space charges on the impulse response of InGaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of space charges on the impulse response of InGaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4231318","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of space charges on the impulse response of InGaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","sourcePdf":"00143074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044897S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"47","articleId":"143074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":143082,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

A very simple coded excitation for phased arrays based on the principles of 'pseudochirp' excitation and equalization filtering is described.

Based on the constraints of catheter-based systems, an efficient synthetic aperture method has been developed for imaging using a single wire connection between the imaging array and external electronics. The method employs a highly sampled array with an element pitch small compared to the acoustic wavelength. On any given firing of the array, however, a large number of channels are electrically connected on both transmission and reception. From firing to firing, one element is dropped and one new element is included, in analogy to a classic linear array system. Using an optimal filtering approach for synthetic aperture reconstruction, a dynamically focused image exhibiting diffraction limited resolution is produced. The results of detailed simulations are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the method. In addition, the prospects for real-time implementation of the reconstruction are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.143171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3839","startPage":"366","endPage":"380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/3839/00143171.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient synthetic aperture imaging from a circular aperture with possible application to catheter-based imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient synthetic aperture imaging from a circular aperture with possible application to catheter-based imaging","publicationDate":"May 1992","accessionNumber":"4232399","pubMedId":"18267647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient synthetic aperture imaging from a circular aperture with possible application to catheter-based imaging","sourcePdf":"00143171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050406S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"110","articleId":"143171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":143172,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

The sensitivity of the Lamb modes a/sub 1/, alpha /sub 0/, and s/sub 0/ to simulated defects in different frequency-thickness regions is predicted as a function of the defect depth to plate thickness ratio and the results indicate that Lamb waves may be used to find notches when the wavelength to notch depth ratio is on the order of 40.

The MLE processes sampled RF A-scans from broadband ultrasonic pulse-echo systems. A major source of interference for these signals is the backscattered energy from the unresolvable scatterers that exist throughout the beam field. A statistical model is formulated that characterizes the backscattered energy from a resolution cell when a coherent target scatterer is present. It is shown that the MLE is equivalent to a matched filter when the distribution of the interfering back-scatter energy is stationary over the resolution cell. In addition, the form of the MLE is described when the interfering echoes are not stationary within the resolution cell. Experimental results are presented for an adaptive implementation of the MLE applied to flaw detection in stainless steel. The results demonstrate the ability of the MLE to reveal targets masked by grain echoes, without prior knowledge of the gain-echo spectral characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.143176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.143176","startPage":"422","endPage":"431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/3839/00143176.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of A-scan amplitudes for coherent targets in media of unresolvable scatterers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1992","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of A-scan amplitudes for coherent targets in media of unresolvable scatterers","publicationDate":"May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4232404","pubMedId":"18267652","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143176/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of A-scan amplitudes for coherent targets in media of unresolvable scatterers","sourcePdf":"00143176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039216S","chronDate":"May  1992","isNumber":"3839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"26","articleId":"143176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":143178,"authors":[{"name":"J.-Y.

The Lie bracket condition (LBC) can be used to check for the possibility of integral surfaces, also called stable surfaces, which define regions of repeatable behavior. However, the LBC is only a necessary condition. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable surfaces is used to illustrate that such surfaces are much rarer than previously thought. A technique for designing a repeatable control that is nearest, in an integral norm sense, to a desired optimal control is presented. The desired optimal control is allowed to take the form of any generalized inverse. An example is presented that illustrates the capability of designing repeatable controls that approximate the behavior of desired optimal inverses in selected regions of the workspace.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3847/00143351.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.143351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.143351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nearest optimal repeatable control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Jacobian matrices","Sufficient conditions","Manipulators","Trajectory","Testing","Integral equations","Robots","Kinematics","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","kinematics","optimal control","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","kinematically redundant manipulators","joint space","Lie bracket condition","necessary condition","sufficient condition","repeatable control","optimal control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Nearest optimal repeatable control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4228149","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearest optimal repeatable control strategies for kinematically redundant manipulators","sourcePdf":"00143351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031603S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"51","articleId":"143351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":143353,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Refinement theory is extended to include reversibility of Petri nets. Parallel and sequential mutual exclusions are used to model shared resources. Design of the first-level Petri nets is discussed, and two basic kinds of Petri nets, choice-free and choice-synchronization, are given to cope with different types of manufacturing systems. The major advantages of the method are that the modeling details can be introduced in incremental ways such that complexity can be handled, and the important properties of the resulting Petri net are guaranteed so that costly mathematical analysis for boundedness, liveness, and reversibility can be avoided. A manufacturing system consisting of four machines, one assembly cell, two shared robots, and two buffers is used to illustrate the design methodology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.143353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/3847/00143353.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.143353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143353/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid methodology for synthesis of Petri net models for manufacturing systems","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4228151","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid methodology for synthesis of Petri net models for manufacturing systems","sourcePdf":"00143353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088238S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"360","articleId":"143353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":143355,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The cooperative manipulation problem is analyzed from a systems perspective, and the desirable features of a control system for cooperative manipulation are discussed. A control policy is developed that enforces a controlled impedance not of the individual arm endpoints, but of the manipulated object itself. A parallel implementation for a multiprocessor system is presented. The controller fully compensates for the system dynamics and directly controls the object internal forces. Most importantly, it presents a simple, powerful, intuitive interface to higher level strategic control modules.

The issues involved in the design of special-purpose VLSI processors are discussed, and an 8*8 2-D DCT/IDCT processor chip that can be used for high rate image and video coding is presented. A recently published algorithm for computing the DCT and its inverse is outlined. The processor architecture based on the algorithm is presented. Details of functional units and special circuits are discussed. The 8*8 2-D DCT/IDCT processor chip measures 7.9*9.2 mm/sup 2/. It is designed using the MOSIS 2 mu m scalable CMOS technology. It takes 16-b inputs. uses 16-b internal memory for coefficients and data, and generates 16-b outputs. A single input line determines if the chip computes the DCT or the IDCT. The chip is highly pipelined with a latency of 127 cycles and a maximum delay time of 18 ns between any two pipeline stages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.143413","startPage":"135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3850/00143413.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.143413","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCT/IDCT processor design for high data rate image coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"DCT/IDCT processor design for high data rate image coding","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4224157","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCT/IDCT processor design for high data rate image coding","sourcePdf":"00143413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04296S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"70","articleId":"143413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":143414,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This allows near-optimal performance in a mean square error sense while keeping the hardware complexity low. The encoder is partitioned into a slave processor chip that computes the distance and performs minimizations and an off-chip controller that directs the search. Pointer addressing is exploited in the codebook memory to keep the controller hardware simple. Inputs to the slave processor include the source vectors, the code vectors; and external control signals. The slave processor outputs the index of the code vector that best approximates the input in a mean square error sense. The layout for the slave processor has been generated using a 1.2- mu m CMOS library and measures 5.76*6.6 mm/sup 2/. Critical path simulation with SPICE indicates a throughput of 89 million multiply-accumulates per second.

They are suitable for concurrent decoding of multiple independent bit streams. The PLA-based architectures have greater flexibility and can take advantages of some high-level optimization techniques. The input/output rate can be fixed or variable to meet the application requirements. As an experiment, the authors have constructed a VLC based on a popular video compression system and compared the architectures.

Part I showed several architectural and architecture-specific optimization techniques. However, due to the recursion within the reconstruction algorithm, the achievable throughput rate for a given decoding architecture in a given IC technology is limited. The authors propose various concurrent decoding methods to relax the throughput limit by using parallel or pipelined hardware. These methods are simple, effective, flexible, and applicable to general decoder architectures. Unlimited concurrency can be achieved at the expense of additional latency, the overhead is low, and the complexity increases linearly with the throughput improvement. It is believed that the proposed methods and architectures make it possible to reconstruct arbitrarily high resolution Huffman-coded images and video in real time with current electronics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.143419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3850/00143419.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.143419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3850","startPage":"197","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing a high-throughput VLC decoder.

The approach is applied to the two-channel case and then extended to deal with arbitrary numbers of channels. The intention is to equalize not only the response of the loudspeakers and the listening room but also the crosstalk transmission from right loudspeaker to left ear and vice versa. The formulation is a generalization of the Atal-Schroeder crosstalk canceler. However, the use of a least-squares approach to the digital filter design and of appropriate modeling delays potentially allows the effective equalization of nonminimum phase components in the transmission path. A stochastic gradient algorithm which facilitates the adaptation of the digital filters to the optimal solution, thereby providing the possibility of designing the filters in situ, is presented. Some experimental results for the two-channel case are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive inverse filters for stereophonic sound reproduction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.143434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3851/00143434.pdf","startPage":"1621","endPage":"1632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.143434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive inverse filters for stereophonic sound reproduction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4242822","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive inverse filters for stereophonic sound reproduction","sourcePdf":"00143434.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044786S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"78","articleId":"143434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":143435,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

However, for an M-stage pipeline, the result of a given operation is available only M clock periods after initiating the computation. In a recursive filter, the computation of y(n) cannot be initiated before the computations of y(n-1) through y(n-N) are completed. H.B. Voelcker and E.E. Hartquist (1970) and P.M.Kogge and H.S. Stone (1973) independently devised augmentation techniques for resolving the dependence problem in the computation of y(n). However, the augmentation required to ensure stability may be excessively high, resulting in a very complex numerator realization. A technique which results in a minimum order augmentation is presented. The complexity of the resulting filter design is very much lower. Various pipelining architectures are presented. It is demonstrated by an example that when compared to the prototype filter, the augmented filter has a lower coefficient sensitivity and better roundoff noise performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.143436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3851/00143436.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.143436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3851","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined recursive filter with minimum order augmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined recursive filter with minimum order augmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4242824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined recursive filter with minimum order augmentation","sourcePdf":"00143436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028552S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","articleId":"143436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":143437,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

Basic adaptive filtering algorithms give poor convergence performance when the input to the adaptive system is colored. More sophisticated algorithms which converge very rapidly regardless of the input spectrum algorithms typically require O(N/sup 2/) computation, where N is the order of the adaptive filter, a significant disadvantage for real-time applications. Also, many of these algorithms behave poorly in finite-precision implementation. An adaptive filtering algorithm is introduced which employs a quasi-Newton approach to give rapid convergence even with colored inputs.

Initially, the input bandpass signal is mixed to a carrier frequency that is one-fourth of the sampling rate of a single A/D converter. The digitized bandpass signal is converted into its I and Q components at one-half the A/D sample rate by a digital product detector (DPD) composed of a commutator, two sign alternators, and two FIR fractional-phase interpolator filters. This simple structure can yield image performance that is limited by A/D quantization using relatively low interpolator filter orders and IF bandwidths as large as one-half the sampling rate of the A/D converter. The DPD performs Nyquist limit demodulation of the sampled bandpass signal and, therefore, requires a minimal sampling rate. The theory of operation, an analytic proof, design methodology, and simulated performance results are presented. Simulated results show that -86 dB images can be obtained with 8-tap FIR interpolators and a 12 bit A/D converter.

These estimators are closely related to IF estimation via the (periodic) first moment, with respect to frequency of discrete time-frequency representations (TFRs) in L. Cohen's (1966) class. The authors determine the distribution of this class of estimators and establish a framework which allows the comparison of several other estimators such as the zero-crossing estimator and one based on linear regression on the signal phase. It is found that the regression IF estimator is biased and exhibits a large threshold for much of the frequency range.

The authors analyze some specific properties of this GTFR and compare them to other TFRs. Asymptotically, the GTFR is shown to produce results identical to that of the spectrogram for stationary signals. Interference terms normally present in many GTFRs are shown to be attenuated drastically by the use of the ZAM-GTFR. The ability of the ZAM-GTFR to track frequency hopping is shown to be close to that of the Wigner distribution. When a signal is subjected to white noise, the ZAM-GTFR produces an unbiased estimate of the ZAM-GTFR of the signal without noise. In many other GTFRs, the power spectral density of the noise is superimposed on the GTFR of the signal. It is also shown that, in discrete form, the ZAM-GTFR is generally invertible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3851/00143445.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.143445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.143445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some properties of the generalized time frequency representation with cone-shaped kernel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Kernel","Spectrogram","Signal resolution","Chirp","Displays","Interference suppression","White noise","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","signal processing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hopping tracking","signal processing","generalized time frequency representation","cone-shaped kernel","stationary signals","white noise","unbiased estimate","power spectral density","discrete form"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Some properties of the generalized time frequency representation with cone-shaped kernel","volume":"40","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4242833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some properties of the generalized time frequency representation with cone-shaped kernel","sourcePdf":"00143445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046629S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","articleId":"143445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":143446,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Time-scale analysis has been introduced recently as a powerful tool through linear representations called (continuous) wavelet transforms (WTs), a concept for which an exhaustive bilinear generalization is given. Although time scale is presented as an alternative method to time frequency, strong links relating the two are emphasized, thus combining both descriptions into a unified perspective. The authors provide a full characterization of the new class: the result is expressed as an affine smoothing of the Wigner-Ville distribution, on which interesting properties may be further imposed through proper choices of the smoothing function parameters. Not only do specific choices allow recovery of known definitions, but they also provide, via separable smoothing, a continuous transition from Wigner-Ville to either spectrograms or scalograms (squared modulus of the WT). This property makes time-scale representations a very flexible tool for nonstationary signal analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.143446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3851/00143446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.143446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3851","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-scale energy distributions: a general class extending wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=143446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-scale energy distributions: a general class extending wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4242834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-scale energy distributions: a general class extending wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00143446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045909S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"241","articleId":"143446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":143447,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The performance of the MUSIC algorithm is examined for situations in which the noise covariance and array response are perturbed from their assumed values. Theoretical expressions for the error in the MUSIC DOA estimates are derived and compared with simulations performed for several representative cases, and with the appropriate Cramer-Rao bound.

By exploiting cyclostationarity, i.e. evaluating the cyclic correlations of the received data at certain cycle frequencies, one can extract the cyclic correlations of only signals with the same cycle frequency and null out the cyclic correlations of stationary additive noise and all other cochannel interferences with different cycle frequencies. Thus, the signal detection capability can be significantly improved. An approach for exploiting cyclostationarity that is asymptotically exact for either narrowband or broadband sources, unlike previous methods, is proposed. The method also has significant implementational advantages over the earlier techniques.

Four neural networks were investigated regarding their potential to fuse data from an ultrasonic and an infrared range finder to yield more accurate estimates of depth. A radial basis predicter using localized receptive fields (LRF) was able to learn mappings quickly. However, it failed to locate receptive fields correctly within the input space thus providing a poorer mapping than a backpropagation network. A variation on LRF incorporating dynamic node creation was able to learn good mappings in about the same amount of time as a backprop network while exploring different network sizes. An output encoding scheme produced the best performance by exhibiting less error at places where the depth functions that varied rapidly. The resulting network provides a cost-effective solution to range estimation for autonomous navigation using on-board hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1990.143650","pdfPath":"/iel2/314/3854/00143650.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"815","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing 1990","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing 1990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1990.143650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensor fusion using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/143650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor fusion using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4067508","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor fusion using neural networks","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00143650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083743S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"314","citationCount":"2","articleId":"143650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":143652,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

The goal was to define an electrocardiographic (ECG) database for assessing the quality of ambulatory ECG monitoring (AECG) systems. Thirteen research groups from 8 countries continued providing AEGG tapes and annotating beat-by-beat the selected 2-channel records, each 2 hours in duration. ST segment and T-wave changes were identified and their onset, offset and peak beats annotated in addition to QRSs, beat types, rhythm and signal quality changes. The first set of 50 records was completed and stored on compact-disk ROM. It includes more than 200 ST segment and almost 300 T-wave changes. In cooperation with the developers of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Boston's Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) arrhythmia database, the annotation scheme was devised to be consistent with both MIT-BIH and American Heart Association (AHA) formats.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1990.144191","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel2/359/3861/00144191.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1990.144191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The European ST-T database: development, distribution and use","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144191/","displayDocTitle":"The European ST-T database: development, distribution and use","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4112310","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The European ST-T database: development, distribution and use","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00144191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038842S","chronDate":"23-26 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"359","citationCount":"28","articleId":"144191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":144205,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

While during the training phase multisensor signals and catheterized verifications of heart failures have been utilized, the PC-based diagnostic system analyzes heart sound signals quasi-on-line in a way similar to how physicians perform their subjective learning and interpretation of stethoscopic signals. The systolic and diastolic time intervals of healthy probands as well as patients with heart failures estimated by the neural network were found to be in excellent correspondence with measurements. Also, the sound pattern recognition results demonstrate the high accuracy, though training and test sets were based on different sources.

Unfortunately, this strategy appears to cause the model to lose its ability to discriminate between normal/abnormal QRS complexes.

The EST network provided 106/125 correct interpretations. It is concluded that the functional success on software simulated neural networks is derived from the underlying computing model. Input values are comparable to multidimensional vectors since they are sequences of values wherein value position in the sequence is as important as the value itself. Interneural connections are numerical matrices instead. Network knowledge is included in the matrices that define each particular network.

In Gobbledoc, image processing, document analysis, and OCR operations take place in batch mode when the documents are acquired. The document image acquisition process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.144436","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/3864/00144436.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.144436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3864","startPage":"10","endPage":"22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prototype document image analysis system for technical journals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A prototype document image analysis system for technical journals","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4245335","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prototype document image analysis system for technical journals","sourcePdf":"00144436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046366S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"220","articleId":"144436","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":144441,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The system uses a recognition-based segmenter, that is a hybrid of connected-components analysis (CCA), vertical cuts, and a neural network recognizer. Connected components that are single digits are handled by CCA. CCs that are combined or dissected digits are handled by the vertical-cut segmenter. The four main stages of processing are preprocessing, in which noise is removed and the digits are deslanted, CCA segmentation and recognition, vertical-cut-point estimation and segmentation, and directly lookup. The system was trained and tested on approximately 10000 images, five- and nine-digit ZIP code fields taken from real mail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Pattern recognition","Research and development","Image processing","Laboratories","Character recognition","Image recognition","Information systems","Man machine systems","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","computerised pattern recognition","computerised picture processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten digits reading","ZIP code recognition system","neural network algorithm-based system","recognition-based segmenter","connected-components analysis","vertical cuts","neural network recognizer","vertical-cut-point estimation","directly lookup"]}],"publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/3864/00144441.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.144441","doi":"10.1109/2.144441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reading handwritten digits: a ZIP code recognition system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144441/","displayDocTitle":"Reading handwritten digits: a ZIP code recognition system","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4245340","volume":"25","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reading handwritten digits: a ZIP code recognition system","sourcePdf":"00144441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040057S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"24","articleId":"144441","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":144475,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The conversion efficiency of such waveguides can be significantly enhanced by using a distributed out-coupling via a nonresonant first-order corrugation. Analysis of the proposed device is carried out using a coupled-mode approach. The results indicate that in certain cases, the second harmonic generation may be enhanced up to few orders of magnitude. The proposed scheme appears to be efficient mainly in phase-matched situations with moderate harmonic loss (up to about 100 cm/sup -1/).

The displacements are usually time varying and can severely degrade the performance of the beamformer. This problem is approached by restoring the sensor output signals before beamforming by adaptively tracking and compensating for the displacements. This approach does not require modifications of the conventional shipboard beamformer and hence can be used cost-effectively to upgrade existing conventional systems. Two adaptive algorithms are used for two different cases: known sensor moving trajectories and unknown trajectories with relatively small displacements compared with the intersensor spacing. Tracking performance of the algorithms is analyzed. Simulation results show that for known sensor trajectories the algorithm significantly improves the performance of the conventional shipboard beamformer whereas only limited improvement can be achieved when the trajectories are unknown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144559/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","volume":"28","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4231718","publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of conventional beamforming with hydrophone array of varying geometry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of conventional beamforming with hydrophone array of varying geometry","sourcePdf":"00144559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058655S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"2","articleId":"144559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":144570,"authors":[{"name":"W.-T.

Errors in array element positions as a result of structural distortions are considered as deterministic and predictable. Detailed calculations for two assumed modes of distortion reveal that their effects on antenna performance are the loss of peak response in the scan direction and the broadening of the mainlobe, while the far-out sidelobe structure remains relatively intact. For large antennas, performance improvement can be expected by suitable phase compensation. Performance of antennas with random errors in their element positions must be treated statistically. Expressions of average directivity and sidelobe level corresponding to arbitrary error magnitudes in element position, amplitude and phase of excitation as well as finite rate of failure of element modules were derived and verified by direct numerical calculations from the antenna directivity patterns. For a planar phased-array antenna typical for space-based radars, the standard deviation of element position errors must not exceed 1% of the operating wavelength in order to maintain a -10 dBi sidelobe level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4236291","displayDocTitle":"Performance of phased-array antennas with mechanical errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of phased-array antennas with mechanical errors","sourcePdf":"00144579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042731S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"64","articleId":"144579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":144580,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The algorithm uses a sliding window of length uT (T is the sampling time) to keep the measurement sequence at time k. Instead of solving a large problem, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into several clusters so that a number of smaller problems are solved independently. When a set of measurements is received, a new set of data-association hypotheses is formed for all the measurements lying in the validation gates within each cluster from time K-u+1 to K. The probability of each track history is computed, and, choosing the largest of these histories, the target measurement is updated with an adaptive state estimator. A covariance-matching technique is used to improve the accuracy of the adaptive state estimator. In several examples, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.144580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/3868/00144580.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"559","doi":"10.1109/7.144580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking multitarget in cluttered environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"Tracking multitarget in cluttered environment","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1992","accessionNumber":"4236292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking multitarget in cluttered environment","sourcePdf":"00144580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033556S","chronDate":"Apr 1992","isNumber":"3868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"1","articleId":"144580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":144581,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Rokhlin (1990) to efficiently solve acoustic scattering problems is modified and adapted to the second-kind-integral-equation formulation of electromagnetic scattering problems in two dimensions. The present implementation treats the exterior Dirichlet problem for two-dimensional, closed, conducting objects of arbitrary geometry. The FMM reduces the operation count for solving the second-kind integral equation from O(n/sup 3/) for Gaussian elimination to O(n/sup 4/3/) per conjugate-gradient iteration, where n is the number of sample points on the boundary of the scatterer. A sample technique for accelerating convergence of the iterative method, termed complexifying k, the wavenumber, is also presented. This has the effect of bounding the condition number of the discrete system; consequently, the operation count of the entire FMM (all iterations) becomes O(n/sup 4/3/). Computational results for moderate values of ka, where a is the characteristic size of the scatterer, are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3869/00144597.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.144597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.144597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fast multipole method (FMM) for electromagnetic scattering problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","Acoustic scattering","Integral equations","Iterative methods","Poisson equations","Geometry","Acceleration","Convergence","Physics","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","integral equations","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-D problems","operation count reduction","fast multipole method","electromagnetic scattering","second-kind-integral-equation formulation","exterior Dirichlet problem","conducting objects","arbitrary geometry","FMM","conjugate-gradient iteration","convergence","complexifying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"The fast multipole method (FMM) for electromagnetic scattering problems","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4231663","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fast multipole method (FMM) for electromagnetic scattering problems","sourcePdf":"00144597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029622S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"297","articleId":"144597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":144599,"authors":[{"name":"C.-F.

The architecture of these n*n switches, particularly their internal buffers, is critical for achieving high-throughput low-latency communication with cost-effective implementations. Several buffer structures are discussed and compared in terms of implementation complexity, inter-switch handshaking requirements, and their ability to deal with variations in traffic patterns and message lengths. A design for buffers that provide non-FIFO message handling and efficient storage allocation for variable size packets using linked lists managed by a simple on-chip controller is presented. The new buffer design is evaluated by comparing it to several alternative designs in the context of a multistage interconnection network. The modeling and simulation show that the new buffer outperforms alternative buffers and can thus be used to improve the performance of a wide variety of systems currently using less efficient buffers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically-allocated multi-queue buffers for VLSI communication switches","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.144624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/3870/00144624.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.144624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically-allocated multi-queue buffers for VLSI communication switches","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4226492","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically-allocated multi-queue buffers for VLSI communication switches","sourcePdf":"00144624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048871S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"138","articleId":"144624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":144628,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Bokhari (IEEE Trans. Comput., vol.37, p.48-57, 1988) has studied the assignment of the modules of a parallel program to the processors of a multiple-computer system. He proposed algorithms to solve optimally the following problems: (1) partition chain-structured parallel or pipelined programs over chain-connected systems; (2) partition multiple chain-structured parallel or pipelined programs over single-host multiple satellite systems; (3) partition multiple arbitrarily structured serial programs over single-host multiple-satellite systems; (4) partition single-tree structured parallel or pipelined programs over single-host multiple identical satellite systems. The authors solve here problem 1 by dynamic programming and problem 2 by sorting and using bisection search for the bottleneck value.

This approach is generalized and results are obtained about the parameters of a class of subfield subcodes of geometric Goppa codes; in other words, the covering radii are estimated, and further, the number of information symbols whenever the minimum distance is small in relation to the length of the code is found.

For the class of linear estimator-based decoders, necessary conditions for optimality for the encoder, decoder and modulation signal set are derived. An algorithm that iteratively solves these necessary conditions to converge to a locally optimum solution has been developed. By studying the performance of the previous class of digital communication systems in the limit of infinite encoding rates, it is demonstrated that the MSE of a bandwidth and energy constrained digital system is bounded from below by that of a block pulse amplitude modulation system. This bound is readily computable in terms of the eigenvalues of the source and channel covariance matrices. The results indicate that for a correlated source, a sufficiently noisy channel and specific source block sizes and bandwidths, the digital system performance coincides with the optimum performance theoretically attainable. Further, significant performance improvements over the standard VQ-based system are demonstrated when the channel is noisy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.144704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3873/00144704.pdf","startPage":"1230","endPage":"1248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.144704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of block source codes and modulation signal sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144704/","displayDocTitle":"Joint design of block source codes and modulation signal sets","volume":"38","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4256401","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint design of block source codes and modulation signal sets","sourcePdf":"00144704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110369S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"72","articleId":"144704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":144705,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Context-free grammars are used to categorize the ways in which nodes branch to yield daughter nodes, thus providing an organized setting to examine the entropies for random branching processes whose realizations are trees and whose probabilities are determined by probabilities associated with the substitution rules of the grammar. Normalized entropy rates H are derived for the critical branching rate and supercritical branching rate processes. An equipartition theorem is proved for the supercritical processes. A strong departure from classical theorems for Markov sources occurs for supercritical branching processes as the typical sets have supergeometric growth rates. The combinatorics of the set of all trees that can be generated from the context-free substitution rules is also studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4256406","displayDocTitle":"Entropies and combinatorics of random branching processes and context-free languages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropies and combinatorics of random branching processes and context-free languages","sourcePdf":"00144710.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049082S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","articleId":"144710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":144714,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

For the same error-correcting capability, the loss in code rate incurred by a multiple-error correcting (d,k) code resulting from this scheme is no greater than that incurred by the parent linear block code.

In the DTEST GEN system, delay testing problems are divided into gross delay faults and small delay faults separately so that the tradeoff between the levels of delay testing effort and the confidence levels of proper system operation can be explored. Complete automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) algorithms are proposed for both gross delay faults and small delay faults. A novel timing analysis method for delay test generation which uses a conventional depth-first search technique and a novel functionality analysis technique is introduced. The functionality analysis technique examines, necessary conditions for a given delay fault to be testable and estimates the upper bound of the good circuit propagation delay of the longest sensitizable path passing through the fault site. Several benchmark results are demonstrated for both gross delay fault testing and small delay fault testing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.144857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.144857","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3879/00144857.pdf","startPage":"926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient delay test generation system for combinational logic circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144857/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient delay test generation system for combinational logic circuits","volume":"11","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4225610","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient delay test generation system for combinational logic circuits","sourcePdf":"00144857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044997S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"26","articleId":"144857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":144884,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The transmission times of the users are governed by protocol signals. The authors consider the model of a slot-synchronized collision channel without feedback, proposed by J.L. Massey and P. Mathys (1985), augmented by interleavers that are essential for enabling the use of practical short codes. They assess the throughput of the channel on the basis of a short-coding error parameter. The set of parameters of all users characterizes the rate region achievable by employing short block codes with nonideal interleaving. The short-coding error parameter corresponds to a bound on the probability of error which is tighter than the bound expressed with the aid of the conventional cut-off rate. The analysis takes into account practical communication aspects, such as the effect of interleaving span and noise in noninterfered slots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedforward multiple access satellite communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.144886","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3881/00144886.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.144886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=144886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/144886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward multiple access satellite communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4225851","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward multiple access satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00144886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0523S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"3881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","articleId":"144886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":144890,"authors":[{"name":"N.

For a uniform plasma the local conduction currents to the water surface integrate to zero over the RF period, and the surface charging is sufficient to damage oxides. For the case of thin oxides under a gate exposed to a nonuniform magnetron plasma, the gate surface can charge up until the oxide tunneling current balances the difference in the mean local conduction currents from the plasma. It is this oxide current that leads to degradation. The oxide current obtained via SPICE circuit simulations, probe measurements and breakdown measurements shows good agreement with experimental damage data of 'antenna' capacitors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.145080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/3888/00145080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.145080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3888","startPage":"347","endPage":"349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model and experiments for thin oxide damage from wafer charging in magnetron plasmas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=145080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A model and experiments for thin oxide damage from wafer charging in magnetron plasmas","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1992","accessionNumber":"4196210","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model and experiments for thin oxide damage from wafer charging in magnetron plasmas","sourcePdf":"00145080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045658S","chronDate":"June  1992","isNumber":"3888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"73","articleId":"145080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":145136,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The authors present a technique to lock a Fabry-Perot etalon on an atomic reference to provide multiple and evenly spaced absolute frequency references. Absolute etalon spacing is calibrated by matching two atomic references with two corresponding etalon modes. To maintain long-term stability in channel spacing, the etalon is locked to an atomic resonance using an electrical feedback loop to control mirror separation. This technique can be used for close spacing or coherent applications where channel separation and reproducibility is critical between transmitter and receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3896/00145277.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.145277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.145277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=145277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibrated Fabry-Perot etalon as an absolute frequency reference for OFDM communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabry-Perot","Frequency","Atomic beams","Laser applications","Laser stability","OFDM","Channel spacing","Resonance","Feedback loop","Mirrors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","frequency division multiplexing","frequency measurement","laser frequency stability","laser variables measurement","light interferometers","optical links","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibrated Fabry Perot etalon","optical FDM","absolute etalon spacing","absolute frequency reference","OFDM communications","frequency locking","lasers","atomic reference","etalon modes","long-term stability","channel spacing","atomic resonance","electrical feedback loop","mirror separation","close spacing","coherent applications","reproducibility","transmitter","receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Calibrated Fabry-Perot etalon as an absolute frequency reference for OFDM communications","volume":"4","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4242463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibrated Fabry-Perot etalon as an absolute frequency reference for OFDM communications","sourcePdf":"00145277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033998S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"24","articleId":"145277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":145279,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

Rapid iterative convergence, negligible false recognitions, and robustness are additional properties of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.145294","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.145294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3897","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/3897/00145294.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using polynomic embedding for neural network design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145294/","displayDocTitle":"Using polynomic embedding for neural network design","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4263128","publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using polynomic embedding for neural network design","sourcePdf":"00145294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07856S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"145294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":145297,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The incremental computation technique is used to obtain efficient parallel (or block) implementations.

It derives its architecture mainly from a systolic design for 1-D rank order filtering proposed previously. The adopted systolic design, called the sample oriented rank order filter design, takes advantage of the evaluated rank values in the current window for the evaluation of the rank values in the next window without explicitly sorting the data in the window. This makes it possible to convert a 2-D windowed data sequence into a 1-D windowed data sequence with multiple data sample exchange at each window movement, and the 1-D systolic design is thus applicable. By cascading many such 1-D systolic arrays into a 2-D array, and supplied with simple parallel-in-serial-out (PISO) logic, this architecture can achieve the maximally available parallelism with nearly 100% efficiency if either the pipeline interleaving or processor sharing technique is used. The design does not require the preloading of the whole 2-D data array, and line scanned images can be processed with negligible time delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4038318","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Systolic architecture for 2-D rank order filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic architecture for 2-D rank order filtering","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00145446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057479S","chronDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"486","citationCount":"15","articleId":"145446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":145461,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For some applications bit-serial architectures may be too slow, and bit-parallel architectures may be faster than necessary and may require too much hardware. The desired sample rate can be achieved using the digit-serial approach, where multiple bits of a sample are processed in a single clock cycle. The number of bits processed in one clock cycle in the digit-serial systems is the digit size; the digit size can be any arbitrary integer. A digit-serial implementation of two's complement adders and multipliers is presented. Unfolding of multiple-rate operations (such as interpolators and decimators) is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145471/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4045300","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digit-serial DSP architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digit-serial DSP architectures","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00145471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032563S","chronDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"486","citationCount":"17","articleId":"145471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":145472,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It appears to be a viable architecture for low-level vision processing. The processors operate in SIMD model at 20 MHz. To avoid high speed transfer of analog data, an A/D converter in the form of a linear array of comparators is used. The architecture of the processing part conforms to the row parallel output from the A/D-converters. A simple but efficient processor excellently suited to the special VLSI constraints of the sensor was designed. The pitch in the present version of PASIC is 30 mu m and it was possible to fit the A/D-converter circuitry, the shift register, the ALU, and the memory into this narrow slot. A key factor is the unified structure achieved by extending the memory data bus to all other units within the same column. The versatility of the chip is shown using three algorithms: edge detection, shading correction, and histogram-based thresholding. Each is executed in approximately 10 ms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1990.145472","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/486/3901/00145472.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1990.145472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PASIC.

The matrices to which the plane Jacobi rotations are applied are decomposed into even and odd parts, enabling the application of the rotations from a single side and thus removing some sequentiality from the original method. The rotations are evaluated and applied in a fully concurrent fashion with the help of an implicit CORDIC algorithm. In addition, the CORDIC algorithm can perform rotations with variable resolution, which lead to a significant reduction in the total computation time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1990.145511","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1990.145511","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/486/3901/00145511.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"781","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-level systolic algorithm for the symmetric eigenvalue problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-level systolic algorithm for the symmetric eigenvalue problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4045336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-level systolic algorithm for the symmetric eigenvalue problem","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00145511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033228S","chronDate":"5-7 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"486","citationCount":"5","articleId":"145511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":145531,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The problems associated with high radices are efficiently solved by the use of a redundant representation of intermediate operands.

The novel circuits are faster and use less hardware than existing similar circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1991.145540","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings 10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings 10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/488/3902/00145540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1991.145540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3902","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of residue generators and multioperand modular adders using carry-save adders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=145540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of residue generators and multioperand modular adders using carry-save adders","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145540/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4060524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of residue generators and multioperand modular adders using carry-save adders","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"00145540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045068S","chronDate":"26-28 Jun 1991","isNumber":"3902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"488","citationCount":"22","articleId":"145540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":145548,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

An outline of the language features and how they can be used is also provided, to help justify the particular choice of coprocessor specifications.

In SOI (silicon-on-insulator) devices, the silicon layer sits on an oxide layer of typically 400 nm. It is proposed that a thin, gate-quality oxide can be realized at the front as well as the back of the devices, which should greatly enhance the radiation hardness. Double-gate devices (i.e. the same gate at the front and the back of the device) have been shown to have, at least theoretically, interesting short-channel and high transconductance properties. The only reported realization of such a device used a complicated, highly non-planar process (vertical devices) and left one edge of the device in contact with a thick oxide, which can be detrimental to rad-hard performances.

Pulse-induced-noises due to the wiring inductance of measurement systems screens intrinsic AC effects. After precautions against noises, AC hot-carrier degradation can be estimated in LDD on the basis of DC measurements. The noise is negligible for degradation when the wiring inductance is smaller than 250 m Omega . In terms of device structure dependence, for SD and LDD, enhanced AC degradation was observed during channel hot-electron (CHE) stress. No acceleration occurred with drain avalanche hot-carrier (DAHC). In LDD, this enhancement can be attributed to stronger DAHC stress during gate pulse transients, while in SD, trapping of channel hot electrons at neutral traps created at the rising and the falling edges of gate pulses acted as an additional acceleration factor. In the case of GOLD, however, no difference between AC and DC stress was seen for DAHC or CHE conditions, and CHE stress was more severe than DAHC stress, which was possibly due to a large gate current characteristic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AC hot-carrier effects in scaled MOS devices","publicationTitle":"29th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1991","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.1991.145999","displayPublicationTitle":"29th Annual Proceedings Reliability Physics 1991","pdfPath":"/iel2/530/3908/00145999.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1991.145999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3908","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=145999","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/145999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 1991","displayDocTitle":"AC hot-carrier effects in scaled MOS devices","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4067451","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AC hot-carrier effects in scaled MOS devices","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"00145999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03281S","chronDate":"9-11 April 1991","isNumber":"3908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"530","citationCount":"19","articleId":"145999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":146011,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The mechanism has been interpreted to be due to an increase in the interface state density, while its dependence on stress time has been found to be proportional to t/sup n/, where n is 0.5 to 1. It was expected that if the stress time was long enough, the increase in interface state density would saturate to a maximum value. However, an anomalous time dependence of base current increase-a slower increase initially followed by a rapid increase in the intermediate stage-was found for bipolar transistors whose junction surface was oxidized in dry ambient conditions.

High resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements indicate that two dimensional nanometric oxide ridges are formed at the interface.

The nondissipative snubber completely eliminates the voltage overshoot and ringing across the rectifiers. The ringing of the parasitic capacitance of the rectifiers and the leakage inductance of the transformer are eliminated in a nondissipative manner, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the circuit. The active snubber employs only a high-voltage low-power MOSFET and a high-voltage capacitor. The control of the snubber switch is simple and utilizes the PWM signal to control the primary switches with a time delay. The authors also present the complete steady-state analysis of the ZVS-FB-PWM converter employing the active snubber. The analysis shows that the transformer secondary voltage is a function of the steady-state duty cycle and gives the equation to calculate the steady-state secondary voltage.

Controller parts count is minimized using a custom VLSI chip which performs the rotor position sensing, pulse-width-modulated (PWM) current regulation, and various protection functions.

Two valid approaches to realize three-phase power supplies can be proposed. In the first approach, current regulated pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverters along with high bandwidth voltage control loops are proposed. In the second approach, an internal voltage synthesizer under closed loop current control is used. Both approaches have mechanisms to decouple the LC filter interactions and to lower the THD. The tradeoffs of these two basic approaches are investigated. The influence of different current regulators in case of the current-regulated PWM (CRPWM) converter is investigated as well as different approaches to control the voltage synthesizer under current control. The study compares the effectiveness of these current regulator in soft-switching PWM inverters and describes a method to measure accurately ultra-low THDs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1991.146242","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '91: Sixth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] APEC '91: Sixth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel2/547/3910/00146242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1991.146242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3910","startPage":"622","endPage":"629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of three phase power supplies for ultra low THD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=146242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of three phase power supplies for ultra low THD","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/146242/","conferenceDate":"10-15 March 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4136756","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of three phase power supplies for ultra low THD","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00146242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037454S","chronDate":"10-15 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"547","citationCount":"32","articleId":"146242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":146301,"authors":[{"name":"D.-L.

At such high speed, distributing clock signals across the system and making sure every component in the system is synchronized become very important issues. It is shown that one way to solve the inter-chip clock synchronization problem is to use an on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) for clock generation. The PLL can generate an on-chip clock that is phase-locked to the off-chip clock. Since the buffer to the PLL is lightly loaded, the delay through it is much smaller than the delay through a conventional clock buffer. As a result, inter-chip clock skew is substantially reduced. The functional blocks of a PLL clock generator, including phase detectors, charge pumps, loop filters, and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are described. Frequency synthesis in VCO-based PLLs and problems associated with designing and simulating PLLs are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/101.146301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/101/3912/00146301.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/101.146301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing on-chip clock generators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/146301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Designing on-chip clock generators","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4246367","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing on-chip clock generators","sourcePdf":"00146301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041122S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"101","citationCount":"16","articleId":"146301","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":146320,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

It is shown that the impact of an overlay defect is, on average, much higher than that of a regular defect, that boundary conditions and allocation management are the major causes of overlay defects, not timing, and that most overlays are small and corrupt data near the data that the programmer meant to update.

The design, which provides a way of detecting faults and correcting errors in RAMs within milliseconds while concurrently performing normal execution of programs, is reviewed. The approach is to add two parity bits to each row in the storage arrays of the RAM chips and to provide hardware scrubbing interleaved with normal program cycles. The RAM and MIBB (memory interface building block) chip designs, and some of the augmentations and changes required from the original conceptual design, are examined. The approach has been determined to be feasible, and the three-year design process has also demonstrated the large distance between a conceptual design and its realization. Errors and deficiencies were found in the original design and corrected, and new useful functions were identified and added.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Digest of Papers.

The construction is modified in two ways: (1) to obtain b-bED/s-UED codes in which a random burst of length b and up to s unidirectional errors are detected, and (2) to obtain b-bED/s-UbED codes in which a random burst of length b and a unidirectional burst of length s are detected.

The framework is based on a clear separation of the mission and critical issues during requirements analysis. Analysis of the critical issues is performed in two phases. The first phase identifies those real world properties relevant to the critical requirements: the physical laws or rules of operation, and the system hazards. In the second phase, the interface between the system and its environment is identified, and the behavior required at this interface is specified. The utilization of different formal models, namely, a logical formalism (timed history logic) and a net formalism (predicate-transition nets), respectively, is proposed for the two phases. To illustrate the framework, an example based on a train set crossing is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/146704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4031287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The role of formal methods in the requirements analysis of safety-critical systems: a train set example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of formal methods in the requirements analysis of safety-critical systems: a train set example","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00146704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02745S","chronDate":"25-27 June 1991","isNumber":"3916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"341","citationCount":"6","articleId":"146704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":146746,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Superconducting realizations of this class of filters may be used to replace bulkier, heavier filters currently used for satellite communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniature dual mode microstrip filters","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1991.147031","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/507/3918/00147031.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"446 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1991.147031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=147031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"Miniature dual mode microstrip filters","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4081858","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniature dual mode microstrip filters","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041747S","chronDate":"10-14 July 1991","isNumber":"3918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"507","citationCount":"126","articleId":"147031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":147037,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Numerical results are given for shielded and suspended coupled dielectric waveguides.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/507/3918/00147093.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"677 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1991.147093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1991.147093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=147093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved TLM full-wave analysis using a two dimensional mesh","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Resonant frequency","Transmission lines","Couplings","Dielectrics","Transmission line matrix methods","Arm","Laboratories","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric waveguides","dispersion (wave)","electronic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shielded waveguides","TLM full-wave analysis","two dimensional mesh","transmission line mesh","dispersive guided structures","CPU time","memory space","arbitrarily shaped guided structures","suspended coupled dielectric waveguides"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"An improved TLM full-wave analysis using a two dimensional mesh","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4081888","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved TLM full-wave analysis using a two dimensional mesh","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066867S","chronDate":"10-14 July 1991","isNumber":"3918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"507","citationCount":"15","articleId":"147093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":147111,"authors":[{"name":"W.P.

This is the best reported performance of a W-band monolithic LNA. The measured results of this MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) LNA rival those of some reported hybrid LNAs. A rigorous analysis procedure was incorporated in the design, including accurate active device modeling and full-wave EM analysis of passive structures. The first-pass success of this LNA chip design indicates the importance of a rigorous analysis/design methodology in the millimeter-wave monolithic IC development.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1991.147164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3918","startPage":"943","endPage":"946 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/507/3918/00147164.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance W-band monolithic pseudomorphic InGaAs HEMT LNA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 July 1991","displayDocTitle":"A high performance W-band monolithic pseudomorphic InGaAs HEMT LNA","conferenceDate":"10-14 July 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4081900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high performance W-band monolithic pseudomorphic InGaAs HEMT LNA","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065218S","chronDate":"10-14 July 1991","isNumber":"3918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"507","citationCount":"16","articleId":"147164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":147182,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Moreover, fast packet switching capabilities are assumed on-board the satellite. Alternatives for the architecture of the on-board fast packet switching fabric are considered. The performance of the considered approaches has been derived by theoretical analysis and computer simulations. A novel input queuing technique is also proposed and analyzed to show that it achieves better performance with respect to the classical input queuing approach.

In many applications, if a source transmits a packet to a destination in a frame, it is highly probable that it will also transmit another packet to the same destination in the next frame. So it is not necessary to schedule incoming packets for every frame if all the switching patterns for the nearest scheduled frame can be preserved and the patterns updated appropriately according to changes in traffic demand. An adaptive algorithm of a lower time complexity which assigns time slots to packets according to the changes in traffic demands is given. This algorithm has the worst case time complexity O(N/sup 2/L), where L is the TDM frame length and N is the switch size. Simulation results show that the algorithm is efficient for interdependent traffic and for random traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive scheduling algorithm for TDM switching systems (satellite communications and terrestrial networks)","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFCOM '91.

Cost functions are presented that are appropriate for the most common applications. Scheduling and dropping algorithms are defined based on these cost functions.

The algorithm first constructs a planar triangulation from locations of all nodes as a starting topology. Then, the minimum angles of all triangles in the planar triangulation are maximized by means of edge switching to improve connectivity and throughput. The resulting Delaunay triangulation can be determined locally at each node. The topology is modified by negotiating among neighbors to satisfy a design requirement on the nodal degree parameter. Simulations show that (1) the final topology is degree-bounded, (2) it has a rather regular and uniform structure, and (3) its throughput and reliability are greater than that of a number of alternative topologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1991.147624","startPage":"1084","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFCOM '91.

By utilizing the zero-drift condition as an input-output balance condition, the formidable tasks of specifying the channel load lines and equilibrium contours are avoided in this approach when assessing the stability performance of a persistent CSMA/CD system.

The graph model leads to a simple expression for the effective load on an arbitrary LAN segment, which takes into account the overhead traffic due to the learning mechanism of the transparent bridges. Simplifying assumptions for the operation of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol lead to a simple expression of the average end-to-end delay in terms of the effective loads on the LAN segments. The problem of optimally locating bridges and repeaters on the nodes in order to minimize the average delay is studied. This problem is equivalent to the set partitioning problem which can be readily solved with state-of-the-art algorithms. Minimizing cost subject to a constraint on average end-to-end delay is discussed.

Using data recorded by a monitor for several hundred million Ethernet packets, an overview of the short-range time correlations in external LAN traffic is presented. The analysis shows that LAN traffic is extremely bursty across time domains spanning six orders of magnitude. This behavior is compared with simple formal traffic models. The results suggest that the pronounced short-term traffic correlations, together with the extensive time regime of traffic burstiness, strongly influence the patterns of loss and delay induced by LAN interconnection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147663/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4081789","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High time-resolution measurement and analysis of LAN traffic: Implications for LAN interconnection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High time-resolution measurement and analysis of LAN traffic: Implications for LAN interconnection","confLoc":"Bal Harbour, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00147663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025629S","chronDate":"7-11 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"535","citationCount":"112","articleId":"147663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":147690,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Convergence times under 30 mu s are obtainable with general-purpose operational amplifiers for the processing nodes or neurons. Enhancements are possible with an artificial neural network system such as multiple target detection with a simple hardware addition to the basic system. Approximation of the peak magnitude in parameter space is available from the multiple peak detection circuitry. The magnitude of the peak indirectly yields the length of the line segments in image space. The system can adapt to varying image intensities. This feature can be used to locate weak targets and avoid neuron amplifier saturation. A signal perturbation technique can be used to enhance resolution or reduce hardware requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147712/","accessionNumber":"4076494","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hough transform system enhancements resulting from neural network implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hough transform system enhancements resulting from neural network implementation","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035776S","chronDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"550","citationCount":"6","articleId":"147712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":147734,"authors":[{"name":"I.-R.

The static design is contrasted with a dynamic design in which a centralized controller must be used to perform proper system reconfiguration as actuator failures occur. In the static approach, the control function of the software is distributed to n (nonidentical) modules and no system reconfiguration is needed to tolerate module failures, while in the dynamic approach, central software is used to reconfigure the system as module failures occur. The system reliability of the static approach is compared with that of the dynamic approach, and the design conditions under which one approach may yield better system reliability than the other are identified.

The network modification and the input-output sensitivity analysis presented can be extended to other neural networks designed for online applications, where noise is an important factor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147774/","accessionNumber":"4076506","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of an induction motor incipient fault detector neural network subject to small input perturbations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of an induction motor incipient fault detector neural network subject to small input perturbations","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070732S","chronDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"550","citationCount":"1","articleId":"147774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":147850,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Evidence also exists to suggest that the binary partitioned neural network approach requires less training data than the use of a single large network. The binary partitioning approach was used to develop a talker identifier system for the 47 male speakers belonging to the Northern dialect region of the TIMIT database.

The zip code images were retrieved from the database supplied by the Office of Advanced Technology, US Postal Services. Therefore, they represent a set of totally unconstrained handwritten numerals from the real world. Preprocessing consisting of segmentation and normalization to a standard size was carried out. All the segmented images were normalized to size 19*19 by the averaging method. The aspect ratio of the original images was kept the same.

Fukushima's cognitron (1975) are presented. The goal was to increase the selectivity and robustness of the network, which was used as the final stage identifier in an integrated vision network invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. Unlike the original cognitron, different inhibitory parameters were introduced for differential layers so that selectivity of excitatory cells of different layers could be adjusted in a flexible manner. A supervised learning scheme was adopted in the last layer so that different learning samples could be related to the output elements in a desired order. Choosing relatively large values of the inhibitory parameter for the input layer and supervised learning parameter for the output layer improved the performance of the recognition system. The network used 64*64 binary M-transformed images as its input patterns. Computer simulation indicated that by adjusting the structure parameters of the network a tradeoff between selectivity and robustness could be made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4081672","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a cognitron type neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a cognitron type neural network","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03317S","chronDate":"7-10 Apr 1991","isNumber":"3921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"550","articleId":"147855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":147882,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By a proper choice of network parameters it is possible to ensure valid solutions to the problem. An illustrative four-city example effectively points out the practical considerations required for a novice in this area to implement this problem successfully. For the example, the solutions obtained for random, normalized intercity distances were always valid. In addition, 90% of the results were optimal solutions.

A learning algorithm and an appropriate performance model have been used to synthesize a nonlinear functional relationship between varying plant parameters and control gains. A performance model is used to exemplify the desired responses and force the plant/controller dynamics via a neural network to imitate the model. The performance model contains the proper dynamics to supply desired responses to given test inputs. An arbitrary cost function is used to indicate the quality of plant/controller performance according to which the adjustments to the weights within the neural network are made by the learning algorithm. The process is repeated until the neural network produces an optimal set of gains for each point in the plant parameter space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/147978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Mar 1991","conferenceDate":"26-27 March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4143783","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based control system design of an advanced fighter aircraft","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based control system design of an advanced fighter aircraft","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00147978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053249S","chronDate":"26-27 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"559","citationCount":"1","articleId":"147978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":148000,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

A variety of structures has been fabricated, including electrostatic micro-motors, rotating microwave switches, and variable interdigitated capacitors. A rotating microwave transmission line switch exhibited less than 0.5 dB insertion loss and greater than 35 dB isolation from DC to 45 GHz.

The SVD exhibits better numerical stability due to the insensitivity to ill-conditioning or rank deficiency of matrices. However, the SVD is computationally intensive. The CORDIC array processor element (CAPE) is a single chip VLSI implementation of a processor element for the Brent-Luk-VanLoan systolic array which computes the SVD of a real matrix. The array utilizes CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) arithmetic to perform the vector rotations and inverse tangent calculations in hardware. A six-chip prototype of the processor has been implemented as TinyChips using the MOSIS fabrication service. Experienced gain from designing the prototype helped in the design of integrated single-chip version.

Hardware schemes are proposed for decompressing data that has been compressed using the LZ method. The data compression hardware can be integrated into real-time systems so that data can be compressed and decompressed on-the-fly.

Ground strap positioning also affects the ESD-induced electromagnetic field in the interior of unshielded equipment, with closer positioning parallel to the gun rod reducing test severity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1991.148226","pdfPath":"/iel2/585/3925/00148226.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1991.148226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some fundamental aspects of ESD testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Some fundamental aspects of ESD testing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4178607","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"12 July-16 Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some fundamental aspects of ESD testing","confLoc":"Cherry Hill, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00148226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040555S","chronDate":"12-16 Aug 1991","isNumber":"3925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"585","citationCount":"22","articleId":"148226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":148262,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

The FD-TD algorithm implemented incorporates a multizone gridding scheme to accommodate fine grid cells in the vicinity of the heatsink and package cavity and sparse gridding in the remainder of the computational domain. The issues pertaining to the effects of the heatsink in influencing the overall radiating capacity of the configuration are addressed. Analyses are facilitated by using simplified heatsink models and by using dipole elements as sources of electromagnetic energy to model the VLSI chip. The potential for enhancement of spurious emissions by the heatsink structure is illustrated. For heatsinks of typical dimensions, resonance is possible within the low gigahertz frequency range. The potential exploitation of the heatsink as an emissions shield by appropriate implementation schemes is discussed and evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1991.148262","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel2/585/3925/00148262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.1991.148262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3925","startPage":"393","endPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic radiation from a VLSI package and heatsink configuration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic radiation from a VLSI package and heatsink configuration","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148262/","conferenceDate":"12 July-16 Aug. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4173882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic radiation from a VLSI package and heatsink configuration","confLoc":"Cherry Hill, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00148262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033343S","chronDate":"12-16 Aug 1991","isNumber":"3925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"585","citationCount":"18","articleId":"148262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":148323,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Compared with the commonly used resistor load in multivalued logic (MVL) circuits, this circuit design offers better noise margins, lower power dissipation, and easier integration. SPICE was used to simulate a three-state memory circuit, functioning as a MVL cell and consisting of a series connection of two RTDs and a MESFET depletion load. It is shown that the simulated multipeak I-V curve for this MVM cell is in good agreement with the measurement results from the two discrete RTDs connected in series. The signal write and read operations for this MVM circuit are also successfully simulated, and these operations were reliable and showed fast response. Some important effects on the MVM circuit due to the parasitic resistor and capacitor in the RTD are discussed.

A hard bound is one that is sure to be satisfied, i.e. the true system Nyquist plot will be confined with certainty to a given region, provided that the underlying assumptions are satisfied. By blending a priori knowledge and information obtained from measured data, it is shown how the uncertainty of transfer function estimates can be quantified. The emphasis is on errors due to model mismatch. The effects of unmodeled dynamics can be considered as bounded disturbances. Hence, techniques from set membership identification can be applied to this problem. The approach taken corresponds to weighted least-squares estimation, and provides hard frequency-domain transfer function error bounds. The main assumptions used in the current contribution are: that the measurement errors are bounded, that the true system is indeed linear with a certain degree of stability, and that there is some knowledge about the shape of the true frequency response.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.148343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.148343","endPage":"912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/3927/00148343.pdf","startPage":"900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hard frequency-domain model error bounds from least-squares like identification techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148343/","displayDocTitle":"Hard frequency-domain model error bounds from least-squares like identification techniques","volume":"37","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4236211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hard frequency-domain model error bounds from least-squares like identification techniques","sourcePdf":"00148343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068392S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"3927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"161","articleId":"148343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":148344,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

This prior information took the form of parameterized bounding functions or parameterized probability density functions, in the time or frequency domain with known parameters. It is shown that the parameters that quantify this prior information can themselves be estimated from the data using a maximum likelihood technique. This significantly reduces the prior information required to estimate transfer function error bounds. The authors illustrate the usefulness of the method with a number of simulation examples. How the obtained error bounds can be used for intelligent model-order selection that takes into account both measurement noise and under-modeling is shown.

In the symmetric case, the Hessian eigenvalues are closely related to the squares of the closed-loop Lyapunov singular values.

Unlike the so-called global path planning methods, this approach does not require an expensive computation step before the search for a path can actually start, and it searches a graph that is usually much smaller than the graph searched by the so-called local methods. A collection of effective techniques to implement this approach is described. They are based on the use of multiscale pyramids of bitmap arrays for representing both the robot's workspace and configuration space. This distributed representation makes it possible to construct potential fields numerically, rather than analytically. A path planner based on these techniques has been implemented. Experiments with this planner show that it is both very fast and capable of handling many degrees of freedom.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Orbital robotics","Manipulators","Joining processes","Robot motion","Motion planning","Mobile robots","Military computing","Computational Intelligence Society","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","navigation","planning (artificial intelligence)","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot path planning","graph","local minima","potential field","configuration space","multiscale pyramids","bitmap arrays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148426","doi":"10.1109/21.148426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/21/3929/00148426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.148426","startPage":"224","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical potential field techniques for robot path planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical potential field techniques for robot path planning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1992","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1992","accessionNumber":"4241404","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical potential field techniques for robot path planning","sourcePdf":"00148426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028342S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1992","isNumber":"3929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"548","articleId":"148426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":148443,"authors":[{"name":"E.B.

The use of an object-oriented language provides the data abstraction facilities necessary to support modification and extension of the simulation system at a high level of abstraction.

It is argued that device improvements obtained from exploiting the dependence of physical characteristics of silicon at low temperature are above and beyond those improvements obtained from the usual geometric scaling of device dimensions. As device geometries continue to shrink into the deep submicrometer regime, second-order effects begin to limit further increases in device speed from scaling alone. Temperature scaling provides an additional variable for system optimization. The gain in performance at cryogenic temperatures, however, is at the expense of inconvenience and additional cost for system refrigeration, and of increased susceptibility to hot carrier degradation. Optimizing CMOS technology and design for low-temperature applications can increase performance and reduce power dissipation without increasing hot carrier degradation. Reliability considerations and a brief review of available refrigeration systems are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148509/","volume":"15","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4246270","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low temperature CMOS-a brief review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low temperature CMOS-a brief review","sourcePdf":"00148509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102026S","chronDate":"Jun 1992","isNumber":"3932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"54","articleId":"148509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":148536,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

Ultrasound pulses and transmitted radiation patterns from individual elements in the arrays are measured. A diffraction theory for the continuous wave pressure field of a 2-D array element is generalized to include both electrical and acoustical cross-coupling between elements. This theory can be fit to model the measured radiation patterns of 2-D array elements, giving an indication of the level of cross-coupling in the array, and the velocity of the acoustic cross-coupling wave. Improvements in bandwidth and cross-coupling resulting from the inclusion of a front acoustic matching layer are demonstrated, and the effects of including a lossy backing material on the array are discussed. A broadband electrical matching network is described, and pulse-echo waveforms and insertion loss from a 2-D array element are measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4242097","pubMedId":"18267657","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of transducer elements in two-dimensional arrays for medical ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication and characterization of transducer elements in two-dimensional arrays for medical ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"00148536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040063S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"66","articleId":"148536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":148540,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

An error analysis based on an objective mean-square-error (MSE) criterion is used to motivate regularization.

In 2D, this is equivalent to confining the support of the phase function to one or more arbitrarily shaped regions. A phase unwrapping algorithm is presented which works for 2D data known only within a set of nonconnected regions with possibly nonconvex boundaries. The algorithm includes the following steps: segmentation to identify connectivity, phase unwrapping within each segment using a Taylor series expansion, phase unwrapping between disconnected segments along an optimum path, and filling of phase information voids. The optimum path for intersegment unwrapping is determined by a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Although the algorithm is applicable to any 2D data, the main application addressed is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where phase maps are useful.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using a minimum spanning tree algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.148608","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3937/00148608.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.148608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using a minimum spanning tree algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4248017","pubMedId":"18296168","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using a minimum spanning tree algorithm","sourcePdf":"00148608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063421S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"70","articleId":"148608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":148610,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The system model and inversion incorporate the radiation pattern of the array's elements. The inversion method utilizes the time samples of the echoed signals for each scan angle instead of range focusing. It is shown that the temporal Fourier transform of the phased array scan data provides the distribution of the spatial Fourier transform of the reflectivity function for the medium to be imaged. The extent of this coverage is related to the array's length and the temporal frequency bandwidth of the transmitted pulsed signal. Sampling constraints and reconstruction procedure for the imaging system are discussed. It is shown that the imaging information obtained by the inversion of phased array scan data is equivalent to the image reconstructed from its synthesized array counterpart.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3937/00148610.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.148610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.148610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array imaging with beam-steered data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Focusing","Image reconstruction","Apertures","Fourier transforms","Reflectivity","Frequency","Bandwidth","Signal generators","Image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative phase linear variation","sampling constraints","beam-steered data","phased array scan data","inversion method","scan angle","temporal Fourier transform","spatial Fourier transform","temporal frequency bandwidth","transmitted pulsed signal","reconstruction procedure","imaging information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Array imaging with beam-steered data","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4248019","pubMedId":"18296170","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array imaging with beam-steered data","sourcePdf":"00148610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046229S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"31","articleId":"148610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":148611,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

An important special case is the circular boundary aperture. When these apertures are used with beamforming to produce a narrowband image of a far-field source, the corresponding point spread function (PSF) is characterized by high sidelobes. The concept of the coarray of an imaging system is used here to develop techniques which synthesize the effect of a more desirable PSF with an elliptical boundary aperture. Techniques are given for use in active imaging of spatially coherent sources, as well as passive imaging of spatially incoherent sources. Discrete arrays and continuous apertures are considered separately. The approach shows that the PSF synthesis problem can be solved in many more ways than previously recognized, and this fact is exploited to develop procedures which have a least-squares optimality property.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.148611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/3937/00148611.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.148611","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"391","endPage":"405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coarray synthesis with circular and elliptical boundary arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1992","displayDocTitle":"Coarray synthesis with circular and elliptical boundary arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148611/","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4248020","pubMedId":"18296171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coarray synthesis with circular and elliptical boundary arrays","sourcePdf":"00148611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023784S","chronDate":"July  1992","isNumber":"3937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"20","articleId":"148611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":148614,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-S.

One application domain for generic object recognition is the handling and sorting of postal objects. Because metrical information relating object features to one another is not available, the more common feature-based approaches are inadequate. INGEN (inference engine for generic object recognition), uses a data-driven approach to determine the pose and size of objects with generic shapes such as parallelepipeds and cylinders. This system successfully recognizes occluded objects in heaps. It also handles scenes which have irregularities in surfaces and edges-such irregularities are common to postal objects-as well as shadows and irregularities in the range data itself.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Workshop on Directions in Automated CAD-Based Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/339/3939/00148773.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Workshop on Directions in Automated CAD-Based Vision","doi":"10.1109/CADVIS.1991.148773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CADVIS.1991.148773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=148773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"INGEN: a robot vision system for generic object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot vision systems","Object recognition","Shape","Layout","Surface fitting","Image processing","Image recognition","Sorting","Engine cylinders","Postal services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","computerised pattern recognition","computerised picture processing","inference mechanisms","mailing systems","solid modelling","spatial reasoning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["INGEN","robot vision","generic object recognition","shape recognition","shape models","postal objects","inference engine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"INGEN: a robot vision system for generic object recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4117485","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-3 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"INGEN: a robot vision system for generic object recognition","confLoc":"Maui, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00148773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033741S","chronDate":"2-3 Jun 1991","isNumber":"3939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"339","citationCount":"1","articleId":"148773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":148786,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The microactuators are driven by various forces suitable in the microdomain. The advantages and the limitations of fabrication processes suggest that microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) in which microactuators play a key role would be completely different from simple miniaturization of macro-machines. A possible architecture oriented toward MEMSs is a system composed of many smart micromodules, each module having a microactuator, sensors and electrical circuits integrated in itself. As an example, a ciliary motion system and its actuators are explained. Promising applications of MEMSs seem to be in optics, magnetic and optical heads, fluidics, handling cells and macromolecules, and microscopy with microprobes such as scanning tunneling microscopes and atomic force microscopes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/148786/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4143451","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"New opportunities for microactuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New opportunities for microactuators","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00148786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068586S","chronDate":"24-27 June 1991","isNumber":"3940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"505","citationCount":"23","articleId":"148786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":148800,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The complexity of an AFM is predominantly governed by the detector used for measuring the deflection of the cantilever probe. The authors describe the fabrication of a silicon cantilever beam with an integrated piezoresistor for sensing its deflection. A silicon-on-insulator material is used for the fabrication. A p-type resistor is fabricated at the surface of the cantilever along a <110> direction so that the piezoresistive effect of silicon causes its resistance to vary linearly with its deflection. The cantilevers considered typically have spring constants from 1 to 10 N/m and minimum detectable deflections from 1 to 10 AA over a 10-Hz-1-kHz frequency range. The cantilevers were successfully used in an AFM, and an image of a grating was obtained with this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.1991.148908","publicationTitle":"TRANSDUCERS '91: 1991 International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators.

Five-lead cables with a total thickness of 5 mu m have been fabricated with lengths ranging from 2.5 to 5 cm. These cables are very flexible and yet very strong. Soak tests in buffered saline under electrical and mechanical stress show leakage currents in the sub-picoamp range after over 175 days under +or-5-V bias. Cables integrated into multichannel silicon neural recording probes have been implanted in guinea pigs and remain functional after over four months in-vivo, maintaining impedance levels in the 3-9-M Omega range.

The feedforward terms are adjusted by an adaptation law so that the steady-state position errors are zero. The regulator gain matrix can be fixed or time-varying; in the latter case, the adaptive scheme becomes similar to the computed torque scheme.

A spot projection image, which is obtained from the vision sensor, is transformed into a pattern of invariance to the up-down and/or left-right translation of the object.

An exhaustive search to find the best assignment mapping one set of points to another set is, if the number of points that are to be matched is large, computationally expensive. A genetic algorithm that searches for the best ('almost the best') assignment efficiently is described. To map the point pattern matching into the framework of a genetic algorithm, a fitness function that is inversely proportional to the match error and a scheme for encoding an assignment between two sets of points into a string are used, along with a genetic operator known as the mixed-type partial matching crossover. Experimental results have demonstrated the robustness and the fast convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm can be applied to n-dimensional point patterns and any transformation. Results are presented for two-dimensional point patterns and a similarity transformation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1990.149313","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1238 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IECON '90: 16th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1990.149313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3941","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IECON '90: 16th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel2/510/3941/00149313.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point pattern matching by a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149313/","displayDocTitle":"Point pattern matching by a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4101937","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point pattern matching by a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00149313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037607S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"510","citationCount":"12","articleId":"149313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":149314,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.H.

The use of both methods is recommended for the construction of intelligent controllers (for example, autonomous or self-organizing controllers). Intelligent controllers are summarized. Fuzzy control is illustrated in a tutorial fashion by a simple example. The design and practical aspects of fuzzy control are examined. Neural networks applied to control problems are discussed. By combining the two methodologies, self-organizing controller can be constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1990.149328","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1343 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IECON '90: 16th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1990.149328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3941","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IECON '90: 16th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel2/510/3941/00149328.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy and neural network controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149328/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy and neural network controller","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4096847","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy and neural network controller","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00149328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041999S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov 1990","isNumber":"3941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"510","citationCount":"11","articleId":"149328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":149425,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The 13.18-mm*6.38-mm chip, organized as either 512 K word*8 b or 1 M word*4 b, achieves a nominal random-access time of 14 ns and a nominal column-access time of 7 ns, with a 3.6-V V/sub cc/ and provision of address multiplexing. The high level of performance is achieved by using a short-signal-path architecture with center bonding pads and a pulsed sensing scheme with a limited bit-line swing. A fast word-line boosting scheme and a two-stage word-line delay monitor provide fast word-line transition and detection. A new data output circuit, which interfaces a 3.6-V V/sub cc/ to a 5-V bus with an NMOS-only driver, also contributes to the fast access speed by means of a preconditioning scheme and boosting scheme. Limiting the bit-line voltage swing for bit-line sensing results in a low power dissipation of 300 mW for a 60-ns cycle time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.149425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3944/00149425.pdf","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.149425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 14-ns 14-Mb CMOS DRAM with 300-mW active power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 14-ns 14-Mb CMOS DRAM with 300-mW active power","volume":"27","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4277356","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149425/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 14-ns 14-Mb CMOS DRAM with 300-mW active power","sourcePdf":"00149425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038851S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"3944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"149425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":149426,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This block is used repeatedly to construct an RST block in which even wiring among blocks included in wire shifters is designed as recurring units. By using recurring wire shifters, the authors can expand the level of repeated blocks to cover the entire adder tree, which simplifies the complicated Wallace tree wiring scheme.

A block-decoded sense-amplifier driver concept is proposed. Optimized trigger pulse shapes are formed with local driver circuits to achieve high sensing safety at the beginning of the sensing period as well as fast amplification in the cell block containing the addressed memory cell. The nonaddressed blocks are triggered more slowly to reduce the peak current. Thus, reliable sensing of small initial sense signals is obtained in the shortest possible time, while the total current is kept small. As an example, for a 16-Mb DRAM, the sensing time-and hence the access time-can be reduced by at least 5 ns and is about 50% of the conventional sensing time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.149435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.149435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3944/00149435.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-decoded sense-amplifier driver for high-speed sensing in DRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Block-decoded sense-amplifier driver for high-speed sensing in DRAM's","volume":"27","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4277364","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149435/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-decoded sense-amplifier driver for high-speed sensing in DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00149435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064977S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"3944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"1","articleId":"149435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":149436,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. De Cock","affiliation":["Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","Mietec-Alcatel n.v., Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"De Cock","id":"37411429200"},{"name":"D.

The PWM/PAM has been used to build a four-quadrant analog multiplier (4-QAM) with a DC transfer function that depends only on resistor matching and on the value of a reference voltage. The PWM/PAM circuit was fabricated in a 3- mu m CMOS process; measurements show a small total error (maximum 2% of full scale) without trimming, a high temperature stability (+or-6 ppm/ degrees C), and a low supply voltage sensitivity (+or-25 ppm/%). The total harmonic distortion of the PWM is less than 0.05% (measured for a clock frequency of 200 kHz). Analytic design equations include a DC error model, a stability criterion, and the relation between the maximum bandwidth and the clock frequency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation","Distortion measurement","Clocks","Frequency","Quadrature phase shift keying","Transfer functions","Resistors","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","modulators","multiplying circuits","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse-width modulator","pulse-amplitude modulator","four-quadrant analog multipliers","Tomota-Sugiyama-Yamaguchi principle","DC transfer function","resistor matching","reference voltage","CMOS process","temperature stability","supply voltage sensitivity","total harmonic distortion","clock frequency","design equations","DC error model","stability criterion","maximum bandwidth","3 micron","200 kHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.149436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3944/00149436.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.149436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS pulse-width modulator/pulse-amplitude modulator for four-quadrant analog multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=149436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS pulse-width modulator/pulse-amplitude modulator for four-quadrant analog multipliers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149436/","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4277365","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS pulse-width modulator/pulse-amplitude modulator for four-quadrant analog multipliers","sourcePdf":"00149436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03679S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"3944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"149436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":149445,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

It is considered that a specific family of codes is characterized by a unique distance distribution exponent. The tight linear lower bound of slope -1 on the code family error exponent represents the code family cutoff rate bound. It is always a minimum of a sum of three functions. The intrinsic asymptotic properties of channel block codes are revealed by analyzing these functions and their relationships. It is shown that the random coding technique for lower-bounding the channel error exponent is a special case of this general method.

In the algorithm implemented, intensity, edgeness, and cornerness attributes are used in conjunction with the constraints arising from intraregional smoothness, field continuity and discontinuity, and occlusions to compute dense displacement fields and occlusion maps along the pixel grids. The intensity, edgeness, and cornerness are invariant under rigid motion in the image plane. In order to cope with large disparities, a multiresolution multigrid structure is employed. Coarser level edgeness and cornerness measures are obtained by blurring the finer level measures. The algorithm has been tested on real-world scenes with depth discontinuities and occlusions. A special case of two-view matching is stereo matching, where the motion between two images is known. The algorithm can be easily specialized to perform stereo matching using the epipolar constraint.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.149592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.149592","endPage":"825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3951/00149592.pdf","startPage":"806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching two perspective views","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149592/","displayDocTitle":"Matching two perspective views","volume":"14","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4246273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching two perspective views","sourcePdf":"00149592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042443S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"3951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"133","articleId":"149592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":149593,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For maximum power efficiency, the squared rotor flux is adjusted according to a minimum power search algorithm until the measured power input reaches the minimum. Since the motor speed is dynamically decoupled from the rotor flux, this can be done successfully without any degradation of motor speed responses. The controller depends on rotor resistance but not on stator resistance. However, the performance of the control scheme is robust with respect to variations in rotor resistance because an identification algorithm for rotor resistance is employed. The identification algorithm for rotor resistance has some advantages over the previous methods.

The maximum allowable delay at each sink pin (from a timing analyzer) along with the computer interconnection delays is used to guide the search process for the maximum-delay-slack route.

The main problem lies in the conventional approach of using scalar control, where optimal steady-state temperature uniformity at one set of processing conditions is used to fix the hardware geometry, leaving only one input variable-the lamp power-for control. It is demonstrated that this control is inadequate, since the radiative and convective heat exchange at the wafer are functions of the processing conditions, and that the resultant nonuniformity can be corrected by dynamic control of the spatial optical flux profile. Such control is demonstrated through two key innovations: a lamp system in which tungsten-halogen point sources are configured in three concentric rings to provide a circularly symmetric flux profile, and multivariable control whereby each of the three rings is independently and dynamically controlled to provide for control over the spatial flux profile. This approach offers good temperature uniformity over transients, thus improving reliability of individual processes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/66.149811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.149811","startPage":"180","endPage":"188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/3958/00149811.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid thermal processing uniformity using multivariable control of a circularly symmetric 3 zone lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Rapid thermal processing uniformity using multivariable control of a circularly symmetric 3 zone lamp","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4247369","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149811/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid thermal processing uniformity using multivariable control of a circularly symmetric 3 zone lamp","sourcePdf":"00149811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037068S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"3958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"49","articleId":"149811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":149874,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Potential for a DWDM channel spacing of 10 GHz is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.149874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.149874","endPage":"823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3962/00149874.pdf","startPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An InGaAs/GaAs SQW laser integrated with a surface-emitting harmonic generator for DWDM applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149874/","displayDocTitle":"An InGaAs/GaAs SQW laser integrated with a surface-emitting harmonic generator for DWDM applications","volume":"4","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4273199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An InGaAs/GaAs SQW laser integrated with a surface-emitting harmonic generator for DWDM applications","sourcePdf":"00149874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07289S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"3962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"13","articleId":"149874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":149880,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

At each repeater the counterpropagating signals are separated, amplified separately, and then recombined. Signal separation is done by directional couplers with intrinsic 6-dB coupling loss, or by optical circulators with no intrinsic loss. Although the 3-dB input directional coupler loss can be compensated with a few milliwatts extra pump power, it increases the amplifier noise figure by 3 dB. The pump power required to compensate for the output directional coupler loss increases with the output signal power to 3 dB when the amplifier is saturated. The saturation output power of the directional coupler module is approximately 3 dB lower than the optical circulator. Multiple reflection induced relative intensity noise is reduced by assigning nonoverlapping optical bands to the signals in the two directions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.149906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.149906","startPage":"911","endPage":"913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3962/00149906.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidirectional fiber amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Bidirectional fiber amplifiers","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"4","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4273231","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149906/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidirectional fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00149906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02817S","chronDate":"Aug.  1992","isNumber":"3962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"21","articleId":"149906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":149907,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, bidirectional pumping requires more components which can increase the complexity and cost of the system. In this work, a computer model was used to compare the performance of power EDFAs with a Bragg reflecting pump mirror etched at the output end of the fiber. For small pump powers (P/sub p/ approximately=10 mW) this configuration is better than bidirectional pumping, both for gain and noise figure.

The algorithm is novel in the sense that it not only learns rules for a given concept (classification), but it simultaneously learns rules relating multiple concepts. This type of learning, known as generalized rule induction, is considerably more general than existing algorithms, which tend to be classification oriented. Initially, it is focused on the problem of determining a quantitative, well-defined rule preference measure. In particular, a quantity called the J-measure is proposed as an information-theoretic alternative to existing approaches. The J-measure quantifies the information content of a rule or a hypothesis. The information theoretic origins of this measure are outlined, and its plausibility as a hypothesis preference measure is examined. The ITRULE algorithm, which uses the measure to learn a set of optimal rules from a set of data samples, is defined.

The authors coin the phrase 'potential energy conserving orbit' to describe this class of trajectories. Based on these properties, control laws were formulated for walk initiation, walk continuation, and walk termination. The walking motion is controlled by support leg exchange. Robust realization of the walking control is also considered. An experimental walking machine was designed as a nearly ideal biped model. To make the legs lighter, four DC motors were mounted in the body, and the legs are parallel link structures.

A common strategy to solve this problem is to estimate the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue of the spatial covariance matrix R of the sensed data. Existing approaches rely on the closeness of the noise eigenvalues of sample covariance matrix to each other and, therefore, the sample size has to be quite large when the number of sources is large in order to obtain a good estimate. The theoretical analysis presented focuses on the splitting of the spectrum of sample covariance matrix into noise and signal eigenvalues. It is shown that when the number of sensors is large the number of signals can be estimated with a sample size considerably less than that required by previous approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.149981","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3966/00149981.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.149981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2100","endPage":"2105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal detection via spectral theory of large dimensional random matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=149981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection via spectral theory of large dimensional random matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149981/","volume":"40","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4273660","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection via spectral theory of large dimensional random matrices","sourcePdf":"00149981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0643S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"3966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","articleId":"149981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":149989,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The simplex algorithm for linear programming is used to find a best linear-phase FIR filter of minimum length, as well as to find the minimum feasible length itself. The simplex algorithm, while much slower than exchange algorithms, also allows the incorporation of more general kinds of constraints, such as concavity constraints (which can be used to achieve very flat magnitude characteristics). Examples are given to illustrate how the proposed and common approaches differ, and how the proposed approach can be used to design filters with flat passbands, filters which meet point constraints, minimum phase filters, and bandpass filters with controlled transition band behavior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","volume":"40","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4273638","publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"METEOR: a constraint-based FIR filter design program","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"METEOR: a constraint-based FIR filter design program","sourcePdf":"00149993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039612S","chronDate":"Aug 1992","isNumber":"3966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","articleId":"149993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":149995,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The recently introduced wavelet transforms provide a time-and-scale decomposition of signals that offers the possibility of such analysis. A corresponding statistical framework to support the development of optimal, multiscale statistical signal processing algorithms is described. The theory of multiscale signal representation leads naturally to models of signals on trees, and this provides the framework for investigation. In particular, the class of isotropic processes on homogeneous trees is described, and a theory of autoregressive models is developed in this context. This leads to generalizations of Schur and Levinson recursions, associated properties of the resulting reflection coefficients, and the initial pieces in a system theory for multiscale modeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/149995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1992","volume":"40","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1992","accessionNumber":"4273640","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale autoregressive processes.
