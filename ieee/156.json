Results indicate that the use of any single, simple synthetic metric to predict performance does an inadequate job, and the use of a linear combination of these simple metrics with optimized weights also performs poorly. Better, however, are methodologies that rely on the convolution of an application \"transfer function\" based on tracing information with system performance data measured by simple benchmarks. This latter methodology can predict performance with an average accuracy of 80%, based on the current work.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.33","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01560000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","startPage":"48","endPage":"48","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"How well can simple metrics represent the performance of HPC applications?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560000/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How well can simple metrics represent the performance of HPC applications?","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01560000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11439S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1560000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1560011,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We model this problem as a Boolean network that covers all possible partial terms which may be used to generate the set of coefficients in the MCM instance. The PIs to this network are shifted versions of the MCM input. An AND gate represents an adder or a subtracter, i.e., an AND gate generates a new partial term. All partial terms that have the same numerical value are ORed together. There is a single output which is an /spl and/ over all the coefficients in the MCM. We cast this problem into a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) problem by requiring that the output is asserted while minimizing the total number of AND gates that evaluate to one. A SAT-based solver is used to obtain the exact solution. We argue that for many real problems the size of the problem is within the capabilities of current SAT solvers. We present results using binary, CSD and MSD representations. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results. One is that, in many cases, existing heuristics perform well, computing the best solution, or one close to it. The other is that the flexibility of the MSD representation does not have a significant impact in the solution obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exact algorithm for the maximal sharing of partial terms in multiple constant multiplications","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

Considering both die-to-die and within-die variations in effective channel length, threshold voltage, and gate oxide thickness, we first develop closed-form models of leakage and timing variations at the FPGA chip level. Experiments show that our models are within 3% from Monte Carlo simulation, and the leakage and delay variations can be up to 3/spl times/ and 1.9/spl times/, respectively. We then derive analytical yield models considering both leakage and timing variations, and use such models to evaluate FPGA device and architecture under process variations. Compared to the architecture similar to a commercial FPGA and device setting from ITRS roadmap, device tuning alone improves leakage yield by 39% and architecture and device co-optimization increases leakage yield by 73%. We also show that LUT size 4 gives the highest leakage yield, LUT size 7 gives the highest timing yield, but LUT size 5 achieves the maximum combined leakage and timing yield.

In comparison, not much attention has been paid to the detailed placement problem. Existing detailed placers either fail to improve upon the excellent solution quality enabled by good global placers or are very slow. To handle the above problems, we focus on the detailed placement problem. We present an efficient and effective detailed placement algorithm to handle the wirelength minimization problem. The main contributions of our work are: (1) an efficient Global Swap technique to identify a pair of cells that can be swapped to reduce wirelength; (2) a flow that combines the Global Swap technique with other heuristics to produce very good wirelength; (3) an efficient single-segment clustering technique to optimally shift cells within a segment to minimize wirelength. On legalized mPL5 global placements on the IBM standard-cell benchmarks, our detailed placer can achieve 19.0%, 13.2% and 0.5% more wirelength reduction compared to Fengshui5.0, rowironing and Domino respectively. Correspondingly we are 3.6/spl times/ 2.8/spl times/ and 15/spl times/ faster.

This paper proposes a technique for wirelength minimization based on in-place flipping of cells that can be applied to any floorplan style consisting of rectangular blocks or sub-blocks. Instead of conventional search procedures, a Boolean symbolic approach is proposed to generate flip-optimal floorplans. Experimental results show that it can effectively reduce the wirelength of current state of the art approaches, at no cost in area and with modest runtimes.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

Unlike the traditional multilevel framework that adopts the \"V-cycle\" framework: bottom-up coarsening followed by top-down uncoarsening, in contrast, IMF works in the \"/spl Lambda/-cycle\" manner: top-down uncoarsening (partitioning) followed by bottom-up coarsening (merging). The top-down partitioning stage iteratively partitions the floorplan region based on mm-cut bipartitioning with exact net-weight modeling to reduce the number of global interconnections and thus the total wirelength. Then, the bottom-up merging stage iteratively applies fixed-outline floorplanning using simulated annealing for all regions and merges two neighboring regions recursively. We also propose an accelerative fixed-outline floorplanning (AFF) to speed up wirelength minimization under the outline constraint. Experimental results show that IMF consistently obtains the best floorplanning results with the smallest wirelength for large-scale building-module designs, compared with all publicly available floorplanners. In particular, IMF scales very well as the circuit size increases. The /spl Lambda/-cycle multilevel framework outperforms the V-cycle one in the optimization of global circuit effects, such as interconnection and crosstalk optimization, since the /spl Lambda/-cycle framework considers the global configuration first and then processes down to local ones level by level and thus the global effects can be handled at earlier stages.

Among the various types of DG devices, quasi-planar SOI FinFETs are easier to manufacture compared to planar double-gate devices. DG devices with independent gates (separate contacts to back and front gates) have recently been developed. DG devices with symmetric and asymmetric gates have also been demonstrated. Such device options have direct implications at the circuit level. Independent control of front and back gate in DG devices can be effectively used to improve performance and reduce power in sub-50nm circuits. Independent gate control can be used to merge parallel transistors in noncritical paths. This results in reduction in the effective switching capacitance and hence power dissipation. We show a variety of circuits in logic and memory that can benefit from independent gate operation of DG devices. As examples, we show the benefit of independent gate operation in circuits such as dynamic logic circuits, Schmitt triggers, sense amplifiers, and SRAM cells. In addition to independent gate option, we also investigate the usefulness of asymmetric devices and the impact of width quantization and process variations on circuit design.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560067","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

Custom NoC design in nanoscale technologies must address performance requirements, power consumption and physical layout considerations. This paper presents a novel three phase technique that i) generates a performance aware layout of the SoC, ii) maps the cores of the SoC to routers, and iii) generates a unique route for every trace that satisfies the performance and architectural constraints.

The NoC communication architectures considered so far are based on either completely regular or fully customized topologies. In this paper, we present a methodology to automatically synthesize an architecture where a few application-specific long-range links are inserted on top of a regular mesh network. This way, we can better exploit the benefits of both complete regularity and partial customization. Indeed, our experimental results show that inserting application-specific long-range links significantly increases the critical traffic workload at which the network state transits from a free to a congested regime. This, in turn, results in a significant reduction in the average packet latency and a major improvement in the network achievable throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560072","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

As power consumption is proportional to the square of supply voltage, reducing supply voltage can significantly reduce power consumption. Multi-supply voltage (MSV) has previously been introduced to provide finer-grain power and performance trade-off. In this work we propose a methodology on top of a set of algorithms to exploit non-trivial voltage island boundaries for optimal power versus design cost trade-off under performance requirement. Our algorithms are efficient, robust and error-bounded, and can be flexibly tuned to optimize for various design objectives (e.g., minimal power within a given number of voltage islands, or minimal fragmentation in voltage islands within a given power bound) depending on the design requirement. Our experiment on real industry designs shows a ten-fold improvement of our method over current logical-boundary based industry approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post-placement voltage island generation under performance requirement","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

This results in unwanted glitch propagation along the LUTs, and wastes power. This paper proposes a flip-flop insertion, we propose insertion of new flip-flops between adjacent existing flip-flops to minimize glitch propagation and power loss. Each new flip-flop is timed by a phase-shifted clock with the phase calculated from the delays of LUTs and routing paths. This is different from traditional retiming methods that use the original clock or an 180-degree clock for the new flip-flops, and thus alters the original pipeline structure and synchronization. We start from a post-layout design, retiming its clock frequency and timing behavior. Multiple flip-flop insertion is an NP-complete problem because each new flip-flop affects the delays in the design. We have devised a glitch generation and propagation model for LUT-based FPGAs that take account of path delays while supporting reasonable complexity. We propose effective heuristics for flip-flop insertion and clock phase selection. Full-chip measurements, including all the overheads associated with the inserted flip-flops, show that our approach shows up to 38% of the total dynamic power.

It is shown that CNT bundles can outperform copper for long intermediate and global interconnects, and can be engineered to compete with copper for local level interconnects.

In this paper we present a new mapper aimed at mitigating structural bias. It is based on a simplified cut-based Boolean matching algorithm, and using the speed afforded by this simplification we explore two ideas to reduce structural bias. The first, called lossless synthesis, leverages recent advances in structure-based combinational equivalence checking to combine the different networks seen during technology independent synthesis into a single network with choices in a scalable manner. We show how cut based mapping extends naturally to handle such networks with choices. The second idea is to combine several library gates into a single gate (called a supergate) in order to make the matching process less local. We show how supergates help address the structural bias problem, and how they fit naturally into the cut-based Boolean matching scheme. An implementation based on these ideas significantly outperforms state-of-the-art mappers in terms of delay, area and run-time on academic and industrial benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560122","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

However, existing approaches place restrictions on software languages and compilers. Binary-level co-processor generation has previously been proposed as a complementary approach to reduce impact on tool restrictions, supporting all languages and compilers, at the cost of some decrease in performance. In a binary-level approach, decompilation recovers much of the high-level information, like loops and arrays, needed for effective synthesis, and in many cases yields hardware similar to that of a compiler-based approach. However, previous binary-level approaches have not considered the effects of software compiler optimizations on the resulting hardware. In this paper, we introduce two new decompilation techniques, strength promotion and loop rerolling, and show that they are necessary to synthesize an efficient custom hardware coprocessor from a binary in the presence of software compiler optimizations. In addition, unlike previous approaches, we show the robustness of binary-level co-processor generation by achieving order of magnitude speedups for binaries generated for three different instruction sets, MIPS, ARM, and MicroBlaze, using two different levels of compiler optimizations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560127","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

Link based non-tree clock distribution is a cost-effective technique for reducing clock skew variations. However, previous works based on this technique were limited to unbuffered clock networks and neglected spatial correlations in the experimental validation. In this work, we overcome these shortcomings and make the link based non-tree approach feasible for realistic designs. The short circuit risk and multi-driver delay issues in buffered non-tree clock networks are investigated. Our approach is validated with SPICE based Monte Carlo simulations, considering spatial correlations among variations. The experimental results show that our approach can reduce the maximal skew by 47%, improve the skew yield from 15% to 73% on average with a decrease on the total wire and buffer capacitance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560135","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

Our technique uses two extra system unknowns, as well as two extra \"phase condition\" equations, to track quantities related to dynamical frequency/time-period changes. These advances confer significant robustness without appreciable computational overhead. We validate our method on LC, ring and crystal oscillators, predicting frequency and amplitude modulations as well as transient startup envelopes accurately. Speedups of 1-2 orders of magnitude are obtained over traditional alternatives.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Circuit simulation","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Frequency modulation","Time domain analysis","Cities and towns","Equations","Ring oscillators","Amplitude modulation","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oscillators","partial differential equations","circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude tracking","frequency envelope","oscillator envelope following","Petzold method","WaMPDE","phase condition equation","dynamical frequency change","time-period change","LC oscillator","ring oscillator","crystal oscillator","frequency modulation","amplitude modulation","transient startup envelope","multitime partial differential equations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560137","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

This paper proposes a novel approach to the thermal analysis at chip architecture level for efficient dynamic thermal management. Our new approach is based on the observation that the power consumption of architecture level modules in microprocessors running typical workloads presents strong nature of periodicity. Such a feature can be exploited by fast spectrum analysis in frequency domain for computing steady state response. To obtain the transient temperature changes due to initial condition and constant power inputs, numerically stable moment matching approach is carried out. The total transient responses is the addition of the two simulation results. The resulting fast thermal analysis algorithm leads to at least 10/spl times/-100/spl times/ speedup over traditional integration-based transient analysis with small accuracy loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast thermal simulation for architecture level dynamic thermal management","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

By combining statistical sampling sharing with random walks, we devise an efficient localized sensitivity analysis for large power distribution networks such that the analysis can be conducted without solving the complete network. We further show that this sampling-based parametric analysis can be extended from the first order sensitivity analysis to a more accurate second order analysis. By exploiting the natural spatial locality inherent in our algorithm formulation, the second order parametric analysis can be conducted very efficiently even for a large number of global and local variation sources. The proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing large power grids under the influence of process and current loading variations to which the application of the standard brutal-force circuit simulation becomes completely infeasible. Our results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed algorithm both in terms of accuracy and runtime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power grids","Sampling methods","Sensitivity analysis","Power systems","Monte Carlo methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Circuit simulation","Timing","Performance analysis","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","integrated circuit design","network analysis","sampling methods","random processes","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational analysis","large power grids","statistical sampling sharing","parametric random walk algorithm","critical network nodes","localized sensitivity analysis","power distribution network","sampling based parametric analysis","spatial locality","current loading variation","circuit simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560146","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

In this paper, we investigate how the frequency dependence of loop self inductance affects the RLC delay. We show that the pessimism in the estimation of RLC propagation delay could be as high as 30% if the frequency dependence of inductance is not considered properly. As a means of efficiently computing less pessimistic RLC delay values, we present an analytical model of frequency dependent loop self inductance that can be applied to model a wide range of real design scenarios. We demonstrate that our approach is computationally efficient and produces accurate and realistic (less pessimistic) delay values that lead to significantly improved system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560154/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8834376","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560154/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reducing pessimism in RLC delay estimation using an accurate analytical frequency dependent model for inductance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing pessimism in RLC delay estimation using an accurate analytical frequency dependent model for inductance","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01560154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064679S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10431","isNumber":"33130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10431","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"33130","articleId":"1560154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1560160,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xin Li","id":"37280872800"},{"name":"Jiayong Le","affiliation":["Extreme-DA Corporation, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jiayong Le","id":"37273645200"},{"name":"L.T.

Fitting such models requires significantly more simulation samples and solving much larger linear equations. In this paper, we propose a novel projection-based extraction approach, PROBE, to efficiently create quadratic response surface models and capture both inter-die and intra-die variations with affordable computation cost. PROBE applies a novel projection scheme to reduce the response surface modeling cost (i.e., both the required number of samples and the linear equation size) and make the modeling problem tractable even for large problem sizes. In addition, a new implicit power iteration algorithm is developed to find the optimal projection space and solve for the unknown model coefficients. Several circuit examples from both digital and analog circuit modeling applications demonstrate that PROBE can generate accurate response surface models while achieving up to 12/spl times/ speedup compared with the traditional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection-based performance modeling for inter/intra-die variations","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

One effective way of reducing circuit temperature is to introduce thermal through-the-silicon (TTS) vias. In this paper, we extended the TTS-via planning in a multilevel routing framework by Cong and Zhang (2005), but use a much enhanced TTS-via planning algorithm. We formulate the TTS-via minimization problem with temperature constraints as a constrained nonlinear programming problem (NLP) based on the thermal resistive model and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm, named m-ADVP, which solves a sequence of simplified via planning subproblems in alternating direction in a multilevel framework. The vertical via distribution is formulated as a convex programming problem, and the horizontal via planning is based on two efficient techniques: path counting and heat propagation. Experimental results show that the m-ADVP algorithm is more than 200/spl times/ faster than the direct solution to the NPL formulation for via planning with very similar solution quality (within 1% of TS-vias count). However, compared to a recent work of multilevel TS-via planning algorithm based on temperature profiling (Cong and Zhang, 2005), our algorithm can reduce the total TS-via number by over 68% for the same required temperature with similar runtime.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

In this paper, we propose the first router for the flip-chip package in the literature. The router can redistribute nets from wire-bonding pads to bump pads and then route each of them. The router adopts a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, we use the network flow algorithm to solve the assignment problem from the wire-bonding pads to the bump pads, and then create the global routing path for each net. The detailed routing consists of three stages, cross point assignment, net ordering determination, and track assignment, to complete the routing. Experimental results based on seven real designs from the industry demonstrate that the router can reduce the total wirelength by 10.2%, the critical wirelength by 13.4%, and the signal skews by 13.9%, compared with a heuristic algorithm currently used in industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

In this talk, we review recent advances in CDMA and FDMA interconnect schemes that promise to meet all of the above system requirements. The physical transmission line is no longer limited to a direct-coupled metal wire. Rather, it can be accomplished via either wired or wireless mediums through capacitor couplers that reduce the baseband noise and DC power consumption. These new advances in interconnect schemes would fundamentally alter the paradigm of ULSI data communications and enable the design of next generation computing/processing systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2005.1560203","publicationTitle":"ICCAD-2005.

In this paper, we propose a new optimization method for yield optimization under simultaneous leakage power and performance limits. The optimization approach uses a novel leakage power and performance analysis that is statistical in nature and considers the correlation between leakage power and performance to enable accurate computation of circuit yield under power and delay limits. We then propose a new heuristic approach to incrementally compute the gradient of yield with respect to gate sizes in the circuit with high efficiency and accuracy. We then show how this gradient information can be effectively used by a non-linear optimizer to perform yield optimization. We consider both inter-die and intra-die variations with correlated and random components. The proposed approach is implemented and tested and we demonstrate up to 40% yield improvement compared to a deterministically optimized circuit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560212/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8834413","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560212/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parametric yield maximization using gate sizing based on efficient statistical power and delay gradient computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric yield maximization using gate sizing based on efficient statistical power and delay gradient computation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01560212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083276S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10431","isNumber":"33130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10431","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"33130","articleId":"1560212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1560352,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

This standard proposes an open architecture for distributed industrial-process measurement and control systems (IPMCS). The IEC 61499 defines the basic concepts and methodology for the design of modular reusable distributable systems, and paves the way for the new reconfigurable and flexible manufacturing.

Each center may receive world-wide customer orders and collaborates with other friendly manufacturers, sub-contractors, agents, and suppliers to maximize the sales and quality of the goods. The centers together strike a consistent balance in terms of manufacturing speed, quality, material costs, and workload. The queue maintained by the front-end server/coordinator in each center usually contains requests from different internal and external sources. The merged traffic from these sources can inundate the queue buffer and cause overflow easily in high loading situations. As a result this leads to request retransmissions, unreliable collaborations, and unhappy customers. One way to eliminate buffer overflow in non-persistent (transient) situations is to tune the buffer size on the fly to ensure that it always cover the queue length.

The task at hand is a tracking problem in the presence of disturbances. With reference to the tasks assigned to an industrial robot, one important issue is to determine the motion of the joints and the effector of the robot. In order to model robot dynamics we use a neural network that can be implemented in hardware. The synaptic weights are modelled as variable gain cells that can be implemented with a few MOS transistors. The network output signals portray the periodicity and other characteristics of the input signal in unsupervised mode. For the specific purpose of demonstrating the trajectory learning capabilities, a periodic signal with varying characteristics is used. The developed architecture, however, allows for more general learning tasks typical in applications of identification and control. The periodicity of the input signal ensures convergence of the output to a limit cycle. Online versions of the synaptic update can be formulated using simple CMOS circuits. Because the architecture depends on the network generating a stable limit cycle, and consequently a periodic solution which is robust over an interval of parameter uncertainties, we currently place the restriction of a periodic format for the input signals. The simulated network contains interconnected recurrent neurons with continuous-time dynamics. The system emulates random-direction descent of the error as a multidimensional extension to the stochastic approximation. To achieve unsupervised learning in recurrent dynamical systems we propose a synapse circuit which has a very simple structure and is suitable for implementation in VLSI.","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2005.1560420","pdfPath":"/iel5/10439/33134/01560420.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"467","displayPublicationTitle":"INDIN '05. 2005 3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics, 2005.","publicationTitle":"INDIN '05. 2005 3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2005.1560420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analogue recurrent neural network for trajectory learning and other industrial applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An analogue recurrent neural network for trajectory learning and other industrial applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8763411","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1560420/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analogue recurrent neural network for trajectory learning and other industrial applications","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01560420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097835S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10439","isNumber":"33134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10439","xplore-issue":"33134","articleId":"1560420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1560437,"authors":[{"name":"Yuncan Xue","affiliation":["College of Computer & Information Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Changzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yuncan Xue","id":"37087219203"},{"name":"Qiwen Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer & Information Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Changzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qiwen Yang","id":"37087427432"},{"name":"Wei Jian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hubei Automotive Industrial Institute, Shiyan, China"],"lastName":"Wei Jian","id":"37087220463"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9094-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"1560437","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1560437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Scheduling algorithm","Casting","Particle production","Contracts","Furnaces","Job shop scheduling","Steel","Capacity planning","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","casting","production control","production planning","steel manufacture","scheduling","furnaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm","steelmaking-continuous casting production scheduling","optimum furnace charge plan model","premature convergence","mature factor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2005.1560437","pdfPath":"/iel5/10439/33134/01560437.pdf","publicationTitle":"INDIN '05. 2005 3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"INDIN '05. 2005 3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics, 2005.","startPage":"558","endPage":"561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2005.1560437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimum charge plan for steelmaking-continuous casting production scheduling","abstract":"An optimum furnace charge plan model for steelmaking continuous casting planning and scheduling is presented.

The standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type servo control algorithms are not capable of delivering the desired precision under the influence of frictions and disturbances. In this paper neural network model reference adaptive controller (NNMRAC) is used to compensate the frictions and disturbances and the desired precision under the influence of frictions and disturbances is achieved.

The lines identified by the optimization program are used in a subsequent analysis stage to find combinations that may lead to a blackout. This approach is applied to a 30-bus system with encouraging results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Load flow","Power system security","Power transmission lines","Transmission line theory","Network topology","Chaos","Power system analysis computing","Equations","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system faults","power system security","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric power networks","30-bus system","severe multiple contingencies identification","severe disturbances","blackouts","screening stage","optimization problem","power flow feasibility boundary","subsequent analysis stage"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2005.1560502","startPage":"59","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th Annual North American Power Symposium, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th Annual North American Power Symposium, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10440/33135/01560502.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2005.1560502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of severe multiple contingencies in electric power networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of severe multiple contingencies in electric power networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8706488","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1560502/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of severe multiple contingencies in electric power networks","confLoc":"Ames, IA, USA","sourcePdf":"01560502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053394S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10440","isNumber":"33135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10440","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"33135","articleId":"1560502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1560523,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The recorded fault data including the topology and the line data with more than 1000 elements were provided by Detroit Edison (DTE) Energy for validation purposes. The effects of pro-fault loading and arcing impedance on the predicted fault current values were also investigated. Then, to ensure that the validated software tools are indeed capable of analyzing circuits with DCs, fault management and relay protection problems were developed and solved using a modified IEEE 34-bus feeder with addition of DCs.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2005.1560529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33135","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","pdfPath":"/iel5/10440/33135/01560529.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th Annual North American Power Symposium, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 37th Annual North American Power Symposium, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2005.1560529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault analysis study using modeling and simulation tools for distribution power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Power system simulation","Analytical models","Power system analysis computing","Power system faults","Circuit faults","Software tools","Distributed control","Circuit simulation","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution faults","power distribution protection","power engineering computing","fault diagnosis","software tools","power system management","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution power systems","simulation tools","fault analysis","modeling tools","software tools","recorded fault data","real circuit system","Detroit Edison Energy","profault loading","arcing impedance","fault management","relay protection problems","modified IEEE 34-bus feeder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fault analysis study using modeling and simulation tools for distribution power systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560529/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560529/","accessionNumber":"8706510","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"25-25 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault analysis study using modeling and simulation tools for distribution power systems","confLoc":"Ames, IA, USA","sourcePdf":"01560529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06249S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10440","isNumber":"33135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33135","articleId":"1560529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1560640,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The partial discharge test is a nondestructive method of identifying possible premature insulation breakdown. Magnet wires are used in various electrical equipments like injection coils, solenoids and small transformers. The aging process of the wire insulation was achieved through the application of high voltages, high temperature and high frequency. The tests were conducted for AWG 30 and AWG 31 twisted magnet wire samples. A high level of stress is present within several turns of coil windings. This paper is focused on the study of partial discharge patterns for magnet wire insulation. The partial discharge inception voltages (PDIV) are measured for different twisted wire samples. An evaluation of the parameters charge intensity, pulse count, and pulse phase position are presented in 2- and 3-dimensional plots.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Wire","Voltage","Stress","Power transformer insulation","Coils","Cable insulation","Insulation testing","Nondestructive testing","Electric breakdown"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge measurement","nondestructive testing","ageing","insulated wires","twisted pair cables","voltage measurement","electric breakdown","high-voltage techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge test","voltage stress","high voltage system","nondestructive method","premature insulation breakdown","electrical equipment","injection coil","solenoid","transformer","aging process","wire insulation","AWG 30 twisted magnet wire","AWG 31 twisted magnet wire","coil winding","partial discharge inception voltage measurement","charge intensity","pulse phase position"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2005.1560710","publicationTitle":"CEIDP '05. 2005 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"CEIDP '05. 2005 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10441/33136/01560710.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2005.1560710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial discharge patterns of magnet wire samples under voltage stresses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1560710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Partial discharge patterns of magnet wire samples under voltage stresses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560710/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560710/","accessionNumber":"8789040","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial discharge patterns of magnet wire samples under voltage stresses","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01560710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033342S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10441","isNumber":"33136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10441","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33136","articleId":"1560710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1560726,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A transformer model can be viewed as a functional approximator constructing an input-output mapping between specific variables and the terminal behaviors of the transformer. A neural network system is proposed to implement the entire approximating task by taking the advantage of its self learning and highly non-linear mapping capability. Two kinds of neural networks, back propagation feed forward network (BPFN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) were investigated to model the faults in power transformers. A voltage impulse of 1 kV is applied at the HV terminal and different types of fault conditions are simulated using PSPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) and thus the data generated is used for training and testing the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2005.1560754","startPage":"601","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"CEIDP '05. 2005 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2005.1560754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33136","displayPublicationTitle":"CEIDP '05. 2005 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10441/33136/01560754.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling transformer internal short circuit faults using neural network techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1560754/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling transformer internal short circuit faults using neural network techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1560754/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8789082","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling transformer internal short circuit faults using neural network techniques","confLoc":"Nashville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"01560754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033815S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10441","isNumber":"33136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10441","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33136","articleId":"1560754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1560757,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The subspace mixture model in the feature space and its corresponding GLRT expression are equivalent to a nonlinear subspace mixture model with a corresponding nonlinear GLRT expression in the original input space. In order to address the intractability of the GLRT in the feature space, we kernelize the GLRT expression using the kernel eigenvector representations as well as the kernel trick where dot products in the feature space are implicitly computed by kernels. The proposed kernel-based nonlinear detector, so-called kernel matched subspace detector (KMSD), is applied to several hyperspectral images to detect targets of interest. KMSD showed superior detection performance over the conventional MSD when tested on several synthetic data and real hyperspectral imagery.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel matched subspace detectors for hyperspectral target detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.39","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33140/01561179.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Kernel matched subspace detectors for hyperspectral target detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1561179/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8935235","pubMedId":"16468616","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel matched subspace detectors for hyperspectral target detection","sourcePdf":"01561179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031725S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","isNumber":"33140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"91","articleId":"1561179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561183,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

The idea is to start with a set of images and make them appear as similar as possible by removing variability along the known axes of variation. This technique can be used to eliminate \"nuisance\" variables such as affine deformations from handwritten digits or unwanted bias fields from magnetic resonance images. In addition to separating and modeling the latent images - i.e., the images without the nuisance variables - we can model the nuisance variables themselves, leading to factorized generative image models. When nuisance variable distributions are shared between classes, one can share the knowledge learned in one task with another task, leading to efficient learning. We demonstrate this process by building a handwritten digit classifier from just a single example of each class. In addition to applications in handwritten character recognition, we describe in detail the application of bias removal from magnetic resonance images. Unlike previous methods, we use a separate, nonparametric model for the intensity values at each pixel. This allows us to leverage the data from the MR images of different patients to remove bias from each other. Only very weak assumptions are made about the distributions of intensity values in the images. In addition to the digit and MR applications, we discuss a number of other uses of congealing and describe experiments about the robustness and consistency of the method.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/33140/01561183.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven image models through continuous joint alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561183/","displayDocTitle":"Data driven image models through continuous joint alignment","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8935239","pubMedId":"16468620","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561183/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven image models through continuous joint alignment","sourcePdf":"01561183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062962S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"33140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"33140","articleId":"1561183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561189,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Single carrier with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) is a closely related transmission scheme that possesses most of the benefits of OFDM but does not have the PAPR problem. Although in a multipath environment, SC-CP is very robust to frequency-selective fading, it is sensitive to the time-selective fading characteristics of the wireless channel that disturbs the orthogonality of the channel matrix (CM) and increases the computational complexity of the receiver. In this paper, we propose a time-domain low-complexity iterative algorithm to compensate for the effects of time selectivity of the channel that exploits the sparsity present in the channel convolution matrix.

Using a network model based on fluid approximations and through a realistic modeling of queues, we establish the existence of a unique equilibrium as well as its global asymptotic stability for a general network topology, where boundary effects are also taken into account. We also provide sufficient conditions for system stability when there is a bottleneck link shared by multiple users experiencing nonnegligible communication delays. In addition, we study an adaptive pricing scheme using hybrid systems concepts. Based on these theoretical foundations, we implement a window-based, end-to-end congestion control scheme, and simulate it in ns-2 network simulator on various network topologies with sizable propagation delays.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2005.860099","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33142/01561222.pdf","startPage":"1261","endPage":"1274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.860099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A globally stable adaptive congestion control scheme for Internet-style networks with delay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561222/","displayDocTitle":"A globally stable adaptive congestion control scheme for Internet-style networks with delay","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701207","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561222/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A globally stable adaptive congestion control scheme for Internet-style networks with delay","sourcePdf":"01561222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142236S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"33142","articleId":"1561222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1561225,"authors":[{"name":"Shengming Jiang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/33142/1561225/1561225-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengming Jiang (A'96\u2013M'00) received the B.Eng degree from the Shanghai Maritime Institute, China, in 1988, and the DEA and Dr. degrees from the University of Paris VI and the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, France, in 1992 and 1995, respectively.","From 1988 to 1990, he was with Nanjing Petrol Transportation Company, China.

One critical issue for routing in MANETs is how to select reliable paths that can last as long as possible since terminal mobility may cause radio links to be broken frequently. To solve this problem, a criterion that can judge path reliability is needed. The reliability of a path depends on the number of links and the reliability of each link constituting the path. Many routing metrics in terms of number of links have been proposed, such as the shortest path routing. However, how to measure link availability or reliability in order to find more reliable paths has not been addressed adequately in the literature. (By a link being available, we mean that the radio quality of the link satisfies the minimum requirement for successful communication. Link availability is used to measure probability or degree that a link is available. The terms availability and reliability are used interchangeable in this paper.) This paper first introduces a prediction-based link availability estimation to quantify the link reliability. This quantity makes use of some instantly available information and also considers the dynamic nature of link status in order to properly reflect the link reliability. Then, this quantity has been further used to develop routing metrics for path selection in terms of path reliability to improve routing performances. The proposed schemes have been investigated through computer simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2005.860094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33142","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1312","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/33142/01561225.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A prediction-based link availability estimation for routing metrics in MANETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561225/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A prediction-based link availability estimation for routing metrics in MANETs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701210","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A prediction-based link availability estimation for routing metrics in MANETs","sourcePdf":"01561225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085622S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"33142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"33142","articleId":"1561225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1561227,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Our main focus lies on the drivers typically found in embedded SRAMs. Much work has been done for variable tapered buffer design explicitly targeting energy (and/or area) tradeoffs for a given target delay. In contrast, the formalized techniques presented here are capable of providing all existing Pareto configurations achieving optimal energy/delay tradeoffs, and this is applicable for the full range of all possible delay constraints. Based on such techniques, a transistor-level implementation is also presented to allow a discrete set of Pareto configurations (from high-speed to low-energy) to be selected at run-time. This implementation has been validated via SPICE simulations for a 65-nm CMOS technology, confirming that a very wide range in delay (more than a factor 2) and energy consumption (up to 40%) can be achieved at the SRAM level, including process variability impact effects present in CMOS nanometer technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/33143/01561242.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Variable tapered pareto buffer design and implementation allowing run-time configuration for low-power embedded SRAMs","volume":"13","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8701288","htmlLink":"/document/1561242/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable tapered pareto buffer design and implementation allowing run-time configuration for low-power embedded SRAMs","sourcePdf":"01561242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09144S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33143","articleId":"1561242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561245,"authors":[{"name":"V.

While lower threshold voltages increase leakage, lower supply voltages and smaller nodal capacitances reduce energy consumption but increase soft errors rates. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of soft error rates on low-power cache design. First, we study the effect of circuit level techniques, used to reduce the leakage energy consumption, on soft error rates. Our results using custom designs show that many of these approaches may increase the soft error rates as compared to a standard 6T SRAM. We also validate the effects of voltage scaling on soft error rate by performing accelerated tests on off-the-shelf SRAM-based chips using a neutron beam source. Next, we study the impact of cache decay and drowsy cache, which are two commonly used architectural-level leakage reduction approaches, on the cache reliability. Our results indicate that the leakage optimization techniques change the reliability of cache memory. More importantly, we demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between optimizing for leakage power and improving the immunity to soft error. We also study the impact of error correcting codes on soft error rates. Based on this study, we propose an adaptive error correcting scheme to reduce the leakage energy consumption and improve reliability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/33143/01561245.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859474","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft errors issues in low-power caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561245/","displayDocTitle":"Soft errors issues in low-power caches","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561245/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"8701291","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft errors issues in low-power caches","sourcePdf":"01561245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080567S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"33143","articleId":"1561245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561247,"authors":[{"name":"Z.K.

This paper describes a novel systolic array-based string matching architecture using a buffered, two-comparator variation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm. The architecture compares favorably with the state-of-the-art hardwired designs while providing on-the-fly reconfiguration, efficient hardware utilization, and high clock rates. KMP is a well-known computationally efficient string-matching technique that uses a single comparator and a precomputed transition table. Through the use of the transition table, the number of redundant comparisons performed is reduced. Through various algorithmic changes, we enable KMP to be used in hardware, providing the computational efficiency of the serial algorithm and the high throughput of a parallel hardware architecture. The efficiency of the system allows for a faster and denser implementation than any other RAM-based exact match system. We add a second comparator and an input buffer and then prove that the modified algorithm can function efficiently implemented as an element of a systolic array. The system can accept at least one character in each cycle while guaranteeing that the stream will never stall. In this paper, we prove the bound on the buffer size and running time of the systolic array, discuss the architectural considerations involved in the FPGA implementation, and provide performance comparisons against other approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561247/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701293","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient engine for flexible intrusion detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient engine for flexible intrusion detection","sourcePdf":"01561247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067152S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33143","articleId":"1561247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1561249,"authors":[{"name":"Daihyun Lim","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Daihyun Lim","id":"37273969600"},{"name":"J.W.

It is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and some other music-related applications. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is presented to automate the task of mood detection from acoustic music data, by following some music psychological theories in western cultures. The hierarchical framework has the advantage of emphasizing the most suitable features in different detection tasks. Three feature sets, including intensity, timbre, and rhythm are extracted to represent the characteristics of a music clip. The intensity feature set is represented by the energy in each subband, the timbre feature set is composed of the spectral shape features and spectral contrast features, and the rhythm feature set indicates three aspects that are closely related with an individual's mood response, including rhythm strength, rhythm regularity, and tempo. Furthermore, since mood is usually changeable in an entire piece of classical music, the approach to mood detection is extended to mood tracking for a music piece, by dividing the music into several independent segments, each of which contains a homogeneous emotional expression.

In this paper, we present a subset selection step to reduce the computational complexity of these methods, which then enables us to use the sparse coding approach for many real world applications.

The method exploits a priori information about speech and noise spectral shapes stored in trained codebooks, parameterized as linear predictive coefficients. The method also uses information about noise statistics estimated from the noisy observation. Maximum-likelihood estimates of the speech and noise short-term predictor parameters are obtained by searching for the combination of codebook entries that optimizes the likelihood. The estimation involves the computation of the excitation variances of the speech and noise auto-regressive models on a frame-by-frame basis, using the a priori information and the noisy observation. The high computational complexity resulting from a full search of the joint speech and noise codebooks is avoided through an iterative optimization procedure. We introduce a classified noise codebook scheme that uses different noise codebooks for different noise types. Experimental results show that the use of a priori information and the calculation of the instantaneous speech and noise excitation variances on a frame-by-frame basis result in good performance in both stationary and nonstationary noise conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.854113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33144/01561274.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.854113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codebook driven short-term predictor parameter estimation for speech enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561274/","displayDocTitle":"Codebook driven short-term predictor parameter estimation for speech enhancement","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8712021","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561274/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codebook driven short-term predictor parameter estimation for speech enhancement","sourcePdf":"01561274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0979S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"33144","articleId":"1561274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1561276,"authors":[{"name":"L.

To compensate for packet loss a number of techniques are investigated to provide estimates of lost vectors. Experimental results on both a connected digits task and a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task show that simple methods, such as repetition, are not as effective as interpolation methods which are better able to preserve the dynamics of the feature vector stream. Best performance is given by maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation of lost vectors which utilizes statistics of the feature vector stream. At longer burst lengths the performance of these compensation techniques deteriorates as the temporal correlation in the received feature vector stream reduces. To compensate for this interleaving is proposed which aims to disperse bursts of loss into a series of unconnected smaller bursts. Results show substantial gains in accuracy, to almost that of the no loss condition, when interleaving is combined with estimation techniques, although this is at the expense of introducing delay. This leads to the proposal that, for a distributed speech recognition application, it is more beneficial to trade delay for accuracy rather than trading bit-rate for accuracy as in forward error correction schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.852997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33144/01561279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.852997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33144","startPage":"223","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust speech recognition over mobile and IP networks in burst-like packet loss","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust speech recognition over mobile and IP networks in burst-like packet loss","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8712026","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561279/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speech recognition over mobile and IP networks in burst-like packet loss","sourcePdf":"01561279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080341S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33144","articleId":"1561279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1561281,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

In this paper, we focus on sequential organization in cochannel speech, or mixtures of two voices. We extract minimally corrupted segments, or usable speech, in cochannel speech using a robust multipitch tracking algorithm. The extracted usable speech is shown to capture speaker characteristics and improves speaker identification (SID) performance across various target-to-interferer ratios. To utilize speaker characteristics for sequential organization, we extend the traditional SID framework to cochannel speech and derive a joint objective for sequential grouping and SID, leading to a problem of search for the optimum hypothesis. Subsequently we propose a hypothesis pruning algorithm based on speaker models in order to make the search computationally efficient. Evaluation results show that the proposed system approaches the ceiling SID performance obtained with prior pitch information and yields significant improvement over alternative approaches to sequential organization.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.854106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33144/01561285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.854106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33144","startPage":"289","endPage":"298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based sequential organization in cochannel speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-based sequential organization in cochannel speech","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8712032","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561285/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based sequential organization in cochannel speech","sourcePdf":"01561285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075293S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"33144","articleId":"1561285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1561288,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Here, context recognition refers to the automatic classification of the context or an environment around a device. A system is developed and compared to the accuracy of human listeners in the same task. Particular emphasis is placed on the computational complexity of the methods, since the application is of particular interest in resource-constrained portable devices. Simplistic low-dimensional feature vectors are evaluated against more standard spectral features. Using discriminative training, competitive recognition accuracies are achieved with very low-order hidden Markov models (1-3 Gaussian components). Slight improvement in recognition accuracy is observed when linear data-driven feature transformations are applied to mel-cepstral features. The recognition rate of the system as a function of the test sequence length appears to converge only after about 30 to 60 s. Some degree of accuracy can be achieved even with less than 1-s test sequence lengths. The average reaction time of the human listeners was 14 s, i.e., somewhat smaller, but of the same order as that of the system. The average recognition accuracy of the system was 58% against 69%, obtained in the listening tests in recognizing between 24 everyday contexts. The accuracies in recognizing six high-level classes were 82% for the system and 88% for the subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561288/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8712035","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Audio-based context recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio-based context recognition","sourcePdf":"01561288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119687S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"33144","articleId":"1561288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561290,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The analysis is performed jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. Acoustic signals from arbitrary musical genres are considered. For the initial time-frequency analysis, a new technique is proposed which measures the degree of musical accent as a function of time at four different frequency ranges. This is followed by a bank of comb filter resonators which extracts features for estimating the periods and phases of the three pulses. The features are processed by a probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and uses the low-level observations to perform joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses. The model takes into account the temporal dependencies between successive estimates and enables both causal and noncausal analysis. The method is validated using a manually annotated database of 474 music signals from various genres. The method works robustly for different types of music and improves over two state-of-the-art reference methods in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSA.2005.854090","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/33144/01561290.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSA.2005.854090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the meter of acoustic musical signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the meter of acoustic musical signals","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8712037","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1561290/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the meter of acoustic musical signals","sourcePdf":"01561290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071826S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"33144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"33144","articleId":"1561290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":1561301,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Analysis of standard MMF in an overfilled launch demonstrates that the theoretical bandwidth limitations arise from the influence of cladding on the propagation of the highest order modes. Practical MMF profile designs that overcome this problem are investigated. The standard 50- and 62.5-/spl mu/m fiber profiles are redesigned first to allow for the performance in an overfilled launch with the differential mode delays (DMDs) below 0.055 and 0.250 ns/km, respectively. It is shown that such fibers can exhibit the same or better theoretical bandwidth in an overfilled launch when compared to standard fiber under restricted launch. Elimination of the need for the restricted mode launch in high-performance multimode transmission systems can improve reliability issues and can relax the range of tolerance requirements imposed on terminal equipment, optical components, and link installation. Furthermore, MMFs that can be operated in an overfilled launched are compatible with emerging vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) array technologies. A successfully controlled higher order mode DMD also allows for the reduction of MMF core size and /spl Delta/ that can be beneficial for low-cost high-performance single-channel links. It is demonstrated that properly designed reduced core fibers can achieve theoretical DMDs in the range of 0.005-0.02 ns/km. The bend loss properties of redesigned fibers are investigated in detail, showing that the proposed modifications do not lead to significant degradation of bend loss performance. Moreover, they can be manufactured at considerably lower cost while utilizing commercially readily available low-cost VCSELs. Even where the theoretical limit is not achieved by practical fiber making, the reduced core size and /spl Delta/ MMF can provide higher production yield, lower cost, and higher average bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.855875","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33146/01561382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.855875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33146","startPage":"3526","endPage":"3540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunities to enhance multimode fiber links by application of overfilled launch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunities to enhance multimode fiber links by application of overfilled launch","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8693462","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561382/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunities to enhance multimode fiber links by application of overfilled launch","sourcePdf":"01561382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183656S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33146","articleId":"1561382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561389,"authors":[{"name":"K.

From the Raman-gain spectrum, information is derived related to the nonlinear refractive index due to nuclear motions and the Raman response function in the time domain. It is demonstrated that the Raman-gain coefficient may be reduced up to 60% if the signal propagates in the fundamental mode while the pump alternates between the fundamental mode and a higher order mode. A simple model shows that the time response related to the decay of phonons is significantly larger in germanate glass relative to silica glass.

To support multimedia services with different bit-rate requirements, a new family of multiple-length constant-weight ECHPCs with ideal correlation properties is constructed algebraically in this paper. The performance of these new codes in an O-CDMA multimedia system is analyzed. Contrary to conventional single-length codes, our study shows that the performance of these multiple-length codes improves as the code length decreases, thus supporting prioritization in O-CDMA.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.857731","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33146/01561394.pdf","startPage":"3653","endPage":"3662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.857731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-length extended carrier-hopping prime codes for optical CDMA systems supporting multirate multimedia services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561394/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-length extended carrier-hopping prime codes for optical CDMA systems supporting multirate multimedia services","volume":"23","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8693474","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561394/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-length extended carrier-hopping prime codes for optical CDMA systems supporting multirate multimedia services","sourcePdf":"01561394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081687S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"33146","articleId":"1561394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561398,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, the number of different LDPC codes of code rate above 0.8 is rather small. As a natural extension of the prior work, in this paper, we consider LDPC codes on m flats derived from projective and affine geometries, which outperform codes from finite planes. The codes on m flats also provide a greater selection of structured LDPC codes of rate 0.8 or higher. The performance of the codes in a long-haul optical-communication system was assessed using an advanced simulator able to capture all important transmission impairments. Specifically, they achieve a coding gain of 10 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -9/, outperforming, therefore, the best turbo product codes proposed for optical communications. In addition, the simulator implements a fixed-point (FP) iterative decoder that allows control of the precision of the soft information used in the decoder. Such quantization is required to facilitate hardware implementations of the iterative decoder, and the high-speed operations for long-haul optical transmission systems. The loss in performance due to reduced precision of the soft information can be as low as 0.2 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.857736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.857736","startPage":"3696","endPage":"3701","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33146/01561398.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iteratively decodable codes on m flats for WDM high-speed long-haul transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Iteratively decodable codes on m flats for WDM high-speed long-haul transmission","volume":"23","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8693478","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561398/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iteratively decodable codes on m flats for WDM high-speed long-haul transmission","sourcePdf":"01561398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076149S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33146","articleId":"1561398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1561400,"authors":[{"name":"G.Z.

At a different bias, a record f/sub max/ of 230 GHz was obtained.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2005.860882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/33147/01561440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2005.860882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33147","startPage":"13","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors with InGaN back-barriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors with InGaN back-barriers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727410","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561440/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors with InGaN back-barriers","sourcePdf":"01561440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050616S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"33147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"33147","articleId":"1561440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1561442,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The numerical results show that the proposed NGA approach obtains a near-optimal layout of the organization, i.e., the assignment of platforms to tasks and the patterns of coordination achieve a nice tradeoff between inter-DM and intra-DM coordination workload.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2006.859106","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/33148/01561470.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2006.859106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel congruent organizational design methodology using group technology and a nested genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel congruent organizational design methodology using group technology and a nested genetic algorithm","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8941219","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1561470/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel congruent organizational design methodology using group technology and a nested genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"01561470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116967S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"33148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"33148","articleId":"1561470","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1561480,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We develop a new cost function which accounts for the data-dependent nature of jitter noise based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Using the step-response-based channel model, we derive expressions for the statistics required to compute the optimum equalizer and target in the presence of jitter noise. We also derive a bit-response-based model for the jitter noise channel. We present an approach for doing simulations as well as analytical computations for the jitter noise channel without resorting to the widely used Taylor series approximations. Our computational and simulation results show that, while the targets designed without accounting for the jitter lead to error-floor effect in the bit-error-rate performance, the targets designed by our approach give significant performance improvement under high jitter conditions, with no sign of error-floor effect for the range of signal-to-noise ratios considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/33149/01561503.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2005.860308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2005.860308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of optimum partial response target and equalizer for recording channels with jitter noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Jitter","Computational modeling","Signal design","Ground penetrating radar","Perpendicular magnetic recording","Cost function","Mean square error methods","Statistics","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perpendicular magnetic recording","equalisers","circuit noise","least mean squares methods","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum partial response target","recording channel equalizer","jitter noise","minimum mean square error criterion","step-response-based channel model","optimum equalizer computation","analytical computations","Taylor series approximations","error-floor effect","bit-error-rate performance","high jitter conditions","signal-to-noise ratios","partial response target design","perpendicular magnetic recording","transition jitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Media noise","partial response target design","perpendicular magnetic recording","transition jitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Joint design of optimum partial response target and equalizer for recording channels with jitter noise","volume":"42","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1561503/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8695664","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint design of optimum partial response target and equalizer for recording channels with jitter noise","sourcePdf":"01561503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06483S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"33149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33149","articleId":"1561503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561506,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the current paper, a detailed mathematical analysis of the coupling between the different parallel feedback loops is carried out. From this analysis, results are derived pertaining to system dynamics and jitter variance. Furthermore, a novel operating mode, called improved decision-directed (IDD), is proposed as an improvement of the standard decision-directed (DD) mode. The resulting performance will be measured in terms of mean-square estimation errors (MSEEs) and benchmarked against the corresponding modified Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bounds (MCRBs).

This paper concentrates on this last application of diagonal loading techniques, i.e., it is assumed that the steering vector is perfectly known and that diagonal loading is used to alleviate the finite sample size impairments. The analysis herein is asymptotic in the sense that it is assumed that both the number of antennas and the number of samples are high but have the same order of magnitude. Borrowing some results of random matrix theory, the authors first derive a deterministic expression that describes the asymptotic signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) at the output of the diagonally loaded beamformer. Then, making use of the statistical theory of large observations (also known as general statistical analysis or G-analysis), the authors derive an estimator of the optimum loading factor that is consistent when both the number of antennas and the sample size increase without bound at the same rate. Because of that, the estimator has an excellent performance even in situations where the quotient between the number of observations is low relative to the number of elements of the array.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561576.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite sample size effect on minimum variance beamformers: optimum diagonal loading factor for large arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial filters","Sensor arrays","Radar applications","Signal design","Calibration","Array signal processing","Signal processing","Degradation","Phased arrays","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","antenna theory","statistical analysis","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite sample size effect","minimum variance beamformers","diagonal loading factor","large arrays","steering vector","random matrix theory","asymptotic signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diagonal loading","G-estimation","minimum variance distortionless beamformer (MVDR)","random matrix theory","sample matrix inversion algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Finite sample size effect on minimum variance beamformers: optimum diagonal loading factor for large arrays","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1561576/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699888","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite sample size effect on minimum variance beamformers: optimum diagonal loading factor for large arrays","sourcePdf":"01561576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093692S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1561578,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

However, there is no literature on its convergence analysis. Further, existing analyses of the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm assume that the input signals are jointly Gaussian, an assumption that is invalid for PR equalization with binary input. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze the convergence of the LCLMS algorithm, without the Gaussian assumption. Our approach accommodates distinct step sizes for equalizer and PR target. It is shown that the step-size range required to guarantee stability of LCLMS with binary data is larger than that with Gaussian data. The analytical results are corroborated by extensive simulation studies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Equalizers","Least squares approximation","Algorithm design and analysis","Optical recording","Signal analysis","Magnetic recording","Viterbi algorithm","Optical noise","Memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","partial response channels","adaptive signal processing","equalisers","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence analysis","constrained joint adaptation","recording channels","partial response equalization","linearly constrained least-mean-square adaptive algorithm","Gaussian data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constrained joint adaptation","least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm","partial response (PR) equalization","recording channels"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561578.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis of constrained joint adaptation in recording channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convergence analysis of constrained joint adaptation in recording channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561578/","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561578/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8699890","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence analysis of constrained joint adaptation in recording channels","sourcePdf":"01561578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068752S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1561580,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

As the observation time, T, is fixed and finite, the variance of estimated autocorrelation and continuous-time parameter does not vanish as /spl Delta/ approaches 0. This necessitates a second-order Taylor expansion in deriving the parameter estimator bias and variance. The second-order Taylor expansion produces better bias and variance results than a first-order one does. The distribution of the estimator is also discussed. According to the gradient change of the variance, a key result is that three sample size regions, which are termed finite, large, and very large, corresponding to substantial, gradual, and very slight decrease in the variance of the parameter estimator, respectively, are quantified. In terms of analysis BW, the three regions are (-23,-35),(-35,-55), and (-55,-/spl infin/) dB. The characterization of the tradeoff between the variance decrease and sampling rate results in a practical guideline for choosing sampling rate.

Using a complete parameterization of FIR PU systems in terms of Householder-like building blocks, an iterative algorithm is proposed that is greedy in the sense that the observed mean-squared error at each iteration is guaranteed to not increase. For certain design problems in which there is a phase-type ambiguity in the desired response, which is formally defined in the paper, a phase feedback modification is proposed in which the phase of the FIR approximant is fed back to the desired response. With this modification in effect, it is shown that the resulting iterative algorithm not only still remains greedy, but also offers a better magnitude-type fit to the desired response. Simulation results show the usefulness and versatility of the proposed algorithm with respect to the design of principal component filter bank (PCFB)-like filter banks and the FIR PU interpolation problem. Concerning the PCFB design problem, it is shown that as the McMillan degree of the FIR PU approximant increases, the resulting filter bank behaves more and more like the infinite-order PCFB, consistent with intuition. In particular, this PCFB-like behavior is shown in terms of filter response shape, multiresolution, coding gain, noise reduction with zeroth-order Wiener filtering in the subbands, and power minimization for discrete multitone (DMT)-type transmultiplexers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","volume":"54","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8699895","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561583/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iterative greedy algorithm for solving the FIR paraunitary approximation problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative greedy algorithm for solving the FIR paraunitary approximation problem","sourcePdf":"01561583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110615S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1561584,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the second, the worst case SINR is maximized subject to a power constraint. It is shown that both problems can be solved using standard conic optimization packages. In addition, conditions are developed for the optimal precoder for both of these problems, and two simple fixed-point iterations are proposed to find the solutions that satisfy these conditions. The relation to the well-known uplink-downlink duality in the context of joint transmit beamforming and power control is also explored. The proposed precoder design is general, and as a special case, it solves the transmit rank-one beamforming problem.

In order to satisfy the growing demand for higher data rates, one possible solution is to exploit both spatial and multipath diversities via the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and proper coding techniques. In this paper, we propose a general framework to analyze the performance of multiband UWB-MIMO systems regardless of specific coding schemes. A combination of space-time-frequency (STF) coding and hopping multiband OFDM modulation is also proposed to fully exploit all of the available spatial and frequency diversities, richly inherent in UWB environments. We quantify the performance merits of the proposed scheme in case of Nakagami-m frequency-selective fading channels. Different from the conventional STF coded MIMO-OFDM system, the performance of the STF coded hopping multiband UWB does not depend on the temporal correlation of the propagation channel. We show that the maximum achievable diversity of multiband UWB-MIMO system is the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of multipath components, and the number of jointly encoded OFDM symbols. Interestingly, the diversity gain does not severely depend on the fading parameter m, and the diversity advantage obtained under Nakagami fading with arbitrary m parameter is almost the same as that obtained in Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","startPage":"214","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiband-OFDM MIMO coding framework for UWB communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiband-OFDM MIMO coding framework for UWB communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699900","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiband-OFDM MIMO coding framework for UWB communication systems","sourcePdf":"01561588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047647S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"73","articleId":"1561588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561589,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In terms of z transform, if the received signal is multiplied by the inverse of the transmitted signal, the resulting z transform renders the channel transfer function when additive noise is absent in the channel. For an FIR channel, samples of the recovered impulse response must be zero in the region of zeros of the channel impulse response. Based on this observation, the blind estimation problem is formulated as a solution of linear equations, treating the transmitted symbols as unknown variables. Polynomial residue arithmetic turns out to be very useful for deriving the linear equations.

There are two alternative design objectives: minimizing the trace of the error correlation matrix and thus minimizing the mean-squared error, or minimizing the determinant of the error correlation matrix and thus maximizing information rate. It is shown that a solution to both problems is to first transform the noisy observations into canonical coordinates, quantize and apply a Wiener filter in this coordinate system, and then transform the result back to the original coordinates. Canonical coordinates are uncorrelated, and quantization and Wiener filtering are applied to each component independently. The type of canonical coordinate system depends on the design objective: Quantization in half-canonical coordinates minimizes the mean-squared error and quantization in full-canonical coordinates maximizes information rate. Finally, it is also demonstrated in this paper that majorization is the fundamental principle underlying proofs of optimal transform coding.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561590.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"243","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Canonical coordinates for transform coding of noisy sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Canonical coordinates for transform coding of noisy sources","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1561590/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699902","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical coordinates for transform coding of noisy sources","sourcePdf":"01561590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118888S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561599,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We develop explicit Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the azimuth and elevation angles that show a simple structure. In particular, for a fixed elevation angle, the CRBs are cosine functions of the source azimuth, and so, regardless of the array geometry. The amplitude and extremes of these functions depend on the array geometry. Hence, the array configuration can be chosen in order to ensure a desired (an)isotropic behavior. To do so, we propose a pragmatic methodology that also takes into account the array ambiguity problem. The array design problem is simplified by limiting the array search within a family of V-shaped arrays that are advantageously characterized by a single parameter, the angle between the two branches. A performance measure is proposed, then analytically expressed, to assess the array directivity and gain with respect to the more standardly used uniform circular array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cramer-Rao bounds for antenna array design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561599.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Cramer-Rao bounds for antenna array design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1561599/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699911","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cramer-Rao bounds for antenna array design","sourcePdf":"01561599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096998S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561600,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The objective is to design the transmitter according to an imperfect channel estimate, where the errors are explicitly taken into account to obtain a robust design under the maximin or worst case philosophy. The robust transmission scheme is composed of an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), whose outputs are transmitted through the eigenmodes of the channel estimate with an appropriate power allocation among them. At the receiver, the signal is detected assuming a perfect channel knowledge. The optimization problem corresponding to the design of the power allocation among the estimated eigenmodes, whose goal is the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is transformed to a simple convex problem that can be easily solved. Different sources of errors are considered in the channel estimate, such as the Gaussian noise from the estimation process and the errors from the quantization of the channel estimate, among others. For the case of Gaussian noise, the robust power allocation admits a closed-form expression. Finally, the benefits of the proposed design are evaluated and compared with the pure OSTBC and nonrobust approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561600.pdf","startPage":"346","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust maximin approach for MIMO communications with imperfect channel state information based on convex optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561600/","displayDocTitle":"A robust maximin approach for MIMO communications with imperfect channel state information based on convex optimization","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699912","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561600/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust maximin approach for MIMO communications with imperfect channel state information based on convex optimization","sourcePdf":"01561600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112811S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561601,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Recently, a simpler statistical model, namely, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), was also shown to perform well. In much of the literature devoted to these models, the experiments were performed with controlled images (manual face localization, controlled lighting, background, pose, etc). However, a practical recognition system has to be robust to more challenging conditions. In this article we evaluate, on the relatively difficult BANCA database, the performance, robustness and complexity of GMM and HMM-based approaches, using both manual and automatic face localization. We extend the GMM approach through the use of local features with embedded positional information, increasing performance without sacrificing its low complexity. Furthermore, we show that the traditionally used maximum likelihood (ML) training approach has problems estimating robust model parameters when there is only a few training images available. Considerably more precise models can be obtained through the use of Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) training. We also show that face recognition techniques which obtain good performance on manually located faces do not necessarily obtain good performance on automatically located faces, indicating that recognition techniques must be designed from the ground up to handle imperfect localization. Finally, we show that while the pseudo-2-D HMM approach has the best overall performance, authentication time on current hardware makes it impractical. The best tradeoff in terms of authentication time, robustness and discrimination performance is achieved by the extended GMM approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33152/01561601.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User authentication via adapted statistical models of face images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Hidden Markov models","Robustness","Face recognition","Automatic control","Lighting control","Maximum likelihood estimation","Image databases","Spatial databases","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","face recognition","hidden Markov models","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user authentication","adapted statistical model","face images","one-dimensional hidden Markov models","pseudo-two-dimensional hidden Markov models","Gaussian mixture model","face recognition system","face localization","maximum likelihood training approach","maximum a posteriori probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access control","biometrics","face localization","face recognition","hidden Markov models (HMMs)","Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)","local features","maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"User authentication via adapted statistical models of face images","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1561601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8699913","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User authentication via adapted statistical models of face images","sourcePdf":"01561601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093696S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561603,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The design of such filter banks has been shown in the literature to consist of the design of an optimal FIR compaction filter followed by an appropriate Karhunen-Loe/spl grave/ve transform (KLT). Despite this elegant construction, EC optimal filter banks have been shown to perform worse than common nonadapted filter banks for coding gain, contrary to intuition. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon is most likely due to the nonuniqueness of the compaction filter in terms of its spectral factors. This nonuniqueness results in a finite set of EC optimal filter banks. By choosing the spectral factor yielding the largest coding gain, it is shown that the resulting filter bank behaves more and more like the infinite-order principal components filter bank (PCFB) in terms of numerous objectives such as coding gain, multiresolution, noise reduction with zeroth-order Wiener filters in the subbands, and power minimization for discrete multitone (DMT)-type nonredundant transmultiplexers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8699915","htmlLink":"/document/1561603/","displayDocTitle":"On the spectral factor ambiguity of FIR energy compaction filter Banks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the spectral factor ambiguity of FIR energy compaction filter Banks","sourcePdf":"01561603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082412S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33152","articleId":"1561603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1561621,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

The recent advancements in ultrasound instrumentation and portable ultrasound devices necessitate the need of more robust despeckling techniques for enhanced ultrasound medical imaging for both routine clinical practice and teleconsultation. The objective of this work was to carry out a comparative evaluation of despeckle filtering based on texture analysis, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual evaluation by medical experts in the assessment of 440 (220 asymptomatic and 220 symptomatic) ultrasound images of the carotid artery bifurcation. In this paper a total of 10 despeckle filters were evaluated based on local statistics, median filtering, pixel homogeneity, geometric filtering, homomorphic filtering, anisotropic diffusion, nonlinear coherence diffusion, and wavelet filtering. The results of this study suggest that the first order statistics filter lsmv, gave the best performance, followed by the geometric filter gf4d, and the homogeneous mask area filter lsminsc. These filters improved the class separation between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic classes based on the statistics of the extracted texture features, gave only a marginal improvement in the classification success rate, and improved the visual assessment carried out by the two experts. More specifically, filters lsmv or gf4d can be used for despeckling asymptomatic images in which the expert is interested mainly in the plaque composition and texture analysis; and filters lsmv, gf4d, or lsminsc can be used for the despeckling of symptomatic images in which the expert is interested in identifying the degree of stenosis and the plaque borders. The proper selection of a despeckle filter is very important in the enhancement of ultrasonic imaging of the carotid artery. Further work is needed to evaluate at a larger scale and in clinical practice the performance of the proposed despeckle filters in the automated segmentation, texture analysis, and classification of carotid ultrasound imaging.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33153/01561621.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative evaluation of despeckle filtering in ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparative evaluation of despeckle filtering in ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561621/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","volume":"52","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561621/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8666020","pubMedId":"16382618","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative evaluation of despeckle filtering in ultrasound imaging of the carotid artery","sourcePdf":"1561621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129501S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"33153","articleId":"1561621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":1561624,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is one modality using standard diagnostic ultrasound scanners to generate localized, impulsive, acoustic radiation forces in tissue. The dynamic response of tissue is measured via conventional ultrasonic speckle-tracking methods and provides information about the mechanical properties of tissue. A finite-element method (FEM) model has been developed that simulates the dynamic response of tissues, with and without spherical inclusions, to an impulsive acoustic radiation force excitation from a linear array transducer. These FEM models were validated with calibrated phantoms. Shear wave speed, and therefore elasticity, dictates tissue relaxation following ARFI excitation, but Poisson's ratio and density do not significantly alter tissue relaxation rates. Increased acoustic attenuation in tissue increases the relative amount of tissue displacement in the near field compared with the focal depth, but relaxation rates are not altered. Applications of this model include improving image quality, and distilling material and structural information from tissue's dynamic response to ARFI excitation. Future work on these models includes incorporation of viscous material properties and modeling the ultrasonic tracking of displaced scatterers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite-element method model of soft tissue response to impulsive acoustic radiation force","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33153/01561624.pdf","startPage":"1699","endPage":"1712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2005","displayDocTitle":"A finite-element method model of soft tissue response to impulsive acoustic radiation force","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1561624/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8666023","pubMedId":"16382621","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite-element method model of soft tissue response to impulsive acoustic radiation force","sourcePdf":"1561624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110622S","chronDate":"Oct.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"33153","articleId":"1561624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561658,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By the ultrasonic measurement of the myocardial motion, we have already found that some pulsive waves are spontaneously excited by aortic-valve closure (AVC) at end-systole (To). These waves may serve as an ideal source of the intrinsic heart sound caused by AVC. In this study, using a sparse sector scan, in which the beam directions are restricted to about 16, the pulsive waves were measured almost simultaneously at about 160 points set along the heart wall at a sufficiently high frame rate. The consecutive spatial phase distributions, obtained by the Fourier transform of the measured waves, clearly revealed wave propagation along the heart wall for the first time. The propagation time of the wave along the heart wall is very small (namely, several milliseconds) and cannot be measured by conventional equipment. Based on this phenomenon, we developed a means to measure the myocardial viscoelasticity in vivo. In this measurement, the phase velocity of the wave is determined for each frequency component. By comparing the dispersion of the phase velocity with the theoretical one of the Lamb wave (the plate flexural wave), which propagates along the viscoelastic plate (heart wall) immersed in blood, the instantaneous viscoelasticity is determined noninvasively. This is the first report of such noninvasive determination. In in vivo experiments applied to five healthy subjects, propagation of the pulsive wave was clearly visible in all subjects. For the 60-Hz component, the typical propagation speed rapidly decreased from 5 m/s just before the time of AVC (t = To - 8 ms) to 3 m/s at t = To + 10 ms. In the experiments, it was possible to determine the viscosity more precisely than the elasticity. The typical value of elasticity was about 24-30 kPa arid did not change around the time of AVC. The typical transient values of viscosity decreased rapidly from 400 Pa/spl middot/s at t = To - 8 ms to 70 Pa-s at t = To + 10 ms. The measured shear elasticity and viscosity in this study are comparable to those obtained for the human tissues using audio frequency in in vitro experiments reported in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33154/01561662.pdf","startPage":"1931","endPage":"1942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of spontaneously actuated pulsive vibration in human heart wall and in vivo viscoelasticity estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Heart","In vivo","Viscosity","Elasticity","Automatic voltage control","Myocardium","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Phase measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","viscoelasticity","biomechanics","biomedical ultrasonics","Fourier transform spectra","surface acoustic waves","elastic waves","blood","elasticity","viscosity","biological tissues"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spontaneously actuated pulsive vibration","human heart wall","in vivo viscoelasticity estimation","myocardial viscoelasticity","heart diastolic properties","ultrasonic measurement","myocardial motion","aortic-valve closure","end-systole","intrinsic heart sound","sparse sector scan","pulsive waves","Fourier transform","Lamb wave","plate flexural wave","shear elasticity","viscosity","human tissues","60 Hz","24 to 30 kPa"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Echocardiography","Elasticity","Heart Ventricles","Heart Ventricles","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Male","Models, Cardiovascular","Pulsatile Flow","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Ventricular Function, Left","Vibration","Viscosity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Propagation of spontaneously actuated pulsive vibration in human heart wall and in vivo viscoelasticity estimation","volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1561662/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8685445","pubMedId":"16422405","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of spontaneously actuated pulsive vibration in human heart wall and in vivo viscoelasticity estimation","sourcePdf":"1561662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091158S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"33154","articleId":"1561662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1561665,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Microbubbles are generated at the focus of an ultrafast 793-nm laser source and simultaneously monitored through ultrasonic pulse-echo recordings. Displayed in wavefield form, these recordings illustrate microbubble creation, and integrated backscatter plots provide specifics about microbubble characteristics arid dissolution behavior. By varying laser parameters, including pulse fluence (or pulse energy flux, J/cm/sup 2/), total number of pulses delivered, and the period between pulses, the size, lifetime, and dissolution dynamics of laser-induced microbubbles may be independently controlled. Pulse fluence is the main size-controlling parameter, whereas both increases in pulse fluence and pulse number can lengthen microbubble lifetime from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. In short, a microbubble of particular lifetime does not necessarily have to be of a particular size. Microbubble behavior, furthermore, is independent of pulse periods below a fluence-dependent threshold value, but it exhibits stochastic behavior if pulse repetition is too slow. These results demonstrate that laser pulse fluence, number, and period may be varied to deposit energy in a specific temporal manner, creating arid stabilizing microbubbles with particular characteristics and, therefore, potential uses in sensitive acoustic detection and manipulation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic detection of controlled laser-induced microbubble creation in gelatin","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33154/01561665.pdf","startPage":"1962","endPage":"1969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33154","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic detection of controlled laser-induced microbubble creation in gelatin","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1561665/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8697949","pubMedId":"16422408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic detection of controlled laser-induced microbubble creation in gelatin","sourcePdf":"1561665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067665S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33154","articleId":"1561665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561668,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Borden","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/33154/1561668/1561668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark Andrew Borden (M'04) received the B.S. degree in chemical engineering in 1999 from the University of Arizona, Tucson, and the Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering in 2003 from the University of California, Davis.

Shell cohesiveness was changed by varying phospholipid and emulsifier composition, and shell microstructure was controlled by postproduction processing. Individual microbubbles with initial resting diameters between 1 and 10 /spl mu/m were isolated and recorded during pulsing with brightfield and fluorescence video microscopy. Microbubble destruction occurred through two modes: acoustic dissolution at 400 and 600 kPa and fragmentation at 800 kPa peak negative pressure. Lipid composition significantly impacted the acoustic dissolution rate, fragmentation propensity, and mechanism of excess lipid shedding. Less cohesive shells resulted in micron-scale or smaller particles of excess lipid material that shed either spontaneously or on the next pulse. Conversely, more cohesive shells resulted in the buildup of shell-associated lipid strands and globular aggregates of several microns in size; the latter showed a significant increase in total shell surface area and lability. Lipid-coated microbubbles were observed to reach a stable size over many pulses at intermediate acoustic pressures. Observations of shell microstructure between pulses allowed interpretation of the state of the shell during oscillation. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for therapeutic and diagnostic applications involving lipid-coated microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents and drug/gene delivery vehicles.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561668","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33154/01561668.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"1992","endPage":"2002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of lipid shell physicochemical properties on ultrasound-induced microbubble destruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Influence of lipid shell physicochemical properties on ultrasound-induced microbubble destruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561668/","volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1561668/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8697952","pubMedId":"16422411","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of lipid shell physicochemical properties on ultrasound-induced microbubble destruction","sourcePdf":"1561668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087318S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"33154","articleId":"1561668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1561681,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The different sources of noise include thermal or resistor noise added by the measuring circuit, and high-frequency sinusoidal signals that electromagnetically couple from radio broadcasts and/or carrier wave communications. Sophisticated methods are required to detect PD signals correctly. Fortunately, advances in analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) technology, and recent developments in digital signal processing (DSP) enable easy extraction of PD signals. This paper deals with the denoising of PD signals caused by corona discharges. Several techniques are investigated and employed on simulated as well as real PD data.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2005.1561798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/33159/01561798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2005.1561798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33159","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal denoising techniques for partial discharge measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal denoising techniques for partial discharge measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8691776","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1561798/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal denoising techniques for partial discharge measurements","sourcePdf":"01561798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059116S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"33159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"33159","articleId":"1561798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":1561823,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/33160/1561823/1561823-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Ho Kim (S '00) received B.

The proposed architecture gives due consideration to the peculiar aspects of CMOS image sensors and the human visual perception related to the particular application of digital color photography. A main difference between the proposed method arid the conventional systems is the fact that color correction module is located before the interpolation module. Therefore, a method of performing color correction on a color filter array (CFA) pattern is also provided in this paper. The interpolation algorithm is especially designed to solve the problem of pixel cross talk among the pixels of different color channels. The algorithm separates the green channel into two planes, one highly correlated with the red channel and the other with the blue channel. These separate planes are used for red and blue channel interpolation. The implementation details related to managing four color channel values is also described. Experiments conducted on McBeth color chart and natural images have shown that the proposed color processing chain produces better quality images with improved SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/33160/01561829.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2005.1561829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2005.1561829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel color processing architecture for digital cameras with CMOS image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Digital cameras","CMOS image sensors","Interpolation","CMOS process","Image sensors","Humans","Visual perception","Photography","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","digital photography","CMOS image sensors","cameras","interpolation","optical filters","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color processing architecture","digital cameras","CMOS image sensors","digital color cameras","complementary metal oxide semiconductor","color correction module","interpolation module","color filter array","color channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Novel color processing architecture for digital cameras with CMOS image sensors","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1561829/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8755269","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel color processing architecture for digital cameras with CMOS image sensors","sourcePdf":"01561829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057547S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"33160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33160","articleId":"1561829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561830,"authors":[{"name":"Haining Jiang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/33160/1561830/1561830-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haining Jiang received her B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Harbin Engineering University in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been the backbone technique in the current DVB-T systems adopted by Europe and Japan. However, since the OFDM system is very sensitive to the frequency synchronization and phase errors, which induces the intercarrier interference (ICI), the ongoing research has been dedicated to this ICI problem in the presence of the Doppler frequency drift and the fading channels. A means to deal with the ICI problem is called the ICI self-cancellation or polynomial cancellation coding scheme. In this paper, we establish the complete simulation environment for the physical layer of the DVB-T system and then evaluate the effectiveness of the ICI self-cancellation coding scheme compared with the existing convolutional coding scheme for different fading channels and different Doppler frequencies. According to our simulation results, we conclude that the ICI self-cancellation scheme significantly outperforms the convolutional coding scheme which is adopted by the existing DVB-T standard for the AWGN and the frequency non-selective fading channels, but both schemes have the similar performance in the frequency-selective fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/33160/01561832.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2005.1561832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2005.1561832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of an ICI self-cancellation coded transceiver for mobile DVB-T applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Digital video broadcasting","OFDM","Fading","Convolutional codes","Multimedia communication","Broadcast technology","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Spine","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","transceivers","mobile radio","digital video broadcasting","multimedia communication","Doppler shift","fading channels","channel coding","convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICI self-cancellation coded transceiver","mobile DVB-T applications","digital video broadcasting-terrestrial","multimedia technology","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","Doppler frequency drift","fading channels","polynomial cancellation coding scheme","convolutional coding scheme","AWGN","frequency nonselective fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of an ICI self-cancellation coded transceiver for mobile DVB-T applications","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1561832/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8755271","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of an ICI self-cancellation coded transceiver for mobile DVB-T applications","sourcePdf":"01561832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07472S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"33160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33160","articleId":"1561832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561833,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The system used was the European digital video broadcast-terrestrial (DVB-T) but due to technological constraints at the time, the system chosen was the 2K system - a system that uses 1705 carriers to convey the digital television services through a hostile terrestrial environment. Today, these constraints are no longer applicable but in order to maintain backwards compatibility to the older set top boxes, the 2K system is still used. The 2K system has the disadvantage of excluding the possibility of employing a single frequency network (SFN) - something that can help minimize the required bandwidth for television services. This paper demonstrates an observed phenomenon that explains why DVB-T fails to meet the required BER criteria and also shows how this phenomenon can be used in a computationally inexpensive technique for estimating the relative path attenuation of a multipath signal and how it can be used to estimate the parameters required for a soft decision QAM demapper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","volume":"51","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8739499","htmlLink":"/document/1561833/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A soft decision 16-QAM demodulation algorithm for multipath affected DVB-T systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A soft decision 16-QAM demodulation algorithm for multipath affected DVB-T systems","sourcePdf":"01561833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053346S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"33160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33160","articleId":"1561833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561835,"authors":[{"name":"Heejung Yu","affiliation":["Next Generation WLAN Research Team, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/33160/1561835/1561835-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heejung Yu received the B.S. degree in radio science and engineering from the Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2001.

The architecture is able to perform a full motion search on integral multiples of 4/spl times/4 blocks sizes. To use the architecture, each 16/spl times/16 macroblock of the source frames should be partitioned into sixteen 4/spl times/4 non-overlapping subblocks, called primitive subblocks. The architecture contains sixteen modules and one VBSME processor. Each module, realized by cascading ID systolic arrays, is responsible for the block-matching operations of a different primitive subblock. The realization has the advantages of high throughput, high flexibility and 100 % processing element (PE) utilization. The motion estimation of all the primitive subblocks is performed in parallel. Because these primitive subblocks can be used to form the 41 subblocks of different sizes specified by the H.264, the VBSME processor is employed to concurrently compute the sums of absolute differences (SADs) of all the 41 subblocks from the SADs of the primitive subblocks. This new architecture has lower latency and higher throughput over other exiting VBSME architectures for the hardware implementation of H.264 encoders.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for H.264 variable block size motion estimation","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2005.1561858","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2005.1561858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/33160/01561858.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","displayDocTitle":"An efficient VLSI architecture for H.264 variable block size motion estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"51","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1561858/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8739518","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient VLSI architecture for H.264 variable block size motion estimation","sourcePdf":"01561858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059086S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"33160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"33160","articleId":"1561858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1561859,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chia Sun","affiliation":["The Laboratory for Low-Power system, Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chi-Chia Sun received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering from National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan (2001\u20132004).

This paper proposes a novel extension of histogram equalization, actually histogram specification, to overcome such drawback as HE. To maximize the entropy is the essential idea of HE to make the histogram as flat as possible. Following that, the essence of the proposed algorithm, named brightness preserving histogram equalization with maximum entropy (BPHEME), tries to find, by the variational approach, the target histogram that maximizes the entropy, under the constraints that the mean brightness is fixed, then transforms the original histogram to that target one using histogram specification. Comparing to the existing methods including HE, brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization (BBHE), equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization (DSIHE), and minimum mean brightness error bi-histogram equalization (MMBEBHE), experimental results show that BPHEME can not only enhance the image effectively, but also preserve the original brightness quite well, so that it is possible to be utilized in consumer electronic products.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2005.1561863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/33160/01561863.pdf","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2005.1561863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brightness preserving histogram equalization with maximum entropy: a variational perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561863/","displayDocTitle":"Brightness preserving histogram equalization with maximum entropy: a variational perspective","volume":"51","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8739523","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561863/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brightness preserving histogram equalization with maximum entropy: a variational perspective","sourcePdf":"01561863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046808S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"33160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"33160","articleId":"1561863","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561867,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/33160/1561867/1561867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Yu was born in Wuhan, China, in 1983.

A link built in the unexplored band W connects the Earth station to a LEO satellite (called DAVID). The communication among DAVID and other sites is performed by means of an inter-satellite link in Ka band, which connects the LEO satellite to a GEO one (called ARTEMIS) and the latter to the Earth stations. The main peculiarities of the investigated scenario consist of the visibility of a LEO satellite, limited to a few minutes, and of the only partial availability over time of a return link on the GEO path. LEO visibility may seriously affect the data communication because it implies suspend/resume mechanisms to match nonvisibility periods. The partial unavailability of the return link makes (transmission control protocol) TCP-based solutions barely applicable and implies the design of effective protocol architectures, in order to guarantee a reliable data communication. Several investigations about alternative novel architectures have been produced in order to individuate solutions that meet all the network requirements in terms of service reliability, exploitation of the network resources, and overall service time. The analysis is two-fold: on one hand the attention has been addressed to the LEO path, highlighting the features offered by a transport layer splitting approach and by an application-based solution exploiting the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) protocol stack, whose performance is compared with the results provided by the TCP/IP protocol stack, commonly used in the Internet (where IP stands for Internet Protocol). Concerning CEO path, assuming the return link only partially available, two alternatives of the CCSDS protocol stack have been investigated: the first one implies the use of a negative acknowledgement scheme, the second one does not require any availability of a return link. The two paths together compose the end-to-end communication, which is also globally analyzed on the basis of the performance offered by the solutions presented for the two portions. All the results have been obtained by using a simulator developed for the aim.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8710630","htmlLink":"/document/1561883/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of data transfer protocols over space communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of data transfer protocols over space communications","sourcePdf":"01561883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117809S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"33161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"33161","articleId":"1561883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1561884,"authors":[{"name":"B.-N.

Although the foundation has been established in the form of finite set statistics (FISST), its relationship to conventional probability is not clear. Furthermore, optimal Bayesian multitarget filtering is not yet practical due to the inherent computational hurdle. Even the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates only the first moment (or PHD) instead of the full multitarget posterior, still involves multiple integrals with no closed forms in general. This article establishes the relationship between FISST and conventional probability that leads to the development of a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) multitarget filter. In addition, an SMC implementation of the PHD filter is proposed and demonstrated on a number of simulated scenarios. Both of the proposed filters are suitable for problems involving nonlinear nonGaussian dynamics. Convergence results for these filters are also established.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2005.1561884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/33161/01561884.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2005.1561884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo methods for multitarget filtering with random finite sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo methods for multitarget filtering with random finite sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561884/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8710631","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561884/","volume":"41","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Monte Carlo methods for multitarget filtering with random finite sets","sourcePdf":"01561884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128915S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"33161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"726","xplore-issue":"33161","articleId":"1561884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":1561886,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Solid state mass memories (SSMMs) are particularly suitable for space applications and more in general for harsh environments such us, for example, nuclear accelerators or avionics. The presented FTSSMM design has been entirely based on commercial off the shelf (COTS) components. In fact, cost competitive and very high performance SSMMs cannot be easily implemented by using space qualified components, due the technological gap and very high cost characterizing these components. In order to match the severe reliability requirements of space applications a COTS-based apparatus must be designed by using suitable system level methodologies (Kluth, 1996 and Fichna, 1998). In the proposed architecture, error-correcting codes are used to strengthen the commercial dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, while the system controller has been designed by applying suitable fault tolerant design techniques. Different from other proposed solutions, our architecture fully exploits the reconfiguration capabilities of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, discriminates between permanent and transient faults reducing the use of spare elements, and provides dynamic reconfiguration and graceful degradation capability, i.e., the FTSSMM performances are gracefully reduced in case of permanent faults, maintaining part of the system functionality. The paper shows the FTSSMM design methodology, the architecture, the reliability analysis, some simulation results, and a description of its implementation based on fast prototyping techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","volume":"41","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8710636","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1561889/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant solid state mass memory for space applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant solid state mass memory for space applications","sourcePdf":"01561889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102695S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"33161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33161","articleId":"1561889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1561921,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These proposals involve different layers of the protocol stack, and address both cellular and ad hoc networks. There has also been work relating to the implementation of cross-layer interactions. It is high time that these various individual efforts be put into perspective and a more holistic view be taken. In this article, we take a step in that direction by presenting a survey of the literature in the area of cross-layer design, and by taking stock of the ongoing work. We suggest a definition for cross-layer design, discuss the basic types of cross-layer design with examples drawn from the literature, and categorize the initial proposals on how cross-layer interactions may be implemented. We then highlight some open challenges and new opportunities for cross-layer design. Designers presenting cross-layer design proposals can start addressing these as they move ahead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer design: a survey and the road ahead","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2005.1561928","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/33162/01561928.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2005.1561928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer design: a survey and the road ahead","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1561928/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer design: a survey and the road ahead","sourcePdf":"01561928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042324S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"33162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"594","xplore-issue":"33162","articleId":"1561928","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1561930,"authors":[{"name":"Guocong Song","affiliation":["Motorola, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["Guocong Song (guocongsong@motorola.com) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees form Tsinghua University, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2005, all in electrical engineering.

Most future networks will be hybrid in nature - having terrestrial nodes interconnected by satellite links. Security is an important concern in such networks, since the satellite segment is susceptible to a host of attacks, including eavesdropping, session hijacking and data corruption. In this article we address the issue of securing communication in satellite networks. We discuss various security attacks that are possible in hybrid satellite networks, and survey the different solutions proposed to secure data communications in these networks. We look at the performance problems arising in hybrid networks due to security additions like Internet security protocol (IPSec) or secure socket layer (SSL), and suggest solutions to performance-related problems. We also point out important drawbacks in the proposed solutions, and suggest a hierarchical key-management approach for adding data security to group communication in hybrid networks.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2005.1561945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/33163/01561945.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2005.1561945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security issues in hybrid networks with a satellite component","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1561945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1561945/","displayDocTitle":"Security issues in hybrid networks with a satellite component","volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8712604","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1561945/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security issues in hybrid networks with a satellite component","sourcePdf":"01561945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048006S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"33163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"33163","articleId":"1561945","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1561946,"authors":[{"name":"G.

At the device level, we resolve effects of channel temperatures and thermal boundary conditions on device performance. Thus we obtain non-isothermal device characteristics for a representative device of the technology node used to fabricate the 3D-IC. At the 3D-IC level, we first approximate the average heat generation of each device on the chip using a statistical Monte Carlo method. We second determine effects of the chip layout and the fabrication materials on thermal coupling. Next we calculate thermal profile of the 3D-IC in conjunction with the individual device operations, 3D-IC layout and full-chip workload statistics. Our technique offers a numerical method to isolate affects of chip layout, floor-plan and operational activity on 3D-IC thermal profile. Thus it enables designers to pinpoint potential hotspots, and test new design paradigms for cooling methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"01-03 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562038/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1562038/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Simulation of Device Performance and Heating of Vertically Stacked Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled Simulation of Device Performance and Heating of Vertically Stacked Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"01562038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032879S","chronDate":"01-03 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10443","isNumber":"33165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10443","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33165","articleId":"1562038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1562042,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Seong Doh","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji-Seong Doh","id":"37087262654"},{"name":"Dae-Wook Kim","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae-Wook Kim","id":"37087262804"},{"name":"Sang-Hoon Lee","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Hoon Lee","id":"37087170030"},{"name":"Jong-Bae Lee","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Bae Lee","id":"37087538785"},{"name":"Young-kwan Park","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-kwan Park","id":"37087169401"},{"name":"Moon-Hyun Yoo","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moon-Hyun Yoo","id":"37087299425"},{"name":"Jeong-Taek Kong","affiliation":["CAE Team, Memory Division, Semiconductor Business Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeong-Taek Kong","id":"37087263410"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"4-9902762-0-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1569"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1577"}],"articleNumber":"1562042","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":681},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Semiconductor device modeling","Predictive models","Circuit simulation","Circuit testing","CMOS technology","Threshold voltage","SPICE","Circuit optimization","Delay"]}],"abstract":"An efficient characterization technique with the spatial correlation matrix from electrical device parameters such as threshold voltage and saturation current accounting for inter- and intra-die variations is demonstrated. Then, a unified statistical model based on the correlation matrix is developed and implemented to the SPICE simulator to predict the distribution of circuit performance. In order to verify our model, test chips which consist of transistors and ring oscillators were fabricated using a 130nm CMOS technology. Simulated delay/skew variations of ring oscillators agree well with the measurement of test chips, maintaining a reasonable accuracy of 85 %. Especially, we show that as the distance of the two ring oscillators becomes larger, the timing skew between them becomes bigger. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis for the performance of simple analog and digital circuit, is performed in terms of inter-and intra-die variation.","doi":"10.1109/SISPAD.2005.201490","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference On Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/10443/33165/01562042.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISPAD.2005.201490","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference On Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Statistical Model for Inter-Die and Intra-Die Process Variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1562042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"01-03 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Statistical Model for Inter-Die and Intra-Die Process Variation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562042/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1562042/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Statistical Model for Inter-Die and Intra-Die Process Variation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"01562042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067305S","chronDate":"01-03 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10443","isNumber":"33165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10443","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33165","articleId":"1562042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Japan Society of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":1562076,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The IQRD-based recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm (IQRD-RLS) is very popular because, it has good numerical stability and can be mapped onto coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) processor-based systolic arrays, which is suitable for very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI) architecture and real time applications. Robustness will be added to our receiver by implementing a new fast and simple subspace tracking algorithm for tracking channel vector based also on IQRD algorithm. In IQRD updating method the weights can be calculated without back substitution which gives numerical stability to such algorithms. In this paper we develop a novel multiuser detection (MUD) receiver based on the minimum output energy (MOE) detector and linearly constraint IQRD-RLS algorithm with optimized constraints via subspace tracking algorithm for tracking channel vector.

In the past, test configurations are usually derived manually and there still lacks of an efficient fault simulator to evaluate the resulted fault coverage. Based on the BIST-based structure, an efficient fault simulator (FPGAsim) for FPGAs is proposed to alleviate it. The fault models can be updated by using a script file as well as the FPGA dimensions. Therefore, the flexibility of FPGAsim is very high. According to the regular structure during the BIST sessions, the simulation complexity can be reduced from O(N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2 </sup>\n) to O(1). That is, the simulation complexity is independent of the size of an FPGA. The fault simulator proposed above is also helpful for solving the following problems. 1) Given a set of target fault models, generate the required test configurations with 100% fault coverage. 2) Given a set of target fault models and a test length constraint, generate the test configurations with the highest fault coverage. 3) Set the priority of test configurations such that test length/test time can be reduced. In other words, FPGAsim can be used for generation of optimal test configurations","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33167/01562423.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"867 Vol. 2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562423","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient fault simulation techniques and test configuration generation for embedded FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient fault simulation techniques and test configuration generation for embedded FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562423/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1562423/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8824022","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-30 Dec. 2003","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient fault simulation techniques and test configuration generation for embedded FPGAs","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047867S","chronDate":"30-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","xplore-issue":"33167","articleId":"1562423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1562424,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Tahir","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Tahir","id":"37563009400"},{"name":"A.

This paper presents a new approach for discriminating transient phenomena of power transformer, which may be implemented in digital relaying for transformer differential protection. Discrimination between internal faults, external faults and magnetizing inrush currents is achieved by combining wavelet transforms and fuzzy logic. The wavelet transform is applied for the analysis of the power transformer transient phenomena because of its ability to extract information from the transient signals in both time and frequency domain. Fuzzy logic is used because of the uncertainty in the differential current signals and relay settings. MATLAB power system toolbox is used to generate current signals at both sides of a power transformer in a typical system with various conditions. The simulation results obtained show that the new algorithm provides a high operating sensitivity for internal faults and remains stable for external faults and inrush currents.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562490","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33168/01562490.pdf","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1121 Vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new algorithm for the classification of different transient phenomena in power transformers combining wavelet transforms and fuzzy logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1562490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562490/","displayDocTitle":"A new algorithm for the classification of different transient phenomena in power transformers combining wavelet transforms and fuzzy logic","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8690205","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1562490/","conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new algorithm for the classification of different transient phenomena in power transformers combining wavelet transforms and fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062443S","chronDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","xplore-issue":"33168","articleId":"1562490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1562503,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Che Chung","affiliation":["Signal and Media Laboratories, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ting-Che Chung","id":"37558826400"},{"name":"Chih-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Signal and Media Laboratories, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Wei Chen","id":"37559716200"},{"name":"O.T.C.

This receiver system includes three low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), I and Q mixers, and a multi-phase range-programmable voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Each LNA embedded with switches to have a gain approximately ranging from -90dB to 16dB is designed to minimize power dissipation and the intensity of unnecessary signals, and to increase in isolation. The multi-phase range-programmable VCO consists of a phase-setting unit and two range-programmable VCOs where the range-programmable VCO controls the number of its paralleled inverter rings in use to generate multi-band signals. Compared to the conventional dual-band and multi-band receivers, the proposed receiver uses the multi-phase range-programmable VCO to minimize cost of area and power dissipation. The proposed multi-band front-end receiver is implemented by TSMC IP6M 0.18/spl mu/m CMOS technology with a die size of 2.4/spl times/2.4mm/sup 2/. At a supply voltage of 1.8V, the gains of the three frequency bands of Bluetooth, WCDMA, and GPS could reach at least 24dB and more, noise figures at below 5dB, and IF frequencies consistently at 2MHz. Therefore, our front-end receiver architecture can be utilized at various integrated multi-band receiver systems with low hardware cost, low power dissipation and fairly good receiving performances.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562503","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33168/01562503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33168","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1178 Vol. 3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-band RF front-end receiver for Bluetooth, WCDMA, and GPS applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1562503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multi-band RF front-end receiver for Bluetooth, WCDMA, and GPS applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562503/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8690218","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1562503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-band RF front-end receiver for Bluetooth, WCDMA, and GPS applications","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051495S","chronDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33168","articleId":"1562503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1562507,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mangoud","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Comm, College of Engineering, AAST, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Mangoud","id":"37270465400"},{"name":"M.A. Aboul-Dahab","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Comm, College of Engineering, AAST, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Aboul-Dahab","id":"38277412000"},{"name":"A.I.

Based on our simulation results, the proposed method can practically estimate the reliable channel SNR to refine the correction performance after several frames.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33168","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1205 Vol. 3","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33168/01562509.pdf","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low complexity algorithm and architecture design for channel estimation in turbo codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Channel estimation","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Degradation","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Channel coding","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","communication complexity","channel estimation","turbo codes","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity algorithm","channel estimation","turbo codes","iterative decoding","maximum a posteriori probability algorithm","channel signal-to-noise ratio","turbo decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity algorithm and architecture design for channel estimation in turbo codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562509/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1562509/","accessionNumber":"8690224","publicationDate":"2003","conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity algorithm and architecture design for channel estimation in turbo codes","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046604S","chronDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","xplore-issue":"33168","articleId":"1562509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1562512,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

In the estimation process, we propose 2 methods to treat the multi-user interference. In the first one, we propose to combine the interference cancellation scheme together with the channel estimation scheme to reduce or remove the interference on the pilot and, therefore, to have a better channel estimate. In the second one, we propose to estimate channel parameters from interferers if they are much stronger than the pilot. These techniques can be used in any CDMA-based system especially the third generation WCDMA systems. Computer simulation is used to compare between the proposed methods and the conventional common pilot-aided one. These techniques can be implemented in the mobile unit where there is no prior knowledge of interfering users' codes or data rates (blind estimation).","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33168/01562512.pdf","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1216 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1562512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new channel estimation technique for any CDMA-based communications system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiaccess communication","Parameter estimation","Multiple access interference","Interference cancellation","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Downlink","Decoding","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","multiuser channels","3G mobile communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channel estimation problem","CDMA communications systems","multiuser interference","interference cancellation scheme","channel estimation scheme","channel parameters","third generation WCDMA systems","mobile unit","users codes interference","data rates","blind estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","displayDocTitle":"A new channel estimation technique for any CDMA-based communications system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1562512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2003","accessionNumber":"8690227","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new channel estimation technique for any CDMA-based communications system","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056036S","chronDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","xplore-issue":"33168","articleId":"1562512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1562516,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

The analysis results show that there is little spatial locality beyond the DRAM native page sizes used in the simulations. This supports the DRAM simulation results. Due to varying nature of DRAM performance, simulation of DRAM system or analysis of the application is essential before the implementation.","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562592","publicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2003 46th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10444/33168/01562592.pdf","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1551 Vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.2003.1562592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1562592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of a DRAM system with merged pages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562592/","displayDocTitle":"The performance of a DRAM system with merged pages","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1562592/","publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","accessionNumber":"8690307","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of a DRAM system with merged pages","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01562592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088482S","chronDate":"27-30 Dec. 2003","xplore-pub-id":"10444","isNumber":"33168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10444","xplore-issue":"33168","articleId":"1562592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1562597,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is compared with the regular particle swarm optimizer (PSO) invented by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 based on four different benchmark functions. PSO is motivated by the social behavior of organisms, such as bird flocking and fish schooling. Each particle studies its own previous best solution to the optimization problem, and its group's previous best, and then adjusts its position (solution) accordingly. The optimal value will be found by repeating this process. In the NPSO proposed here, each particle adjusts its position according to its own previous worst solution and its group's previous worst to find the optimal value. The strategy here is to avoid a particle's previous worst solution and its group's previous worst based on similar formulae of the regular PSO. Under all test cases, simulation shows that the NPSO always finds better solutions than PSO.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENG.2005.9","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10446/33170/01562846.pdf","publicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENG.2005.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new particle swarm optimization technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Organisms","Birds","Marine animals","Educational institutions","Testing","Books","Equations","Systems engineering and theory","Social factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","organism social behavior","optimal value"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1562846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new particle swarm optimization technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1562846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8715304","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01562846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059328S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10446","isNumber":"33170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10446","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33170","articleId":"1562846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1562852,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Hoon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Hoon Lee","id":"38257276600"},{"name":"Ji Ae Seok","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ji Ae Seok","id":"38258899000"},{"name":"Eon Kyeong Joo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"lastName":"Eon Kyeong Joo","id":"38221787800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2359-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1562852","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Parity check codes","Turbo codes","Iterative decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative algorithms","Performance analysis","Sum product algorithm","Interleaved codes","Finishing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes","parity check codes","concatenated codes","iterative decoding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serially concatenated low density parity check code","turbo code","global iteration","signal to noise ratio","iterative decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"LDPC (low density parity check) code shows good performance at high SNR (signal to noise ratio), but turbo code shows better performance than LDPC code at low SNR.

In this paper, we propose an unsymmetrical dual cross search algorithm (UDCS), using a small cross-search pattern as the initial step for small motion vector estimation in according to center-biased characteristics of motion-vector distribution.

We show that many of the techniques used to tolerate growing memory latencies do so at the expense of increased bandwidth requirements. Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies. Given the importance of maximizing memory bandwidth, we calculate effective pin bandwidth, then estimate optimal effective pin bandwidth. We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal-traffic caches filter accesses to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We see that there is a gap that can exceed two orders of magnitude between the total memory traffic generated by caches and the minimal-traffic caches---implying that the potential exists to increase effective pin bandwidth substantially. We decompose this traffic gap into four factors, and show they contribute quite differently to traffic reduction for different benchmarks. We conclude that, in the short term, pin bandwidth limitations will make more complex on-chip caches cost-effective. For example, flexible caches may allow individual applications to choose from a range of caching policies. In the long term, we predict that off-chip accesses will be so expensive that all system memory will reside on one or more processor chips.","doi":"10.1109/ISCA.1996.10002","publicationTitle":"23rd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA'96)","displayPublicationTitle":"23rd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA'96)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10448/33172/01563037.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA.1996.10002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Bandwidth Limitations of Future Microprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563037/","displayDocTitle":"Memory Bandwidth Limitations of Future Microprocessors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"24-24 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Bandwidth Limitations of Future Microprocessors","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"1563037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064648S","chronDate":"22-24 May 1996","isNumber":"33172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10448","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1563037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563038,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These CPU-centric designs invest a lot of power and chip area to bridge the widening gap between CPU and main memory speeds. Yet, many large applications do not operate well on these systems and are limited by the memory subsystem performance.This paper argues for an integrated system approach that uses less-powerful CPUs that are tightly integrated with advanced memory technologies to build competitive systems with greatly reduced cost and complexity. Based on a design study using the next generation 0.25\u00b5m, 256Mbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process and on the analysis of existing machines, we show that processor memory integration can be used to build competitive, scalable and cost-effective MP systems.We present results from execution driven uni- and multi-processor simulations showing that the benefits of lower latency and higher bandwidth can compensate for the restrictions on the size and complexity of the integrated processor. In this system, small direct mapped instruction caches with long lines are very effective, as are column buffer data caches augmented with a victim cache.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"24-24 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Missing the Memory Wall: The Case for Processor/Memory Integration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Missing the Memory Wall: The Case for Processor/Memory Integration","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"1563038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102221S","chronDate":"22-24 May 1996","isNumber":"33172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10448","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1563038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1563043,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources.

However, the top concern is robustness of wireless communications. Wireless control loops must be maintained under persistent adverse channel conditions, such as noise, large-scale path loss and fading. Many electro-magnetic interference sources in industrial environments, e.g. electric motor and welding, make wireless communication more challenging. The conventional IEEE 802.11 WLANs, which are designed for providing high bandwidth instead of high robustness, are therefore inappropriate for IC-WLAN. On the other hand, if the low data rate feature of industrial control is fully exploited by the state-of-the-art direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology, much higher robustness can be achieved. We hereby propose using DSSS-CDMA to build IC-WLAN, and exploiting the low data rate feature of industrial control loops for enhanced robustness. We carried out fine-grained physical layer simulations and Monte Carlo comparisons. The results show that DSSS-CDMA IC-WLAN provides much higher robustness than IEEE 802.11 WLAN, so that reliable wireless industrial control loops are made feasible. The DSSS-CDMA IC-WLAN scheme also opens up a new problem space for interdisciplinary study, involving real-time scheduling and resource management, communication, networking and control. In this paper, we study the resource management problems on maximizing robustness and minimizing control utility loss. Analytical resource optimization solutions are given","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10450/33174/01563091.pdf","startPage":"12 pp.","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'05)","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2005.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2005.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building robust wireless LAN for industrial control with DSSS-CDMA cellphone network paradigm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Wireless LAN","Industrial control","Spread spectrum communication","Cellular phones","Wireless communication","Communication system control","Noise robustness","Resource management","Open loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","IEEE standards","industrial control","real-time systems","resource allocation","scheduling","spread spectrum communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless LAN","industrial control","DSSS-CDMA cellphone network paradigm","wireless communications","wireless control loops","IEEE 802.11","direct sequence spread spectrum","real-time scheduling","resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-8 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Building robust wireless LAN for industrial control with DSSS-CDMA cellphone network paradigm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1563091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9025597","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2006","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building robust wireless LAN for industrial control with DSSS-CDMA cellphone network paradigm","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01563091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113249S","chronDate":"8-8 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10450","isNumber":"33174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10450","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33174","articleId":"1563091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1563110,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The allocation of code/data to scratchpad memory is performed at compile time leading to predictable memory access latencies. Current scratchpad memory allocation techniques improve the average-case execution time of tasks. For hard real-time systems, on the other hand, worst case execution time (WCET) is a key metric. In this paper, we propose scratchpad allocation techniques for data memory that aim to minimize a task's WCET. We first develop an integer linear programming (ILP) based solution which constructs the optimal allocation assuming that all program paths are feasible. Next, we employ branch-and-bound search to more accurately construct the optimal allocation by exploiting infeasible path information. However, the branch-and-bound search is too time-consuming in practice. Therefore, we design fast heuristic searches that achieve near-optimal allocations for all our benchmarks","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2005.45","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10450/33174/01563110.pdf","startPage":"10 pp.","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2005.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WCET centric data allocation to scratchpad memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-8 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563110/","displayDocTitle":"WCET centric data allocation to scratchpad memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9025616","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1563110/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WCET centric data allocation to scratchpad memory","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01563110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072218S","chronDate":"8-8 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10450","isNumber":"33174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10450","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"33174","articleId":"1563110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563127,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To guarantee performance, critical applications typically over-reserve resources based on worst-case resource usage estimates, while others may reserve based on average-case or other estimates. When resources are fully subscribed, the performance of soft- and non-real-time applications depends upon the effective distribution of dynamic slack - reserved, but unused resources - from other tasks. Motivated by several representative examples, we derive four general principles for the effective management of slack. We have implemented these principles in four progressively better slack schedulers that demonstrate their effectiveness.

Particle systems offer a mechanism for controlling point samples and distributing them according to needs of the application. Furthermore, particle systems can serve as a surface representation in their own right, or to augment implicit functions, allowing for both efficient rendering and control of implicit function parameters. The state of the art in surface sampling particle systems, however, presents some shortcomings. First, most of these systems have many parameters that interact with some complexity, making it difficult for users to tune the system to meet specific requirements. Furthermore, these systems do not lend themselves to spatially adaptive sampling schemes, which are essential for efficient, accurate representations of complex surfaces. In this paper we present a new class of energy functions for distributing particles on implicit surfaces and a corresponding set of numerical techniques.

For an array of parallel-driven cells, the acoustic parameters are derived as a complex mechanical fluid impedance, depending on the membrane shape form. As a main advantage, the nonlinear behavior of the CMUT can be investigated much easier and faster compared to FEM simulations, e.g., for a design of the maximum applicable voltage depending on the input signal.

It is based on a combination of a free acoustic mode description of an isolated CMUT, and the coupling of these modes to the fluid in which waves should be excited or detected through an impedance matrix that will depend on frequency. The parameters of the model describing the isolated CMUT is independent of frequency and excitation of neighbor CMUTs, whereas the acoustic impedance matrix describing the coupling to the fluid will depend on both the excitation of neighbor CMUTs and frequency. Hence, this splitting of the calculations has a potential for saving computer time. The analysis gives transfer functions from excitations that vary harmonically with time and space along the array surface to CMUT parameters as current, mode excitations, or output acoustic pressure. Based on this, the response of essentially arbitrary excitations of the CMUTs may be obtained. The method is used to analyze an infinitely large array of circular CMUTs on a rectangular grid. The CMUTs are assumed to be operating in collapsed mode. Sharp resonances are shown to occur that could be significantly damped by adding series resistors to the CMUTs or increasing the water viscosity.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33178/01563261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33178","startPage":"2173","endPage":"2184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMUT array modeling through free acoustic CMUT modes and analysis of the fluid CMUT interface through Fourier transform methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CMUT array modeling through free acoustic CMUT modes and analysis of the fluid CMUT interface through Fourier transform methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8769914","pubMedId":"16463484","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1563261/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMUT array modeling through free acoustic CMUT modes and analysis of the fluid CMUT interface through Fourier transform methods","sourcePdf":"1563261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094143S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33178","articleId":"1563261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563262,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

Both three-dimensional (3-D) and 2-D models were developed using a commercially available finite-element modeling (FEM) software. Depending on the dimensionality of the model, the membranes were constructed using plane or shell elements. The electrostatic gap was modeled using many parallel plate transducers. An axisymmetric model for a single membrane was built; the electrical input impedance of the device then was calculated in vacuum to investigate series and parallel resonant frequencies, where the input impedance has a minimum and a maximum, respectively. A method for decomposing the membrane capacitance into parasitic and active parts was demonstrated, and it was shown that the parallel resonant frequency shifted down with increased biased voltage. Calculations then were performed for immersion transducers. Acoustic wave propagation was simulated in the immersion medium, using appropriate elements in a 3-D model. Absorbing boundaries were implemented to avoid the reflections at the end of the medium mesh. One row of an array element, modeled with appropriate boundary conditions, was used to calculate the output pressure. The results were compared with a simpler model: a single membrane in immersion, with symmetry boundary conditions on the sidewalls that cause the calculations to reflect the properties of an infinitely large array. A 2-D model then was developed to demonstrate the effect of membrane dimensions on the output pressure and bandwidth. Our calculations revealed that the small signal transmit pressure was inversely proportional to the square root of gap height. We also compared FEM results with analytical and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33178/01563262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33178","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-element analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-element analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8769915","pubMedId":"16463485","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1563262/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-element analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","sourcePdf":"1563262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073547S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"33178","articleId":"1563262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563266,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Medical and underwater imaging and the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) societies have expressed growing interest in cMUTs over the years. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer technology is expected to make a strong impact on imaging technologies, especially volumetric imaging, and to appear in commercial products in the near future. This paper focuses on fabrication technologies for cMUTs and reviews and compares variations in the production processes. We have developed two main approaches to the fabrication of cMUTs: the sacrificial release process and the recently introduced wafer-bonding method. This paper gives a thorough review of the sacrificial release processes, and it describes the new wafer-bonding method in detail. Process variations are compared qualitatively and quantitatively whenever possible. Through these comparisons, it was concluded that wafer-bonded cMUT technology was superior in terms of process control, yield, and uniformity. Because the number of steps and consequent process time were reduced (from six-mask process to four-mask process), turn-around time was improved significantly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers: fabrication technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33178/01563267.pdf","startPage":"2242","endPage":"2258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33178","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers: fabrication technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1563267/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8769920","pubMedId":"16463490","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers: fabrication technology","sourcePdf":"1563267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141438S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"33178","articleId":"1563267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563269,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The same scheme has been adopted for capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (cMUTs). DC bias deflects the cMUT membranes toward the substrate, so that their centers are free to move during both receive and transmit operations. In this paper, we present time-domain, finite element calculations for cMUTs using LS-DYNA, a commercially available finite element package. In addition to this DC bias mode, other new cMUT operations (collapse and collapse-snapback) have recently been demonstrated. Because cMUT membranes make contact with the substrate in these new operations, modeling of these cMUTs should include contact analysis. Our model was a cMUT transducer consisting of many hexagonal membranes; because it was symmetrical, we modeled only one-sixth of a hexagonal cell loaded with a fluid medium. The finite element results for both conventional and collapse modes were compared to measurements made by an optical interferometer; a good match was observed. Thus, the model is useful for designing cMUTs that operate in regimes where membranes make contact with the substrate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33178/01563269.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33178","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducers","Biomembranes","Voltage","Finite element methods","Electrostatics","Packaging","Time domain analysis","Optical interferometry","Electrodes","Ultrasonic variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","ultrasonic transducers","micromechanical devices","time-domain analysis","finite element analysis","light interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","dynamic analysis","electrostatic transducers","voltage collapse","time-domain calculations","finite element calculations","hexagonal membranes","fluid medium","optical interferometer","membranes","substrates","contact analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Computer-Aided Design","Electric Capacitance","Electronics, Medical","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Finite Element Analysis","Linear Models","Membranes, Artificial","Microelectrodes","Miniaturization","Transducers","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1563269/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8769921","pubMedId":"16463492","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic analysis of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","sourcePdf":"1563269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079707S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33178","articleId":"1563269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1563270,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The applied structures are circular plates held at four bridges, thus partially undamped. A simple analytical model for the fully clamped structure is used as a reference to optimize design parameters such as thickness relations and electrodes, and to provide approximate predictions for coupling coefficients related to previously determined thin film properties. The best coupling coefficient was achieved with a 270-/spl mu/m plate and amounted to k/sup 2/=5.3%. This value compares well with the calculated value based on measured small signal dielectric (/spl epsi/=1050) and piezoelectric (/spl epsi//sub 31,f/=15 Cm/sup -2/) properties of the PZT thin film at 100 kV/cm dc bias. The resonances show relatively large Q-factors, which can be partially explained by the small diameters as compared to the sound wavelength in air and in the test liquid (Fluorinert 77). A transmit-receive experiment with two quasiidentical pMUTs was performed showing significant signal transmission up to a distance of 20 cm in air and 2 cm in the test liquid.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers based on PZT thin films","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563270","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/33178/01563270.pdf","startPage":"2276","endPage":"2288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1563270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33178","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers based on PZT thin films","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1563270/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8741906","pubMedId":"16463493","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers based on PZT thin films","sourcePdf":"1563270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101977S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"33178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"33178","articleId":"1563270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1563277,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A MANET offers a cost-effective solution for communications in areas where infrastructure is unavailable, e.g. disaster recovery situations and military applications. It especially suits the needs of the so-called airborne Internet, where air-to-ground and air-to-air connectivity involving mobile units is required. Traditional MANETs operate in the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, where the available bandwidth is facing the challenge of rapidly increasing demands. Free space optics (FSO) provides an attractive complement to RF wireless MANETs because of its high bandwidth and interference-free operation. In this paper, we present our preliminary research efforts in investigating the possibility of enhancing the performance of MANETs by introducing an FSO module to the communication nodes. Computer models involving such a module were created in the environment of OPNET modeler, a network simulation software package. Various issues related to the performance of such networks were simulated and analyzed. The analysis is of great assistance in the design and implementation of such next-generation MANETs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An initial study of mobile ad hoc networks with free space optical capabilities","publicationTitle":"24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2005.1563308","displayPublicationTitle":"24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10454/33179/01563308.pdf","startPage":"1.D.3","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2005.1563308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An initial study of mobile ad hoc networks with free space optical capabilities","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1563308/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8802666","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An initial study of mobile ad hoc networks with free space optical capabilities","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01563308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076121S","chronDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10454","isNumber":"33179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10454","xplore-issue":"33179","articleId":"1563308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1563440,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A main obstacle is, however, that torques can only be produced perpendicular to the magnetic field. In addition, there is uncertainty in the Earth magnetic field models due to the complicated dynamic nature of the field. Also, the magnetic hardware and the spacecraft can interact, causing both to behave in undesirable ways. This actuation principle has been a topic of research since earliest satellites were launched. Earlier magnetic control has been applied for nutation damping for gravity gradient stabilized satellites, and for velocity decrease for satellites without appendages. The three axes of a micro-satellite can be stabilized by using an electromagnetic actuator which is rigidly mounted on the structure of the satellite. The actuator consists of three mutually-orthogonal air-cored coils on the skin of the satellite.

The objectives of these tests were: 1) to determine a multiple equipment factor (MEF) to create a simulated signal source with RF energy equivalent to multiple T-PEDs inside the cabin; 2) to verify the hypothesis that MEF can be determined analytically using an accurate path loss model and the spatial distribution of T-PEDs within the cabin; 3) to evaluate external RF signal leakage from in-cabin mobile networks to assess potential interference to terrestrial mobile phone networks; 4) to evaluate passenger effects on RF propagation within the aircraft cabin. The aircraft cabin was equipped with picocell equipment capable of supporting 100 simultaneous CDMA mobile phone calls. 100 commercial-grade CDMA handsets were distributed evenly throughout the cabin. All handsets were configured for one of two scenarios: 1) manual full-power operation (representing the worst case); or 2) power-controlled communication with the picocell, where the phone is dynamically commanded to transmit the minimum power necessary to maintain the digital link. In each of these configurations, received power was measured mid-aisle along the length of the cabin, as well as external to the aircraft to a range of 1 km. Major findings were: 1) At mid-aisle, typical MEF for 100 phones was 9 dB; 2) MEF was accurately predicted from a empirically-derived path loss model and the known distribution of devices within the cabin; 3) Compared to full-power operation, cumulative power from 100 phones was reduced by approximately 60 dB when in communication with an onboard picocell; 4) Under picocell control, cumulative signal power from 100 phones was not observable beyond approximately 200 meters from the aircraft; 5) A handset outside the aircraft was unable to acquire the picocell signal beyond approximately 500 meters; 6) Each passenger standing in the aisle produced 0.5 to 1.0 dB of additional path loss along the length of the cabin.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2005.1563488","publicationTitle":"24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10454/33180/01563488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2005.1563488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33180","startPage":"12 pp. Vol. 2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF propagation characteristics of in-cabin CDMA mobile phone networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1563488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF propagation characteristics of in-cabin CDMA mobile phone networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563488/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8802755","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1563488/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF propagation characteristics of in-cabin CDMA mobile phone networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01563488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046432S","chronDate":"30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10454","isNumber":"33180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10454","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33180","articleId":"1563488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1563543,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Congestion control for VANETs has not been studied thoroughly so far - but this feature is extremely necessary for VANET applications and network performance. Due to the high mobility and the resulting highly dynamic network topology, congestion control needs to be performed in a decentralized and self-organized way, locally in each VANET node. This paper presents a novel concept for utility-based congestion control and packet forwarding in VANETs. The control algorithm uses an application-specific utility function and encodes the quantitative utility information in each transmitted data packet in a transparent way for all users within a local environment. A decentralized algorithm then calculates the \"average utility value\" of each individual node based on the utility of its data packets and assigns a share of the available data rate proportional to the relative priority. For performance evaluation, the proposed decentralized utility-based packet forwarding and congestion control (UBPFCC) is implemented on top of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Network simulations including vehicular mobility models demonstrate that UBPFCC avoids the typical starvation of some nodes inside the network and shows a significant increase of efficiency in information dissemination and fairness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2005.1563614","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10456/33184/01563614.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2005.1563614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Congestion control in vehicular ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Congestion control in vehicular ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1563614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8873538","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Congestion control in vehicular ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Shaanxi, China","sourcePdf":"01563614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071071S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10456","isNumber":"33184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10456","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33184","articleId":"1563614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1563624,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.P.

By analyzing MMSE filter and the enhanced one, it can be seen that although these filters are better trade-off between noise reduction and fine detail preserving, a basic premise is required for all statistic filters that the sample mean and variance of a pixel is equal to its local mean and variance based on pixels within a neighborhood surrounding it. It is validated only if the filtering area is large enough to assure the sample calculation robust and doesn't contain edge features, linear features or point targets for stationary assumption. An improved filter based on adaptive windowing and structure detection is proposed in this paper. This filter outputs the mean intensity of filtering area in homogeneous region. Maximum homogeneous filtering area decided by adaptive windowing technique is required to keep sample calculation robust. Structure feature such as line, edge and point target may appear in heterogeneous region and this invalidates the basic premise of stationary for all local statistic filters. Point target is preserved owing to special distribution and maximum window subset of linear and edge feature is decided by using different ratio detectors. Filtering process is accomplished calculating local statistics in window subset determined. Experiments on simulated image and real SAR one demonstrate that the improved MMSE filter proposed for speckle noise is superior both in noise reduction and in fine detail preserving.","doi":"10.1109/ICVES.2005.1563651","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety, 2005.","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVES.2005.1563651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33184","pdfPath":"/iel5/10456/33184/01563651.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety, 2005.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Noise reduction","Robustness","Statistical distributions","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Object detection","Analysis of variance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","adaptive signal processing","least mean squares methods","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speckle MMSE filter","adaptive windowing","structure detection","image segmentation","image classification","homogeneous filtering","adaptive windowing technique","filtering process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Research and improving on speckle MMSE filter based on adaptive windowing and structure detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563651/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1563651/","accessionNumber":"8873551","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research and improving on speckle MMSE filter based on adaptive windowing and structure detection","confLoc":"Shaanxi, China","sourcePdf":"01563651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046903S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10456","isNumber":"33184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10456","xplore-issue":"33184","articleId":"1563651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1563673,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":[" School of Electronic and information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Fei Wang","id":"37557032300"},{"name":"Huabiao Qin","affiliation":[" School of Electronic and information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Huabiao Qin","id":"37556197100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9435-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1563673","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":406},"abstract":"A large number of traffic accidents are caused by the driver fatigue or drowsiness. These misfortunes can be avoided by keeping a close watch on tired characters of the driver and making a warning signal immediately. This function is implemented by a FPGA based vehicle driver surveillance system presented in this paper. Several well-known image processing algorithms like gray scale projection, edge detection with Prewitt operator and complexity function are combined together to judge whether the driver has his eyes closed. Their hardware architectures have been modeled using the Altera DSPBuilder and integrated as a co-processor to the main Nios II processor which controls the whole system. All of the algorithm hardware implementations have been achieved in a parallel and pipelined way and discussed in detail.

The procedure takes advantage of the robustness of the rational interpolation method in extracting stable poles over partitioned bandwidth and the numerical stability and fast convergence of the vector fitting method in generating accurate high-order rational approximation. First, the stable poles of the entire frequency range are obtained by partitioning the domain and performing rational interpolation in each bandwidth. Then, the collected poles are used as initial poles to the vector-fitting algorithm to obtain the overall high-order rational approximation. The accuracy and convergence of the standard vector fitting and proposed methods are compared.

Consequently, accurate and exhaustive characterization is essential to improve the robustness and yield of current systems. However, the statistics of the system performance obtained from limited measurement can be unrepresentative of the final product. This paper describes the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) to generate the performance distribution and statistics of chip-to-chip communication system from measurements. A set of experiments is performed on a hardware system to capture the relationships between system parameters and performance. The measured data is then used to train the neural network that is used to efficiently generate realistic distributions and statistics of the system performance. The accuracy of the proposed approach is verified using a prototype system. The sensitivity of setup and hold times of the system is studied as functions of supply voltages and temperature. The results of the proposed method are also compared to those from measurements and regression

It is shown that due to the high efficiency of sixth order approximation, the proposed macromodel requires only a few elements to achieve good accuracy.

It preserves the advantages of the finite element method in circuit application such as the flexibility in modeling irregular geometry, the capability in handling arbitrary inhomogeneity, and the handling of sparse matrices. Meanwhile, it eliminates the disadvantages long associated with traditional finite element methods such as large memory requirement and high CPU cost resulted from 3D volumetric discretization.

A failure of one of these devices interrupts data transmission on the affected link completely and causes significant loss of income to the carrier. Therefore, detection of the EDFA's performance degradation is mandatory, since amplifiers can be replaced before they fail. State of the art techniques can only detect aging of the pump laser. In this paper, a novel algorithm is presented that allows for the detection of various degradation mechanisms. The algorithm allows to supervise the complete optical path within the EDFA and is based on appropriate modeling of the gain characteristics of the erbium-doped fiber. Thus, aging effects can be detected for arbitrary channel loads and power distributions at the input of the amplifier stage. Since the effect of pump excited state absorption (ESA) is included in the model, the algorithm is also applicable to amplifier stages using high power pumps.","doi":"10.1109/DRCN.2005.1563855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRCN.2005.1563855","startPage":"8 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"DRCN 2005).

In this study, we first propose an integrated data preparation scheme as a systematic study for neural network data analysis. In the integrated scheme, a survey of data preparation, focusing on problems with the data and corresponding processing techniques, is then provided. Meantime, some intelligent data preparation solution to some important issues and dilemmas with the integrated scheme are discussed in detail. Subsequently, a cost-benefit analysis framework for this integrated scheme is presented to analyze the effect of data preparation on complex data analysis. Finally, a typical example of complex data analysis from the financial domain is provided in order to show the application of data preparation techniques and to demonstrate the impact of data preparation on complex data analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2006.22","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/33191/01563984.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2006.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated data preparation scheme for neural network data analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"An integrated data preparation scheme for neural network data analysis","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8771114","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1563984/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated data preparation scheme for neural network data analysis","sourcePdf":"01563984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129309S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"33191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"33191","articleId":"1563984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1563988,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unlike most commercial filtering products, which are mainly based on textual content-based analysis such as indicative keywords detection or manually collected black list checking, WebGuard relies on several major data mining techniques associated with textual, structural content-based analysis, and skin color related visual content-based analysis as well. Experiments conducted on a testbed of 400 Web sites including 200 adult sites and 200 nonpornographic ones showed WebGuard's filtering effectiveness, reaching a 97.4 percent classification accuracy rate when textual and structural content-based analysis was combined with visual content-based analysis. Further experiments on a black list of 12,311 adult Web sites manually collected and classified by the French Ministry of Education showed that WebGuard scored a 95.62 percent classification accuracy rate. The basic framework of WebGuard can apply to other categorization problems of Web sites which combine, as most of them do today, textual and visual content.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2006.34","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/33191/01563988.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2006.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WebGuard: a Web filtering engine combining textual, structural, and visual content-based analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"WebGuard: a Web filtering engine combining textual, structural, and visual content-based analysis","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8771117","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1563988/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WebGuard: a Web filtering engine combining textual, structural, and visual content-based analysis","sourcePdf":"01563988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079124S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"33191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"33191","articleId":"1563988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1563998,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

An important and emerging category of such electronic systems are battery-powered mobile appliances, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, which are severely constrained in the resources they possess, namely, processor, battery, and memory. This work focuses on one important constraint of such devices-battery life-and examines how it is impacted by the use of various security mechanisms. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of a wide range of cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of security mechanisms such as security protocols. We then study the energy consumption requirements of the most popular transport-layer security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We investigate the impact of various parameters at the protocol level (such as cipher suites, authentication mechanisms, and transaction sizes, etc.) and the cryptographic algorithm level (cipher modes, strength) on the overall energy consumption for secure data transactions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of SSL. For our studies, we have developed a measurement-based experimental testbed that consists of an iPAQ PDA connected to a wireless local area network (LAN) and running Linux, a PC-based data acquisition system for real-time current measurement, the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL protocol, and parameterizable SSL client and server test programs. Based on our results, we also discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of security protocols. We believe such investigations to be an important first step toward addressing the challenges of energy-efficient security for battery-constrained systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.16","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/33192/01563998.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the energy consumption characteristics of cryptographic algorithms and security protocols","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1563998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A study of the energy consumption characteristics of cryptographic algorithms and security protocols","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8945587","htmlLink":"/document/1563998/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the energy consumption characteristics of cryptographic algorithms and security protocols","sourcePdf":"01563998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12465S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"33192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"33192","articleId":"1563998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564000,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The strategy consists in delaying communication until a mobile node moves close to its target peer node within an application- imposed deadline. We evaluate the performance of various heuristics that, based on the movement history of the mobile node, estimate an optimal time (in the sense of least energy use) of communication subject to the delay constraint. We evaluate the impact of the node movement model, length of movement history maintained, allowable delay, single hop versus multiple hop communication, and size of data transfer on the energy consumption. We also present measurement results on an iPAQ pocket PC that quantity energy consumption in executing the prediction algorithms. Our results show that, with relatively simple and, hence, efficient prediction heuristics, energy savings in communication can significantly outweigh the energy expenses in executing the prediction algorithms. Moreover, it is possible to achieve robust system performance across diverse node movement models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","volume":"5","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8945589","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564000/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the effectiveness of movement prediction to reduce energy consumption in wireless communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effectiveness of movement prediction to reduce energy consumption in wireless communication","sourcePdf":"01564000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095919S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"33192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"33192","articleId":"1564000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1564001,"authors":[{"name":"Dongmei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/33192/1564001/1564001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongmei Zhao received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in June 2002.

The mobile stations (MSs) are dual-mode, having both ad hoc and cellular CDMA radios. An active MS is free to choose any available relay station (RS) within its ad hoc radio coverage area for dual-hop communication with the CDMA base station (BS). Communications between the RSs and the MSs use bandwidth which is available to the ad hoc radio and does not consume the CDMA capacity. Using this mechanism, CDIVIA interference can be reduced by dynamically selecting RSs which have more favorable CDMA link characteristics. Several relay station selection criteria are considered, namely, ad hoc relaying with low relative interference (ARRI), with best link gain (ARLG), and with shortest distance (ARSD). The relay station selection protocols are compatible with existing wireless local area network (WLAN) standards such as IEEE 802.11. An analytic model is used to compute the effects on uplink and downlink CDMA capacities when out-of-band relaying is added. The results show that very significant capacity improvements are possible by using these criteria compared with conventional CDMA with hard or soft handoff. Ad hoc relaying which dynamically tracks CDMA link quality can achieve greater capacity improvements than that using a distance-based relay station selection. Relaying, which considers both signal and interference conditions, achieves better capacity than that based on signal link quality alone.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/33192/01564001.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular CDMA capacity with out-of-band multihop relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Relays","Protective relaying","Interference","Mobile communication","Wireless LAN","Base stations","Bandwidth","Wireless application protocol","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","telecommunication traffic","radio links","ad hoc networks","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular CDMA capacity","out-of-band multihop relaying","code division multiple access","ad hoc traffic","mobile stations","dual-hop communication","protocols","uplink CDMA","downlink CDMA","signal link quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Wireless communication networks","cellular CDMA","multihop relaying","capacity analysis."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Cellular CDMA capacity with out-of-band multihop relaying","volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1564001/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8945590","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular CDMA capacity with out-of-band multihop relaying","sourcePdf":"01564001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074259S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"33192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"33192","articleId":"1564001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564005,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Current processors that use DVS typically have an operating voltage range from full to half of the maximum V/sub dd/. However, there is no fundamental reason why designs cannot operate over a much larger voltage range: from full V/sub dd/ to subthreshold voltages. This possibility raises the question of whether a larger voltage range improves the energy efficiency of DVS. First, from a theoretical point of view, we show that, for subthreshold supply voltages, leakage energy becomes dominant, making \"just-in-time computation\" energy-inefficient at extremely low voltages. Hence, we introduce the existence of a so-called \"energy-optimal voltage\" which is the voltage at which the application is executed with the highest possible energy efficiency and below which voltage scaling reduces energy efficiency. We derive an analytical model for the energy-optimal voltage and study its trends with technology scaling and different application loads. Second, we compare several different low-power approaches including MTCMOS, standard DVS, and the proposed Insomniac (extended DVS into subthreshold operation). A study of real applications on commercial processors shows that Insomniac provides the best energy efficiency. From these results, we conclude that extending the voltage range below V/sub dd//2 will improve the energy efficiency for many processor designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","volume":"13","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564077/","accessionNumber":"8714407","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The limit of dynamic voltage scaling and insomniac dynamic voltage scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The limit of dynamic voltage scaling and insomniac dynamic voltage scaling","sourcePdf":"01564077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084531S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"33194","articleId":"1564077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1564079,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.M.

These failures lead to reduction in reliability of circuits, especially the area-constrained SRAM cells. In this paper, we have analyzed the emerging failure mechanisms in SRAM caches due to transistor V/sub t/ variations, which results from process variations. Also we have proposed solutions to detect those failures efficiently. In particular, in this work, SRAM failure mechanisms under transistor V/sub t/ variations are mapped to logic fault models. March test sequences have been optimized to address the emerging failure mechanisms with minimal overhead on test time. Moreover, we have proposed a design for test circuit to complement the March test sequence for at-speed testing of SRAMs. The proposed technique, referred as double sensing, can be used to test the stability of SRAM cells during read operations. Using the proposed March test sequence along with the double sensing technique, a test time reduction of 29% is achieved, compared to the existing test techniques with the same fault coverage. We have also demonstrated that double sensing can be used during SRAM normal operation for online detection and correction of any number of random read faults.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/33194/01564081.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient testing of SRAM with optimized march sequences and a novel DFT technique for emerging failures due to process variations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Efficient testing of SRAM with optimized march sequences and a novel DFT technique for emerging failures due to process variations","volume":"13","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8714411","htmlLink":"/document/1564081/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient testing of SRAM with optimized march sequences and a novel DFT technique for emerging failures due to process variations","sourcePdf":"01564081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0658S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33194","articleId":"1564081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564083,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Wook Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/33194/1564083/1564083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ju-Wook Jang (M'05) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea in 1983, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 1993.","From 1985 to 1988 and 1993 to 1994, he was with Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea, where he was involved in the development of a 1.5-Mb/s video codec and a parallel computer.

These have reduced energy dissipation and latency compared with the state-of-the-art field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based designs. By profiling well-known designs, we identify \"energy hot spots\", which are responsible for most of the energy dissipation. Based on this, we develop algorithms and architectures that offer tradeoffs among the number of I/O ports, the number of registers, and the number of PEs. To avoid time-consuming low-level simulations for energy profiling and performance prediction of many alternate designs, we derive functions to represent the impact of algorithm design choices on the system-wide energy dissipation, area, and latency. These functions are used to either optimize the energy performance or provide tradeoffs for a family of candidate algorithms and architectures. For selected designs, we perform extensive low-level simulations using state-of-the-art tools and target FPGA devices. We show a design space for matrix multiplication on FPGAs that results in tradeoffs among energy, area, and latency. For example, our designs improve the energy performance of state-of-the-art FPGA-based designs by 29%-51% without any increase in the area-latency product. The latency of our designs is reduced one-third to one-fifteenth while area is increased 1.9-9.4 times. In terms of comprehensive metrics such as Energy-Area-Time, our designs exhibit superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art by 50%-79%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/33194/01564083.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Energy- and time-efficient matrix multiplication on FPGAs","volume":"13","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8714413","htmlLink":"/document/1564083/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy- and time-efficient matrix multiplication on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01564083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122232S","chronDate":"Nov.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"33194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"33194","articleId":"1564083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1564093,"authors":[{"name":"Yibing Wang","affiliation":["Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory, Department of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/33195/1564093/1564093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yibing Wang (M'04) received the Ph.D. degree in automatic control engineering from Tsinghua University, China, in 1998.","From 1999 to 2001, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory, Department of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete, Greece.

This paper presents two motion estimation algorithms using Kalman filter to further enhance the performance of the conventional R-D motion estimation at a relative low computational cost. The Kalman filter exploits the correlation of block motion to achieve higher precision of motion estimation and compensation. In the first algorithm, the Kalman filter is utilized as a postprocessing to raise the motion compensation accuracy of the conventional R-D motion estimation. In the second algorithm, the Kalman filter is embedded into the optimization process of R-D motion estimation by defining a new R-D criterion. It further improves the rate-distortion performance significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/33196/01564119.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.857287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.857287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman filtering based rate-constrained motion estimation for very low bit rate video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Filtering","Motion estimation","Bit rate","Video coding","Rate distortion theory","Motion compensation","Decoding","Computational efficiency","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","filtering theory","motion estimation","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filtering","rate-constrained motion estimation","very low bit rate video coding","block-matching algorithm","motion compensation","optimization process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kalman filter","motion model","R-D motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Kalman filtering based rate-constrained motion estimation for very low bit rate video coding","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564119/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8722297","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman filtering based rate-constrained motion estimation for very low bit rate video coding","sourcePdf":"01564119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095446S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"33196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33196","articleId":"1564119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1564125,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The detection technique was tested on the TRECVID2003 video test set having different types of shots and containing significant object and camera motion inside the shots. It is demonstrated that the method detects both fades and abrupt cuts with high accuracy. The information theory measure provides us with better results because it exploits the inter-frame information in a more compact way than frame subtraction.

Using block-wise maximum-likelihood (ML) disparity estimation, it was found that the Laplacian model outperformed the Cauchy and Gaussian models in terms of disparity compensation errors and the number of correspondence matches. The disparity values in occluded regions were then determined using both object-based and reliability-based interpolation. Finally, an adaptive technique was used to interpolate the intermediate views. One distinguishing characteristic of this algorithm is that the left and right-eye images were projected onto the plane of the intermediate view to be reconstructed. This resulted in two projected images. The intermediate view was created using a weighted average of these two projected images with the weights based on the quality of the corresponding areas of the projected images. Subjective examination of the reconstructed images indicate that they have high image quality and good stable depth when viewed stereoscopically. An objective evaluation with the test image sequence \"Flower Garden\" shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of around 1 dB, when compared to a reference algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.857785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/33196/01564127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.857785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33196","startPage":"102","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive reconstruction of intermediate views from stereoscopic images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive reconstruction of intermediate views from stereoscopic images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8722305","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564127/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive reconstruction of intermediate views from stereoscopic images","sourcePdf":"01564127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078644S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"33196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33196","articleId":"1564127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1564130,"authors":[{"name":"P.

One of the questions that arises is how to assess these different video coding technologies in terms of compression efficiency. In this paper, several compression schemes are compared by means of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and just noticeable difference (JND). The codecs examined are XviD 0.9.1 (conform to the MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile), DivX 5.1 (implementing the MPEG-4 Visual Advanced Simple Profile), Windows Media Video 9, MC-EZBC and H.264/AVC AHM 2.0 (version JM 6.1 of the reference software, extended with rate control). The latter plays a key role in this comparison because the H.264/AVC standard can be considered as the de facto benchmark in the field of digital video coding. The obtained results show that H.264/AVC AHM 2.0 outperforms current proprietary and standards-based implementations in almost all cases. Another observation is that the choice of a particular quality metric can influence general statements about the relation between the different codecs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8722308","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564130/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rate-distortion performance of H.264/AVC compared to state-of-the-art video codecs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-distortion performance of H.264/AVC compared to state-of-the-art video codecs","sourcePdf":"01564130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100807S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"33196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33196","articleId":"1564130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1564131,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This results in carrier suppression, 1/2 the bandwidth of standard nonreturn-to-zero, and high tolerance to positive and negative dispersion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/33197/01564163.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2005.862358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2005.862358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chirp-managed directly modulated laser (CML)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp modulation","Distributed feedback devices","Optical filters","Optical transmitters","Frequency modulation","Laser feedback","Optical receivers","High speed optical techniques","Optical feedback","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","optical modulation","optical fibre communication","optical filters","chirp modulation","optical transmitters","optical pulse shaping","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation format","chirp-managed directly modulated laser","distributed feedback laser","optical filter","adiabatic chirp","filter edge response","extinction ratio pulses","phase shifts","carrier suppression","nonreturn-to-zero","10 Gbit/s","1.55 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude modulation (AM)","AM to FM conversion","bandpass filter","chirp","direct modulation","distributed feedback lasers","duobinary","frequency modulation (FM)","FM to AM conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 15,  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Chirp-managed directly modulated laser (CML)","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1564163/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 15, 2006","accessionNumber":"8811907","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chirp-managed directly modulated laser (CML)","sourcePdf":"01564163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041759S","chronDate":"Jan. 15,  2006","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"33197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"33197","articleId":"1564163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1564164,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An algorithm is presented that shows significant improvement in sensitivity on internal faults while still maintaining a high level of stability on external faults and nonfault events.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2005.848654","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/33198/01564179.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2005.848654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CT saturation detection algorithm using symmetrical components for current differential protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A CT saturation detection algorithm using symmetrical components for current differential protection","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8712050","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1564179/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CT saturation detection algorithm using symmetrical components for current differential protection","sourcePdf":"01564179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05992S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"33198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"33198","articleId":"1564179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1564199,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The inaccuracy is due to the fact that the instantaneous power of the ac-side inductors is assumed to be negligible in the power balance equation. This paper shows that this assumption obscures (i) the impact of operating point which is a direct consequence of the inherent nonlinear nature of the problem and (ii) the nonminimum-phase property of the plant in the rectifying mode of operation. Thus, the conventional dc-side control model may lead to unsatisfactory performance or even instability. To overcome the shortcoming, this paper also develops accurate nonlinear and linearized models for the dc-side controller design, including the impact of the ac-side interface reactors. The analytical results and the conclusions are validated by digital time-domain simulation of a study system in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.

Wavelet transform is utilized to extract feature vectors for various PQ disturbances based on the multiresolution analysis (MRA). These feature vectors then are applied to a SOLAR system for training and testing. SOLAR has three advantageous over a typical neural network: data driven learning, local interconnections and entropy based self-organization. Several typical PQ disturbances are taken into consideration in this paper. Comparison research between the proposed method, the support vector machine (SVM) method and existing literature reports show that the proposed method can provide accurate classification results. By the hypothesis test of the averages, it is shown that there is no statistically significant difference in performance of the proposed method for PQ classification when different wavelets are chosen. This means one can choose the wavelet with short wavelet filter length to achieve good classification results as well as small computational cost. Gaussian white noise is considered and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the performance of the proposed method in different noise conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2005.852392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/33198/01564211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2005.852392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33198","startPage":"286","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-organizing learning array system for power quality classification based on wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A self-organizing learning array system for power quality classification based on wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8712082","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564211/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-organizing learning array system for power quality classification based on wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"01564211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096695S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"33198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"33198","articleId":"1564211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564216,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this approach, NNs are trained to extract important features from the input current waveform to uniquely identify various types of devices using their distinct harmonic \"signatures\". Such automated, noninvasive device identification will be critical in future power-quality monitoring and enhancement systems. Several NN-based classification models including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels were developed for signature extraction and device identification. These models were trained and tested using spike train data gathered from the Fourier analysis of the input current waveform in the presence of multiple devices. The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy. MLP was found to be the best signature identification method because of its low computational requirements and ability to extract the information necessary for highly accurate device identification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8712095","htmlLink":"/document/1564224/","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based signature recognition for harmonic source identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based signature recognition for harmonic source identification","sourcePdf":"01564224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086445S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"33198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"299","xplore-issue":"33198","articleId":"1564224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":1564225,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

Conventionally, the compensation currents injected by the shunt APF are determined to eliminate harmonic currents of the load. However, when considering different APF performance indices such as minimizing source current distortion and maximizing compensated load power factor, the issues related to sizing the APF to meet IEEE-519 harmonic current limits and other constraints such as current imbalance limits and minimum load power factor requirement are rarely investigated. In the paper, a new theory of APF control in the a-b-c reference frame is proposed to determine the APF current injections to meet different constraints with an optimal APF size, where the filter control strategy is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and is solved to find the optimal current injections. Results obtained by simulations with Matlab/Simulink show that the proposed approach is more flexible and effective than the conventional approaches on compensating reactive power and harmonic currents of the load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564225/","accessionNumber":"8712096","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for optimal shunt active power filter control considering alternative performance indices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for optimal shunt active power filter control considering alternative performance indices","sourcePdf":"01564225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060765S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"33198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"33198","articleId":"1564225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1564226,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As a result, the focus of harmonic control inevitably shifts from the local load to a network-wide level. Limitations and difficulties associated with passive filters have led to the proposal of active power-line conditioners as a method of network-wide harmonic control. This paper presents a control scheme which systematically brings network-wide harmonic levels within specified limits based solely on feedback information, thereby eliminating the requirement for a priori network impedance information. This proposed scheme offers substantial computational savings over full nonlinear optimization while achieving near-optimum results.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2005.852343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/33198/01564228.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2005.852343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online control of an APLC for network-wide harmonic reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564228/","displayDocTitle":"Online control of an APLC for network-wide harmonic reduction","volume":"21","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564228/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8712099","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online control of an APLC for network-wide harmonic reduction","sourcePdf":"01564228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085291S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"33198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33198","articleId":"1564228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564235,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Jiang","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Shan Jiang (S'04) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

In particular, this paper proposes multiple leaf code reservation (MLCR) schemes, where different numbers of orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) leaf codes (i.e., codes of the lowest layer of the OVSF code tree) are reserved to differentiate users with different bandwidth requirements. Leaf codes are only reserved for as long as the call admission process lasts. Once the decision of whether a new request is admitted or not has been made, a Code Dereservation procedure is carried out to increase flexibility in the code assignment phase. The performance of these MLCR strategies with/without code reassignments is then evaluated. Analysis shows that MLCR schemes are also useful in improving fair access among different traffic classes. In addition, perfect fair access among requests with different data rates can be achieved when code reassignments are jointly employed with the proposed OVSF-code reservation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","startPage":"26","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call admission and code allocation strategies for WCDMA systems with multirate traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Call admission and code allocation strategies for WCDMA systems with multirate traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828368","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564268/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call admission and code allocation strategies for WCDMA systems with multirate traffic","sourcePdf":"01564268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070811S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1564269,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The current CDMA2000 1/spl times/EV-DV standard specifies all possible combinations of system parameters, but there is no any further specification in the standard on how to dynamically change the system parameters to support the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements imposed by the upper-layer applications. In the meantime, one of the major deficiencies of previous research work done in this area is that they all are based on the channel models of physical layer such as Rayleigh model, which is unable to capture the link-layer QoS parameters such as queueing delay. Since the dynamic resource allocation usually resides in the data link layer, a wireless channel model at the link layer would be desirable to handle the QoS requirements. In this paper, we develop a dynamic resource allocation scheme using the effective capacity link model to support delay-bounded multimedia services in CDMA2000 1/spl times/EV-DV networks. Extensive simulations have been set up and the simulation results show that the proposed dynamic resource allocation scheme significantly improves the delay and throughput performance for all types of application traffic with various QoS requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564270.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic resource allocation scheme for delay-constrained multimedia services in CDMA 1/spl times/EV-DV forward link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Multiaccess communication","Time division multiplexing","Modulation coding","Quality of service","Physical layer","Delay effects","Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","delays","multimedia communication","3G mobile communication","time division multiplexing","code division multiplexing","adaptive modulation","modulation coding","wireless channels","channel coding","channel capacity","telecommunication traffic","quality of service","code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic resource allocation","delay-constrained multimedia service","CDMA2000","1/spl times/EV-DV forward link","third-generation networks","time division multiplexing","TDM","code division multiplexing","CDM","adaptive modulation-coding","AMC technique","data rate enhancement","quality-of-service","QoS","wireless channel model","traffic application","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel capacity","delay-bounded dynamic resource allocation","effective capacity (EC)","quality-of-service (QoS)","CDMA2000 1"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic resource allocation scheme for delay-constrained multimedia services in CDMA 1/spl times/EV-DV forward link","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564270/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828370","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic resource allocation scheme for delay-constrained multimedia services in CDMA 1/spl times/EV-DV forward link","sourcePdf":"01564270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068445S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1564271,"authors":[{"name":"T.

By using a two-state (good-bad) Gilbert channel to represent the outage behavior, the model parameters and satisfied-user probability for both speech and data sessions are derived for different uplink and downlink scenarios.

Therefore, by using different N, the IFW width of a GPC code set can be adjusted with its set size unchanged. Each GPC code set consists of two code groups, with each having K codes, and they have sparsely and uniformly distributed autocorrelation side lobes and cross-correlation levels outside the IFWs.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","startPage":"65","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized pairwise complementary codes with set-wise uniform interference-free windows","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized pairwise complementary codes with set-wise uniform interference-free windows","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828372","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564272/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized pairwise complementary codes with set-wise uniform interference-free windows","sourcePdf":"01564272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147803S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564273,"authors":[{"name":"Lung-Sheng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/33199/1564273/1564273-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lung-Sheng Tsai (S'05) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, 1980.

However, the problem of minimizing intercell interference (ICI) in a cellular QS-CDMA system remains an open issue. Addressing the problem from a sequence design viewpoint, the key challenge is how to generalize the known construction of a single LS code to the design of many families of generalized LS (GLS) codes so that a desirable code family can be selected for the realization of a low-ICI cellular QS-CDMA system. Our main contribution is a systematic construction of new families of GLS codes with favorable intercode cross-correlation properties within a certain window, while maintaining the desirable IFW property. Many such code families can be obtained from our construction by choosing different Hadamard matrices and different uncorrelated complementary pairs. Their effectiveness with respect to some meaningful evaluation criteria are compared. In particular, by a simplified system bit-error rate analysis, it is demonstrated that a new GLS code family significantly outperforms the conventional scrambled LS codes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858877","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564274.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of spreading codes for quasi-synchronous CDMA with intercell interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of spreading codes for quasi-synchronous CDMA with intercell interference","volume":"24","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8828374","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564274/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564274/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of spreading codes for quasi-synchronous CDMA with intercell interference","sourcePdf":"01564274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110056S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564275,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Applying this TSD/MRC-based scheme, the transmitter jointly selects the optimal subcarrier-and-antenna pair to significantly decrease the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is one of the main problems inherently associated with MC DS-CDMA communications. Over the frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading channels, we develop the unified analytical framework to analyze the symbol-error rate (SER) of the scheme implemented in different types of wireless networks, while dealing with the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) feedbacks, respectively. The imperfect feedbacks we focus on include delayed feedbacks and erroneous feedbacks. Taking the imperfectness of the feedback into account, the resultant SER is compared with that of both conventional selection diversity (SD)/MRC-based and space-time block coding (STBC)/MRC-based schemes. Our analyses show that in a wide variation of the feedback imperfectness, our proposed TSD/MRC-based scheme has significant advantages over the other two schemes for both downlink cellular networks and ad hoc wireless networks. However, our analytical findings indicate that TSD/MRC-based scheme cannot always outperform SD/MRC-based and STBC/MRC-based schemes even when the perfect CSI feedbacks are available.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564276.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","startPage":"104","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit selection diversity with maximal-ratio combining for multicarrier DS-CDMA wireless networks over Nakagami-m fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmit selection diversity with maximal-ratio combining for multicarrier DS-CDMA wireless networks over Nakagami-m fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828376","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564276/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit selection diversity with maximal-ratio combining for multicarrier DS-CDMA wireless networks over Nakagami-m fading channels","sourcePdf":"01564276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081466S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564277,"authors":[{"name":"Jibing Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/33199/1564277/1564277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jibing Wang (S'98-M'03) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California.

In the considered scheme, each user employs LD codes to transmit the data, i.e., the transmitted codeword is a linear combination over space and time of certain dispersion matrices with the transmitted symbols. The linear space-time spreading can also be utilized to separate multiple users at the base station. We propose a simulation-based optimization method together with gradient estimation to systematically design the multiuser linear space-time coding under either optimal or suboptimal receivers. We perform the gradient estimation through the score function method. The proposed method can also be applied to design codes under different fading statistics. Simulation results show that under the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, the codes obtained by the new algorithm provides roughly the same performance as the low-dimensional spread modulation, as well as the interference-resistant modulation. Moreover, the new codes perform significantly better with suboptimal multiuser receiver structures.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal linear space-time spreading for multiuser MIMO communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal linear space-time spreading for multiuser MIMO communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828377","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal linear space-time spreading for multiuser MIMO communications","sourcePdf":"01564277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116076S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1564278,"authors":[{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/33199/1564278/1564278-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nLie-Liang Yang (M'98-SM'02) received the B.

The main objective is to improve the capacity of the existing direct-sequence (DS)-CDMA systems, for example, for supporting an increased number of users, by deploying multiple transmit and receive antennas in the corresponding systems and by using some advanced transmission and detection algorithms. In the proposed MIMO SCDMA system, each user can be distinguished jointly by its spreading code signature and its unique channel impulse response (CIR) transfer function referred to as spatial signature. Hence, the number of users might be supported by the MIMO SCDMA system and the corresponding achievable performance are determined by the degrees of freedom provided by both the code signatures and the spatial signatures, as well as by how efficiently the degrees of freedom are exploited. Specifically, the number of users supported by the proposed MIMO SCDMA can be significantly higher than the number of chips per bit, owing to the employment of space-division. In this contribution, space-time spreading is employed for configuring the transmitted signals. Three types of low-complexity linear detectors, namely, correlation, decorrelating, and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are considered for detecting the MIMO SCDMA signals. The bit-error rate performance of the MIMO SCDMA system associated with these linear detectors are evaluated by simulations, when assuming that the MIMO SCDMA signals are transmitted over multipath Rayleigh-fading channels. Our study and simulation results show that MIMO SCDMA assisted by multiuser detection is capable of facilitating joint space-time despreading, multipath combining, and receiver diversity combining, while simultaneously suppressing the multiuser interfering signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564278.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-assisted space-code-division multiple-access: linear detectors and performance over multipath fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Fading","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Diversity reception","Receiving antennas","Detection algorithms","Transfer functions","Employment","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","space-time codes","code division multiple access","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication","transient response","transfer functions","Rayleigh channels","radio receivers","diversity reception","radiofrequency interference","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","channel coding","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input-multiple-output system","MIMO","space-code-division multiple-access","SCDMA","linear detector","multipath fading channel","direct-sequence DS-CDMA system","multiple transmit antenna","multiple receive antenna","channel impulse response","CIR transfer function","spatial signature","degrees-of-freedom","minimum mean-square error","MMSE","bit-error rate","Rayleigh-fading channel","multiuser detection","receiver diversity combining","signal interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-division multiple access (CDMA)","multipath-fading channels","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","multiuser detection","space-division multiple access (SDMA)","space\u2013time spreading (STS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-assisted space-code-division multiple-access: linear detectors and performance over multipath fading channels","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564278/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828378","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-assisted space-code-division multiple-access: linear detectors and performance over multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"01564278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0767S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1564279,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqing Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/33199/1564279/1564279-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiqing Zhou (M\u2019 04) was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1975.

In this paper, a hybrid multicode interference cancellation (MCI) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection scheme is presented for the turbo-coded OFCDM systems. Channel estimation based on a code-multiplexed pilot channel is employed. The weights of the hybrid detection are derived theoretically and an effective method to generate the weights in practical applications is proposed. By means of computer simulation, the effects of system parameters on the performance are studied extensively. It is shown that the hybrid detection outperforms pure MMSE detection in various channel conditions, especially for high-level modulation schemes. To carry out interference regeneration for the hybrid detection, the conventional turbo decoding algorithm which only decodes systematic bits should be extended to decode parity bits as well. Moreover, two iterations in turbo decoding are sufficient to provide good performance for the system with the multistage hybrid detection. Finally, given time-domain spreading factor N/sub T/, the system performance improves with frequency-domain spreading factor N/sub F/.

Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), multicode operation and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) will be the enabling technologies. With such high-speed data transmissions, however, multicode operation severely suffers from the loss of orthogonality among the spreading codes since the wireless channel becomes severely frequency-selective. In this paper, we apply frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion instead of conventional rake combining for receiving the packet. A new MMSE-FDE weight is derived for packet combining. The throughput in a frequency-selective Rayleigh-fading channel is evaluated by computer simulation for Chase combining and incremental redundancy (IR) packet combining. It is shown that the use of MMSE-FDE for the reception of multicode DS-CDMA packet gives an improved throughput irrespective of the channel's frequency-selectivity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet access using DS-CDMA with frequency-domain equalization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.858899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/33199/01564282.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.858899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33199","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Packet access using DS-CDMA with frequency-domain equalization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564282/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8828382","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet access using DS-CDMA with frequency-domain equalization","sourcePdf":"01564282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143647S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"33199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33199","articleId":"1564282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1564284,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We consider the expectation maximization algorithm, as well as the space alternating generalized expectation maximization algorithm as tools to develop code-aided estimation algorithms for a variety of scenarios.

The key idea is to exploit the asymmetric logical masking probabilities of gates, hardening gates that have the lowest logical masking probability to achieve cost-effective tradeoffs between overhead and soft error failure rate reduction. The asymmetry in the logical masking probabilities at a gate is leveraged by decoupling the physical from the logical (Boolean) aspects of soft error susceptibility of the gate. Gates are hardened to single-event upsets (SEUs) with specified worst case characteristics in increasing order of their logical masking probability, thereby maximizing the reduction in the soft error failure rate for specified overhead costs (area, power, and delay). Gate sizing for radiation hardening uses a novel gate (transistor) sizing technique that is both efficient and accurate. A full set of experimental results for process technologies ranging from 180 to 70 nm demonstrates the cost-effective tradeoffs that can be achieved. On average, the proposed technique has a radiation hardening overhead of 38.3%, 27.1%, and 3.8% in area, power, and delay for worst case SEUs across the four process technologies.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.853696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33200/01564311.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.853696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate sizing to radiation harden combinational logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Gate sizing to radiation harden combinational logic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564311/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8707653","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564311/","volume":"25","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate sizing to radiation harden combinational logic","sourcePdf":"01564311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156022S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"33200","articleId":"1564311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1564312,"authors":[{"name":"Josh Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/33200/1564312/1564312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Josh Yang received the B.S. degree in science engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1987, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the San Jose State University, CA, in 1992.","He worked as a Design Engineer at Mosel Vitelic Incorporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., and Sharp Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1991 and 1994, respectively.

This paper proposes a novel design-for-test (DFT) technique that allows SRAMs to be tested at full speed for these defects. As a result, it achieves not only significant test time reduction but also full coverage of open defects, including those undetectable to previous solutions. The proposed technique is referred to as predischarge write test mode (PDWTM). Implementation of the proposed technique requires little design effort and imposes negligible hardware and performance penalties. Furthermore, the proposed technique can be easily merged with any March algorithm, thus resulting in full DRF and other SRAM cell open defect coverage. The proposed technique has been validated by SPICE simulation using both low-power and high-speed SRAM cells.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/33200/01564312.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.852680","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.852680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast detection of data retention faults and other SRAM cell open defects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fast detection of data retention faults and other SRAM cell open defects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564312/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564312/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8707654","volume":"25","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast detection of data retention faults and other SRAM cell open defects","sourcePdf":"01564312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105446S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"33200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33200","articleId":"1564312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1564322,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Siemens Corporate Research, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA","University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Li Zhang","id":"37087276212"},{"name":"E.A.

Since lung function varies regionally and because pulmonary disease is usually not uniformly distributed in the lungs, it is useful to study the lungs on a lobe-by-lobe basis. Thus, it is important to segment not only the lungs, but the lobar fissures as well. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an anatomic pulmonary atlas, encoded with a priori information on the pulmonary anatomy, to automatically segment the oblique lobar fissures. Sixteen volumetric CT scans from 16 subjects are used to construct the pulmonary atlas. A ridgeness measure is applied to the original CT images to enhance the fissure contrast. Fissure detection is accomplished in two stages: an initial fissure search and a final fissure search. A fuzzy reasoning system is used in the fissure search to analyze information from three sources: the image intensity, an anatomic smoothness constraint, and the atlas-based search initialization. Our method has been tested on 22 volumetric thin-slice CT scans from 12 subjects, and the results are compared to manual tracings. Averaged across all 22 data sets, the RMS error between the automatically segmented and manually segmented fissures is 1.96/spl plusmn/0.71 mm and the mean of the similarity indices between the manually defined and computer-defined lobe regions is 0.988. The results indicate a strong agreement between the automatic and manual lobe segmentations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2005.859209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/33201/01564322.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2005.859209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Atlas-driven lung lobe segmentation in volumetric X-ray CT images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Atlas-driven lung lobe segmentation in volumetric X-ray CT images","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564322/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8717506","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","pubMedId":"16398410","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atlas-driven lung lobe segmentation in volumetric X-ray CT images","sourcePdf":"01564322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098015S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"33201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"33201","articleId":"1564322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1564328,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

In order to assign image regions to a cerebral tissue type, a spatial normalization between image data and standard probability maps is carried out, so that for each structure a maximum a posteriori probability criterion is applied. The method was applied to synthetic and real images, keeping all parameters constant throughout the process for each type of data. The combination of region segmentation and edge detection proved to be a robust technique, as adequate clusters were automatically identified, regardless of the noise level and bias.

The image is clustered in three parts: background, soft tissue, and bone using this model. Improvement in the visibility of both structures is achieved through a local transformation based on gamma correction, stretching, and saturation, which is applied using different parameters for bone and soft-tissue pixels. A processing time of 1 s for 5 Mpixel images allows the filter to operate in real time. Although the default value of the filter parameters is adequate for most images, real-time operation allows adjustment to recover under- and overexposed images or to obtain the best quality subjectively.

To keep the cell data state from being degraded by the word-line (WL) disturb due to the charge pumping and to reduce the refresh busy rate, a sense amplifier (S/A) is arranged for every bit-line (BL) and replenishes data \"1\" cells' bodies with holes which are lost by the disturb in every read and write cycle. The power is reduced by operating the S/As asymmetrically between the selected and the unselected thanks to that the number of holes to be replenished in the unselected S/As for charge pumping is two order of magnitude smaller than that required for writing the data \"1\". The multi-pair averaging of dummy cells generates a very accurate reference current for distinguishing the data \"1\" and \"0\" and a Monte Carlo simulation shows that it achieves a sensing scheme robust enough to realize all good parts of the DRAM with a reasonable amount of redundancy. The cell's feature of quasi-nondestructive read-out is also advantageous for making an SRAM interface of the DRAM or hiding refresh from uses without sacrificing the access time.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.0051.859018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/33202/01564354.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.0051.859018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a 128-mb SOI DRAM using the floating body cell (FBC)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of a 128-mb SOI DRAM using the floating body cell (FBC)","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564354/","accessionNumber":"8710509","volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a 128-mb SOI DRAM using the floating body cell (FBC)","sourcePdf":"01564354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126899S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"33202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33202","articleId":"1564354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564355,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Zhang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/33202/1564355/1564355-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kevin Zhang (S'92\u2013M'94) received the B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1987, and the Ph.D. degree from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 1994.","He is an Intel Fellow and Director of embedded memory circuit and technology integration at Portland Technology Development, Intel Corporation, where he is responsible for the lead vehicle development for future process and design technology development.

A hidden error-check-and-correction (HECC) scheme compensated the access time penalty caused by the ECC logic on the output critical path. And a multi-column ECC word assignment (MCE) increased the multi-bit-error immunity while using only 1-bit-correctable ECC which minimized area penalty. A source-level-adjusted direct sense amplifier (SLAD) and a write-replica circuit with an asymmetrical replica memory cell (WRAM) for the device-fluctuation-tolerant access control were also designed. A 130-nm CMOS 32-Kbit SRAM-macro was fabricated with these circuit techniques, which demonstrated: 1) 0.3-V operation with 6.8 MHz; 2) 30-MHz operation which is feasible for mobile use even at 0.4 V, while keeping 960MHz at 1.5 V; and 3) a reduction by 3.6/spl times/10/sup 5/ in soft-error rate compared with that of conventional ECC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564356/","volume":"41","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564356/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8710511","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A sub-0.5-V operating embedded SRAM featuring a multi-bit-error-immune hidden-ECC scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sub-0.5-V operating embedded SRAM featuring a multi-bit-error-immune hidden-ECC scheme","sourcePdf":"01564356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100068S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"33202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33202","articleId":"1564356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564357,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper proposes a simple circuit technique that adaptively trades off overhead energy for maximum leakage savings under severe leakage variations. The proposed run-time leakage reduction technique for on-die SRAM caches considers architectural access behavior to determine how often the SRAM blocks should enter a sleep mode. A self-decay circuit generates a periodic sleep pulse with an adaptive pulse period, which puts the SRAM array into a sleep mode more frequently at high leakage conditions (fast process, high temperature) and vice versa. An 0.18-/spl mu/m 1.8-V 16-kbyte SRAM testchip shows 94.2% reduction in SRAM cell leakage at a performance penalty less than 2%. Measurement results also indicate that our proposed memory cell improves SRAM static noise margin by 25%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PVT-aware leakage reduction for on-die caches with improved read stability","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.859315","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.859315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/33202/01564358.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"PVT-aware leakage reduction for on-die caches with improved read stability","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564358/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710513","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PVT-aware leakage reduction for on-die caches with improved read stability","sourcePdf":"01564358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06012S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"33202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33202","articleId":"1564358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564359,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

This system, referred to as Foxton Technology (FT), utilizes on-chip sensors and an embedded microcontroller to measure PT and modulate both voltage and frequency (VF) to optimize performance while meeting PT constraints. Changing both VF takes advantage of the cubic relationship of P/spl prop/CV/sup 2/F. We present measured results that show a 31% reduction in power for only a 10% drop in frequency. Montecito is able to implement FT using only 0.5% of the die area and 0.5% of the die power.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature control","Program processors","Frequency measurement","Linear feedback control systems","Temperature sensors","System-on-a-chip","Sensor systems","Microcontrollers","Voltage","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","microcontrollers","frequency control","voltage control","sensors","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","temperature control","Itanium Family processor","embedded feedback system","Montecito processor","Foxton Technology","on-chip sensors","embedded microcontroller","PT constraints","frequency scaling","power management","temperature management","voltage scaling","90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency scaling","power control","power management","temperature management","voltage scaling"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/33202/01564363.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.859902","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.859902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and temperature control on a 90-nm Itanium family processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564363/","displayDocTitle":"Power and temperature control on a 90-nm Itanium family processor","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710518","htmlLink":"/document/1564363/","volume":"41","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and temperature control on a 90-nm Itanium family processor","sourcePdf":"01564363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072708S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"33202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"33202","articleId":"1564363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564364,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

Additionally, a redundancy technique is introduced in this paper to further halve the residual voltage error of the samplers. A third technique, i.e., \"reference subtraction,\" is applied to remove cross-channel correlated dynamic noise. The resulting phase spacing is only limited by the uncorrelated random noise in the system.

The proposed hybrid clock distribution network and DLL provide digital noise-free and low-jitter clock signals by utilizing lossless package layer interconnections instead of lossy on-chip global wires with cascaded repeaters. The lossless package layer interconnections become high-frequency waveguides and provide a repeater-free clock distribution network; thus, the clock signal becomes free of on-chip power supply noise. The proposed chip-package hybrid clock scheme has demonstrated a 78-ps peak-to-peak jitter at 500 MHz under a 240-mV on-chip simultaneous switching noise condition versus a conventional clock scheme, which produced a 172-ps peak-to-peak jitter under the same condition. Moreover, the proposed scheme has demonstrated an 80-ps long-term jitter with a 300-mV DC voltage drop test condition, contrasted with the 380-ps long-term jitter of a conventional clock scheme.

Repeaters can partly bridge this gap, but the classical repeater insertion approach requires a large number of repeaters while the intrinsic data capacity of each interconnect-segment is only partially used. In this paper we analyze interconnects and show how a combination of layout, termination and equalization techniques can significantly increase the data rate for a given length of uninterrupted interconnect. To validate these techniques, a bus-transceiver test chip in a 0.13-/spl mu/m, 1.2-V, 6-M copper CMOS process has been designed. The chip uses 10-mm-long differential interconnects with wire widths and spacing of only 0.4 /spl mu/m. Differential interconnects are insensitive to common-mode disturbances (e.g., non-neighbor crosstalk) and enable the use of twists to mitigate neighbor-to-neighbor crosstalk. With transceivers operating in conventional mode, the chip achieves only 0.55 Gb/s/ch.

For a square cavity with side length of 2 /spl mu/m and refractive index of 3.2, the mode Q-factor can increase 13 times as the perfect corners are replaced by a quarter of circle with radius of 0.3 /spl mu/m. Furthermore the blue shift with the increasing deformations is found as a result of the reduction in effective resonator area. In square cavities with periodic roughness at sidewalls which maintains the symmetry of the square, the Q-factors of the whispering gallery (WG)-like modes are still one order of magnitude larger that those of non-WG-like modes. However, the Q-factors of these two types of modes are of the same order in the square cavity with random roughness.

The dynamic updating of population leads to a larger virtual population size and quicker response to change of population status. Two trial functions have been minimized using the dynamic differential evolution strategy. Comparison with the differential evolution strategy has been carried out. It has been observed that the dynamic differential evolution strategy significantly outperforms the differential evolution strategy in efficiency, robustness, and memory requirement.

The basic principle is to select pixels of the same scattering characteristics to be included in the filtering process. To achieve this, the algorithm first applies the Freeman and Durden decomposition to separate pixels into three dominant scattering categories: surface, double bounce, and volume, and then unsupervised classification is applied. Speckle filtering is performed using the classification map as a mask. A single-look or multilook pixel centered in a 9 /spl times/ 9 window is filtered by including only pixels in the same and two neighboring classes from the same scattering category. This filter is effective in speckle reduction, while perfectly preserving strong point target signatures, and retains edges, linear, and curved features in the POLSAR data. The effect of speckle filtering on scattering characteristics, such as entropy, anisotropy, and alpha angle, will be discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2005.859338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/33204/01564407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.859338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33204","startPage":"176","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering-model-based speckle filtering of polarimetric SAR data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scattering-model-based speckle filtering of polarimetric SAR data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710755","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564407/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering-model-based speckle filtering of polarimetric SAR data","sourcePdf":"01564407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07687S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"33204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"33204","articleId":"1564407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1564408,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This paper deals with the problem of probability density function (pdf) estimation in the context of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude data analysis. Several theoretical and heuristic models for the pdfs of SAR data have been proposed in the literature, which have been proved to be effective for different land-cover typologies, thus making the choice of a single optimal parametric pdf a hard task, especially when dealing with heterogeneous SAR data. In this paper, an innovative estimation algorithm is described, which faces such a problem by adopting a finite mixture model for the amplitude pdf, with mixture components belonging to a given dictionary of SAR-specific pdfs. The proposed method automatically integrates the procedures of selection of the optimal model for each component, of parameter estimation, and of optimization of the number of components by combining the stochastic expectation-maximization iterative methodology with the recently developed \"method-of-log-cumulants\" for parametric pdf estimation in the case of nonnegative random variables. Experimental results on several real SAR images are reported, showing that the proposed method accurately models the statistics of SAR amplitude data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dictionary-based stochastic expectation-maximization for SAR amplitude probability density function estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2005.859349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/33204/01564408.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.859349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Dictionary-based stochastic expectation-maximization for SAR amplitude probability density function estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564408/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710756","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dictionary-based stochastic expectation-maximization for SAR amplitude probability density function estimation","sourcePdf":"01564408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119777S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"33204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"33204","articleId":"1564408","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564423,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

However, in general, the problem of finding sparse representations must be unstable in the presence of noise. This paper establishes the possibility of stable recovery under a combination of sufficient sparsity and favorable structure of the overcomplete system. Considering an ideal underlying signal that has a sufficiently sparse representation, it is assumed that only a noisy version of it can be observed. Assuming further that the overcomplete system is incoherent, it is shown that the optimally sparse approximation to the noisy data differs from the optimally sparse decomposition of the ideal noiseless signal by at most a constant multiple of the noise level. As this optimal-sparsity method requires heavy (combinatorial) computational effort, approximation algorithms are considered. It is shown that similar stability is also available using the basis and the matching pursuit algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that these methods result in sparse approximation of the noisy data that contains only terms also appearing in the unique sparsest representation of the ideal noiseless sparse signal.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.860430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/33205/01564423.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.860430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable recovery of sparse overcomplete representations in the presence of noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stable recovery of sparse overcomplete representations in the presence of noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564423/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8710582","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564423/","volume":"52","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable recovery of sparse overcomplete representations in the presence of noise","sourcePdf":"01564423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135269S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1327","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1564425,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Specifically, if b/sub 1/b/sub 2/...b/sub n/ is a sequence of bits sent across an optical channel, such that b/sub k/=b/sub l/=b/sub m/=1 for some k,l,m (not necessarily all distinct) but b/sub k+l-m/=0, then the ghost-pulse effect causes b/sub k+l-m/ to change to 1, thereby creating an error. Such errors do not occur if the sequence of bits satisfies the following constraint: for all integers k,l,m such that b/sub k/=b/sub l/=b/sub m/=1, we have b/sub k+l-m/=1. We call this the binary ghost-pulse (BGP) constraint. We will show, however, that the BGP constraint has zero capacity, implying that sequences satisfying this constraint cannot carry much information. Consequently, we consider a more sophisticated coding scheme, which uses ternary sequences satisfying a certain ternary ghost-pulse (TGP) constraint. We further relax these constraints by ignoring interactions between symbols that are more than a certain distance t apart in the transmitted sequence. Analysis of the resulting BGP(t) and TGP(t) constraints shows that these have nonzero capacities, and furthermore, the TGP(t)-constrained codes can achieve rates that are significantly higher than those for the corresponding BGP(t) codes. We also discuss the design of encoders and decoders for coding into the BGP, BGP(t), and TGP(t) constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","volume":"52","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8710586","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564427/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coding for the optical channel: the ghost-pulse constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for the optical channel: the ghost-pulse constraint","sourcePdf":"01564427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161771S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1564428,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the setting where a codeword spans a finite number N of fading degrees of freedom, we show that coded modulations of rate R bit per complex dimension, over a finite signal set /spl chi//spl sube//spl Copf/ of size 2/sup M/, achieve the optimal rate-diversity tradeoff given by the Singleton bound /spl delta/(N,M,R)=1+/spl lfloor/N(1-R/M)/spl rfloor/, for R/spl isin/(0,M/spl rfloor/. Furthermore, we show also that the popular bit-interleaved coded modulation achieves the same optimal rate-diversity tradeoff. We present a novel coded modulation construction based on blockwise concatenation that systematically yields Singleton-bound achieving turbo-like codes defined over an arbitrary signal set /spl chi//spl sub//spl Copf/. The proposed blockwise concatenation significantly outperforms conventional serial and parallel turbo codes in the block-fading channel. We analyze the ensemble average performance under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of the proposed codes by means of upper bounds and tight approximations. We show that, differently from the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fully interleaved fading cases, belief-propagation iterative decoding performs very close to ML on the block-fading channel for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and even for relatively short block lengths. We also show that, at constant decoding complexity per information bit, the proposed codes perform close to the information outage probability for any block length, while standard block codes (e.g., obtained by trellis termination of convolutional codes) have a gap from outage that increases with the block length: this is a different and more subtle manifestation of the so-called \"interleaving gain\" of turbo codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","volume":"52","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8710588","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1564429/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coded modulation in the block-fading channel: coding theorems and code construction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded modulation in the block-fading channel: coding theorems and code construction","sourcePdf":"01564429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137955S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1564430,"authors":[{"name":"Xinjia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"lastName":"Xinjia Chen","id":"37366056800"},{"name":"Kemin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"lastName":"Kemin Zhou","id":"37330231900"},{"name":"J.L.

The design of the new codes is accomplished in a systematic way through the optimization of a performance index that closely describes the bit-error rate as a function of the SNR. The new performance index is computationally simple and we have derived analytical expressions for its gradient with respect to constellation parameters. Decoding of the proposed constellations is reduced to a set of one-dimensional closest point problems that we solve using parallel sphere decoder algorithms.

We have a directed graph G=(V,E), where V={v/sub 0/v/sub 1/...v/sub n/} and E/spl sube/V/spl times/V. If (v/sub i/,v/sub j/)/spl isin/E, then node i can send messages to node j over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) (X/sub ij/,p/sub ij/(y|x),Y/sub ij/), of capacity C/sub ij/. The channels are independent. Each node v/sub i/ gets to observe a source of information U/sub i/(i=0...M), with joint distribution p(U/sub 0/U/sub 1/...U/sub M/). Our goal is to solve an incast problem in G: nodes exchange messages with their neighbors, and after a finite number of communication rounds, one of the M+1 nodes (v/sub 0/ by convention) must have received enough information to reproduce the entire field of observations (U/sub 0/U/sub 1/...U/sub M/), with arbitrarily small probability of error. In this paper, we prove that such perfect reconstruction is possible if and only if H(U/sub s/ | U/sub S(c)/) < /spl Sigma//sub i/spl isin/S,j/spl isin/S(c)/ for all S/spl sube/{0...M},S/spl ne/O,0/spl isin/S(c). Our main finding is that in this setup, a general source/channel separation theorem holds, and that Shannon information behaves as a classical network flow, identical in nature to the flow of water in pipes. At first glance, it might seem surprising that separation holds in a fairly general network situation like the one we study. A closer look, however, reveals that the reason for this is that our model allows only for independent point-to-point channels between pairs of nodes, and not multiple-access and/or broadcast channels, for which separation is well known not to hold. This \"information as flow\" view provides an algorithmic interpretation for our results, among which perhaps the most important one is the optimality of implementing codes using a layered protocol stack.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.860435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/33205/01564432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.860435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33205","startPage":"155","endPage":"170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network information flow with correlated sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Network information flow with correlated sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710591","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network information flow with correlated sources","sourcePdf":"01564432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09071S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564433,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two sequences of the same length are said to be of the same universal (LZ) type if and only if they yield the same dictionary (or, equivalently, parsing tree) in the incremental parsing of Ziv and Lempel (1978). It is shown that for any finite order k, the variational distance between the kth-order empirical probability distributions of two sequences of the same universal type vanishes as the sequence length tends to infinity. Consequently, for any k and any kth-order probability assignment, the difference between the normalized logarithms of the probabilities assigned to two sequences of the same universal type also vanishes asymptotically. The size of a universal type class is studied, and it is shown that its asymptotic behavior parallels that of the conventional counterpart, with the LZ78 code length playing the role of the empirical entropy. The number of universal types for sequences of length n is estimated, and shown to be of the form exp((1+o(1))gamman/logn) for a well characterized constant gamma.

There are several approaches to the construction of secret sharing schemes. One of them is based on coding theory. In principle, every linear code can be used to construct secret sharing schemes. But determining the access structure is very hard as this requires the complete characterization of the minimal codewords of the underlying linear code, which is a difficult problem in general. In this paper, a sufficient condition for all nonzero codewords of a linear code to be minimal is derived from exponential sums. Some linear codes whose covering structure can be determined are constructed, and then used to construct secret sharing schemes with nice access structures.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.860412","startPage":"206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/33205/01564435.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.860412","endPage":"212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret sharing schemes from three classes of linear codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Secret sharing schemes from three classes of linear codes","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564435/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8710594","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret sharing schemes from three classes of linear codes","sourcePdf":"01564435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077433S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564437,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangxin Chen","affiliation":["UBS, Prediction Company, Santa Fe, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Jiangxin Chen","id":"37280679200"},{"name":"P.H.

The channel model is assumed to be (transmit) correlated Rayleigh flat-fading with unequal powers. The SINR can be decomposed into two independent random variables: SINR=SINR/sup ZF/+T, where SINR/sup ZF/ corresponds to the SINR for a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and has an exact Gamma distribution. This correspondence focuses on characterizing the statistical properties of T using the results from random matrix theory. First three asymptotic moments of T are derived for uncorrelated channels and channels with equicorrelations. For general correlated channels, some limiting upper bounds for the first three moments are also provided. For uncorrelated channels and correlated channels satisfying certain conditions, it is proved that T converges to a Normal random variable. A Gamma distribution and a generalized Gamma distribution are proposed as approximations to the finite sample distribution of T. Simulations suggest that these approximate distributions can be used to estimate accurately the probability of errors even for very small dimensions (e.g., two transmit antennas).","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.860466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/33205/01564443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.860466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33205","startPage":"271","endPage":"286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the distribution of SINR for the MMSE MIMO receiver and performance analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the distribution of SINR for the MMSE MIMO receiver and performance analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710602","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1564443/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the distribution of SINR for the MMSE MIMO receiver and performance analysis","sourcePdf":"01564443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109179S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564444,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

noise (AWGN) channel with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signaling. By a reliability-order-based decoding algorithm (ROBDA), we mean a soft-decision decoding algorithm which decodes to the best (most likely) codeword of the form that is the sum of the hard-decision tuple and an error pattern in a set determined only by the order of the reliabilities of the hard decisions. Examples of ROBDAs include many well-known decoding algorithms, such as the generalized-minimum-distance (GMD) decoding algorithm, Chase decoding algorithms, and the reliability-based decoding algorithms proposed by Fossorier and Lin. It is known that the squared error-correction-radii of ROBDAs can be computed from the minimal squared Euclidean distances (MSEDs) between the all-one sequence and the polyhedra corresponding to the error patterns. For the computation of such MSEDs, we give a new method which is more compact than the one proposed by Fossorier and Lin. These results are further used to show that any bounded-distance ROBDA is asymptotically optimal: The ratio between the probability of decoding error of a bounded-distance ROBDA and that of the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding approaches 1 when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approaches infinity, provided that the minimum Hamming distance of the code is greater than 2.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2005.860451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/33205/01564450.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"336","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2005.860451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the reliability-order-based decoding algorithms for binary linear block codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"On the reliability-order-based decoding algorithms for binary linear block codes","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1564450/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8710609","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the reliability-order-based decoding algorithms for binary linear block codes","sourcePdf":"01564450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053948S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"33205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33205","articleId":"1564450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1564512,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Medical experts sometimes listen to heart sounds through auscultation system, either from stethoscope or PCG (phonocardiogram), as one of the ways in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The auscultation process is subjective and largely depends on the experience, skill, knowledge or hearing ability of the physician to interpret heart conditions. This paper examines heart valve-related diseases using a multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The heart sounds were digitally filtered with moving average filter, segmented with sliding window and then reduced to an arbitrary frame of 64 points. After that, it is pre-processed by fast Fourier transform prior to feeding into the neural network for classification. To check for network robustness, the heart sound samples were injected with different level of noise. A total of 55 types of sample data were generated and used for classification. The study produces a 100% correct classification of eleven heart-valve diseases.","doi":"10.1109/ASENSE.2005.1564512","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","publicationTitle":"2005 Asian Conference on Sensors and the International Conference on New Techniques in Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Research","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASENSE.2005.1564512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33208","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asian Conference on Sensors and the International Conference on New Techniques in Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Research","pdfPath":"/iel5/10462/33208/01564512.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of heart sounds using a multilayer feed-forward neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1564512/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of heart sounds using a multilayer feed-forward neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1564512/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8672043","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of heart sounds using a multilayer feed-forward neural network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"01564512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043291S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10462","isNumber":"33208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10462","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33208","articleId":"1564512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1564523,"authors":[{"name":"S.F.B.

In this scheme, the AA is employed to generate the initial candidate vectors for the MCM interconnect test generation, where the pheromone updating rule and state transition rule of AA is designed. Then the GA evolves the candidate vectors generated by AA, using a fault simulator to evaluate the fitness of each candidate vector.

Chief among them is a debugger that enables runtime binary analysis at an instruction level. One of the important services provided by a debugger is the ability to stop execution of code at an arbitrary point during runtime, using breakpoints. Software breakpoints support an unlimited number of breakpoint locations by changing the code being debugged so that it can be interrupted during runtime. Most, if not all, malware are very sensitive to code modification with self-modifying and/or self-checking (SM-SC) capabilities, rendering the use of software breakpoints limited in their scope. Hardware breakpoints supported by the underlying processor, on the other hand, use a subset of the processor register set and exception mechanisms to provide breakpoints that do not entail code modification. This makes hardware breakpoints the most powerful breakpoint mechanism for malware analysis. However, current processors provide a very limited number of hardware breakpoints (typically 2-4 locations). Thus, a serious restriction is imposed on the debugger to set a desired number of breakpoints without resorting to the limited alternative of software breakpoints. Also, with the ever evolving nature of malware, there are techniques being employed that prevent the use of hardware breakpoints. This calls for a new breakpoint mechanism that retains the features of hardware breakpoints while providing an unlimited number of breakpoints, which cannot be detected or countered. In this paper, we present the concept of stealth breakpoints and discuss the design and implementation of VAMPiRE, a realization of this concept. VAMPiRE cannot be detected or countered and provides unlimited number of breakpoints to be set on code, data, and I/O with the same precision as that of hardware breakpoints. It does so by employing a subtle combination of simple stealth techniques using virtual memory and hardware single-stepping mechanisms that are available on all processors, old and new. This technique makes VAMPiRE portable to any architecture, providing powerful breakpoint ability similar to hardware breakpoints for microscopic malware analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8970244","htmlLink":"/document/1565265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stealth breakpoints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stealth breakpoints","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"01565265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075243S","chronDate":"5-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10467","isNumber":"33214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10467","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33214","articleId":"1565265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1565275,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Nonlinear (kernel) versions of these spectral matched (subspace) detectors are also discussed and their performance is compared with the linear versions. These kernel-based detectors exploit the nonlinear correlations between the spectral bands that are ignored by the conventional detectors. Several well-known matched detectors, such as matched subspace detector, orthogonal subspace detector, spectral matched filter and adaptive subspace detector (adaptive cosine estimator) are extended to their corresponding kernel versions by using the idea of kernel-based learning theory. In kernel-based detection algorithms the data is implicitly mapped into a high dimensional kernel feature space by a nonlinear mapping which is associated with a kernel function. The detection algorithm is then derived in the feature space which is kernelized in terms of the kernel functions in order to avoid explicit computation in the high dimensional feature space. Experimental results based on simulated toyexamples and real hyperspectral imagery show that the kernel versions of these detectors outperform the conventional linear detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1565301/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Kernel Matched Signal Detectors for Hyperspectral Target Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel Matched Signal Detectors for Hyperspectral Target Detection","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095836S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565302,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Typically, the effectiveness of a new algorithm is demonstrated only by the presentation of a few segmented images and is otherwise left to subjective evaluation by the reader. Little effort has been spent on the design of perceptually correct measures to compare an automatic segmentation of an image to a set of hand-segmented examples of the same image. This paper demonstrates how a modification of the Rand index, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand (NPR) index, meets the requirements of largescale performance evaluation of image segmentation. We show that the measure has a clear probabilistic interpretation as the maximum likelihood estimator of an underlying Gibbs model, can be correctly normalized to account for the inherent similarity in a set of ground truth images, and can be computed efficiently for large datasets. Results are presented on images from the publicly available Berkeley Segmentation dataset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565332.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Measure for Objective Evaluation of Image Segmentation Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Humans","Robots","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Machine vision","Target tracking","Shape","Clustering algorithms","Image databases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Measure for Objective Evaluation of Image Segmentation Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565332/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Measure for Objective Evaluation of Image Segmentation Algorithms","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045255S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565351,"authors":[{"name":"Tai-Peng Tian","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Tai-Peng Tian","id":"37087541745"},{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Rui Li","id":"37089049353"},{"name":"S.

Given a differentiable function that maps from pose space to image feature space, the goal is to invert the process: estimate the pose given only image features. The inversion is an ill-posed problem as the inverse mapping is a one to many process, hence multiple solutions exist. It is desirable to restrict the solution space to a smaller subset of feasible solutions. The space of feasible solutions may not admit a closed form description. The proposed framework seeks to learn an approximation over such a space. Using Gaussian Process Latent Variable Modelling. The scaled conjugate gradient method is used to find the best matching pose in the learned space. The formulation allows easy incorporation of various constraints for more accurate pose estimation. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in the task of upper-body pose estimation from silhouettes and compared with the Specialized Mapping Architecture. The proposed approach performs better than the latter approach in terms of estimation accuracy with synthetic data and qualitatively better results with real video of humans performing gestures.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.414","startPage":"50","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565351.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Articulated Pose Estimation in a Learned Smooth Space of Feasible Solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Articulated Pose Estimation in a Learned Smooth Space of Feasible Solutions","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565351/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565351/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Articulated Pose Estimation in a Learned Smooth Space of Feasible Solutions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078842S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1565363,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Optical flow, with the abundant motion information present in image sequences, has been studied extensively for vehicle detection. However, using dense optical ?ow for vehicle detection is sensitive to shocks and vibrations of the mobile camera; image outliers caused by illumination changes; and high computational complexity. To improve vehicle detection performance and reduce computational complexity, we propose an efficient and robust methodology for overtaking vehicle detection based on homogeneous sparse optical flow and eigenspace modeling. Specifically, our method models the background into dynamic and quasi-static regions. Instead of using dense optical flow to model the dynamic parts of the background, we employ homogeneous sparse optical flow, which makes detection more robust to camera shocks and vibrations. Moreover, to make detection robust to illumination changes, we employ a blockbased eigenspace approach to represent quasi-static regions in the background. A region-based hysteresis-thresholding approach, augmented by a localized spatial segmentation procedure, attains a good tradeoff between true detections and false positives. The proposed methodology has been evaluated using challenging traf?c scenes illustrating good performance.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.506","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565368.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overtaking Vehicle Detection Using Dynamic and Quasi-Static Background Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565368/","displayDocTitle":"Overtaking Vehicle Detection Using Dynamic and Quasi-Static Background Modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565368/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overtaking Vehicle Detection Using Dynamic and Quasi-Static Background Modeling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067085S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1565369,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While working toward that goal, we do not attempt to recognize prototypic facial expressions of emotions but analyze subtle changes in facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle action units (AUs, i.e., atomic facial signals) instead. By detecting AUs we can analyse many more facial communicative signals than emotional expressions alone. This paper proposes AU detection by classifying features calculated from tracked ?ducial facial points. We use a Particle Filtering tracking scheme using factorized likelihoods and a novel observation model that combines a rigid and a morphologic model. The AUs displayed in a video are classi?ed using Probabilistic Actively Learned Support VectorMachines (PAL-SVM).When tested on 167 videos from the MMI web-based facial expression database, the proposed method achieved very high recognition rates for 16 different AUs. To ascertain data independency we also performed a validation using another benchmark database. When trained on the MMI-Facial expression database and tested on the Cohn-Kanade database, the proposed method achieved a recognition rate of 84% when detecting 9 AUs occurring alone or in combination in input image sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Support vector machines","Face recognition","Image databases","Emotion recognition","Signal analysis","Testing","Robustness","Behavioral science","Biomedical imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.457","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565383.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Action Unit Detection using Probabilistic Actively Learned Support Vector Machines on Tracked Facial Point Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Facial Action Unit Detection using Probabilistic Actively Learned Support Vector Machines on Tracked Facial Point Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565383/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565383/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial Action Unit Detection using Probabilistic Actively Learned Support Vector Machines on Tracked Facial Point Data","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087477S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1565408,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Various projects have explored the possibilities of steerable projectors but they have not addressed the calibration of a generalized optical and mechanical system. We present a method for calibrating a device comprised of a projector and a pan-tilt mirror. It starts by obtaining the internal parameters of a camera and the projector, then the pan-tilt mirror is placed in a series of positions and for each one the reflected projector position is calculated from a pattern projected onto a planar surface. From those readings a coarse version of the steerable projector parameters is obtained, which is then iteratively refined. We describe real results from our physical setup and a range of results from simulated data to characterize the performance of our algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steerable Projector Calibration","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.533","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565408.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Steerable Projector Calibration","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565408/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steerable Projector Calibration","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066174S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1565426,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we propose to use a generic model to label the 3D facial features. This approach relies on our realistic face modeling technique, by which the individual face model is created using a generic model and two views of a face. In the individualized model, we label the face features by their maximum and minimum curvatures. Among the labeled features, the \"good features\" are selected by using a Genetic Algorithm based approach. The feature space is then formed by using these new 3D shape descriptors, and each individual face is classified according to its feature space correlation. We applied 72 individual models for the test. The experimental results show that the shape information obtained from the 3D individualized model can be used to classify and identify individual facial surfaces. The rank-four correct recognition rate is about 92%. The 3D individualized model provides consistent and sufficient details to represent individual faces while using a much more simpli?ed representation than the range data models. This work provides the possibility to reduce the complexity of 3D data processing, and is feasible for real applications such as in a non-cooperative imaging circumstance or in the situation when range data using 3D scanners are not possible to acquire.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.378","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565429.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Two Views Face Modeling and Labeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565429/","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Two Views Face Modeling and Labeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565429/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition Using Two Views Face Modeling and Labeling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086562S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1565430,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Depth information of a 3D face can be used to solve the problems of illumination and pose variation associated with face recognition. Registration is an integral part of any reconstruction process and hence we focus on the problem of automatic registration of 3D face point sets through a criterion based on Gaussian fields. The method defines a simple energy function, which is always differentiable and convex in a large neighborhood of the alignment parameters; allowing for the use of powerful standard optimization techniques. The new method overcomes the necessity of close initialization, which is required by Iterative Closest Point algorithm. Moreover, the use of the Fast Gauss Transform reduces the computational complexity of the registration algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.392","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565431.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Automatic 3D Face Registration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565431/","displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Automatic 3D Face Registration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565431/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Automatic 3D Face Registration","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.196502S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565445,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

We demonstrate this methodology through an algorithm for gesture recognition that has been developed previously in software [9]. Using the recently introduced modeling technique of homogeneous parameterized dataflow (HPDF) [3], which effectively captures the structure of an important class of computer vision applications, we systematically transform the gesture recognition application into a streamlined HDL implementation, which is based on Verilog and VHDL. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach we synthesize the HDL implementation on the Xilinx Virtex II FPGA. This paper describes our design methodology based on the HPDF representation, which offers useful properties in terms of verifying correctness and exposing performance- enhancing transformations; discusses various challenges that we addressed in efficiently linking the HPDFbased application representation to target-specific HDL code; and provides experimental results pertaining to the mapping of the gesture recognition application onto the Virtex II using our methodology.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.438","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565448.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Computer Vision on FPGAs: Design Methodology and its Application to Gesture Recognition","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1565448/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer Vision on FPGAs: Design Methodology and its Application to Gesture Recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107552S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1565450,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The system utilizes a low cost CMOS color camera module, a frame buffer chip and all image data is processed by a low cost microcontroller. The system includes the original functionality of color blob tracking, but improves upon it with tracking speeds of up to 50 frames per second. New functionality includes frame differencing, edge detection, and color histogramming.

Here, the concept is extended to assist in planning in-vivo experiments in general, using a new tool that we have developed called RNAMute. We apply the package RNAMute on an RNA transcript that was shown experimentally to inactivate spectinomycin resistance in Escherichia coli by creating a library of point mutations using PCR and screening to locate those mutations. Our prediction, conducted independently of the known experimental results, succeeds in matching the inactivating point mutations that were obtained by the selection experiment. Validation of the method with data available from laboratory experiment supports its use as a general predictive tool.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565457.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern Recognition Method to Detect Vulnerable Spots in an RNA Sequence for Bacterial Resistance to the Antibiotic Spectinomycin","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","RNA","Microorganisms","Immune system","Antibiotics","Genetic mutations","Switches","Packaging","Libraries","Laboratories"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Pattern Recognition Method to Detect Vulnerable Spots in an RNA Sequence for Bacterial Resistance to the Antibiotic Spectinomycin","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565457/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern Recognition Method to Detect Vulnerable Spots in an RNA Sequence for Bacterial Resistance to the Antibiotic Spectinomycin","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071443S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1565471,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Chunyan Xie","id":"37333675800"},{"name":"M.

We have tested the proposed CFA method and compared it with the PCA and LDA methods in a recognition scenario on the FRGC2.0 data.

Our experimental results are based on the largest 3D face dataset to date, with 449 persons, over 4,000 3D images, and substantial lapse between gallery and probe images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565475.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Rigid Multi-region Selection for Handling Expression Variation in 3D Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Shape","Iterative algorithms","Probes","Degradation","Biosensors","Layout","Databases","Computer science","Principal component analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Rigid Multi-region Selection for Handling Expression Variation in 3D Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Rigid Multi-region Selection for Handling Expression Variation in 3D Face Recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057914S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1565478,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Jung Seow","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence & Machine Vision Laboratory, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Jung Seow","id":"37563984600"},{"name":"R.C.

In this paper, we propose the concept of a manifold of facial perception based on the observation that a perceived face in a set of similar face images-subjected to variations in pose, illumination and expression-defines a manifold in the high dimensional space. Such a manifold representation can be learned from images in a database of similar facial feature characteristics. This learned manifold can then be used as a basis for facial recognition. Development of a mathematical model for a nonlinear line attractor that represents a pattern manifold in the feature space is presented in this paper. The non-convex pattern manifolds in the feature space may be extremely complex and difficult to model. Therefore an adaptive divide and conquer modular approach which divides complex manifolds into smaller sub-manifolds in the feature space is also proposed for accurate modeling of the nonlinear line of attraction. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique using the learned matrices of the nonlinear line attractor network is then used to embed a set of related observations into a low-dimensional space that preserves the intrinsic dimensionality and metric structure of the data for fast and accurate face recognition. Results based on the proposed work from the first experiment of the FRGC version 2 database have shown promising performance in improving the accuracy in the face recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Technique for Pose and Lighting Invariant Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.565","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565478.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A New Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Technique for Pose and Lighting Invariant Face Recognition","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565478/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Technique for Pose and Lighting Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054391S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565482,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and System Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Peng Wang","id":"37280432400"},{"name":"M.B.

The large number of faces in real world databases makes computationally intensive algorithms impractical for scanning entire databases. We propose the use of more efficient algorithms to \"prescreen\" face databases, determining a limited set of likely matches that can be processed further to identify a match. We use both radial symmetry and shape to extract five features of interest on 3D range images of faces. These facial features determine a very small subset of discriminating points which serve as input to a prescreening algorithm based on a Hausdorff fraction. We show how to compute the Haudorff fraction in linear O(n) time using a range image representation. Our feature extraction and prescreening algorithms are verified using the FRGC v1.0 3D face scan data. Results show 97% of the extracted facial features are within 10 mm or less of manually marked ground truth, and the prescreener has a rank 6 recognition rate of 100%.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.566","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565486.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Prescreener for 3D Face Recognition Using Radial Symmetry and the Hausdorff Fraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565486/","displayDocTitle":"A Prescreener for 3D Face Recognition Using Radial Symmetry and the Hausdorff Fraction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565486/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Prescreener for 3D Face Recognition Using Radial Symmetry and the Hausdorff Fraction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103061S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565487,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.

The standard 3D formulation of the Hausdorff matching algorithm has been modified to operate on a 2D range image, enabling a reduction in computation from O(N2) to O(N) without large storage requirements. The Hausdorff distance is known for its robustness to data outliers and inconsistent data between two data sets, making it a suitable choice for dealing with the inherent problems in many 3D datasets due to sensor noise and object self-occlusion. For optimal performance, the algorithm assumes a good initial alignment between probe and template datasets. However, to minimize the error between two faces, the alignment can be iteratively refined.

Firstly, we present an effective method to automatically extract ROI of facial surface, which mainly depends on automatic detection of facial bilateral symmetry plane and localization of nose tip. Then we build a reference plane through the nose tip for calculating the relative depth values. Considering the non-rigid property of facial surface, the ROI is triangulated and parameterized into an isomorphic 2D planar circle, attempting to preserve the intrinsic geometric properties. At the same time the relative depth values are also mapped. Finally we perform eigenface on the mapped relative depth image. The entire scheme is insensitive to pose variance. The experiment using FRGC database v1.0 obtains the rank-1 identification score of 95%, which outperforms the result of the PCA base-line method by 4%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2005.560","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05) - Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/10468/33215/01565493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33215","startPage":"175","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Mapped Depth Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Mapped Depth Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565493/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1565493/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition using Mapped Depth Images","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01565493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128451S","chronDate":"25-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10468","isNumber":"33215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10468","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33215","articleId":"1565493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1565559,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In typical data mining applications, the number of cells in such arrays is usually large. Our primary focus is detecting anomalies by comparing information at the current time to historical data. Naive approaches advocated in the process control literature do not work well in this scenario due to the multiple testing problems - performing multiple statistical tests on the same data produce excessive number of false positives. We use an empirical Bayes method which works by fitting a two component Gaussian mixture to deviations at current time. The approach is scalable to problems that involve monitoring massive number of cells and fast enough to be potentially useful in many streaming scenarios. We show the superiority of the method relative to a naive \"per component error rate\" procedure through simulation. A novel feature of our technique is the ability to suppress deviations that are merely the consequence of sharp changes in the marginal distributions. This research was motivated by the need to extract critical application information and business intelligence from the daily logs that accompany large-scale spoken dialog systems deployed by AT&T. We illustrate our method on one such system.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.22","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565658.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","startPage":"8 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical Bayes approach to detect anomalies in dynamic multidimensional arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An empirical Bayes approach to detect anomalies in dynamic multidimensional arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565658/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857322","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1565658/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical Bayes approach to detect anomalies in dynamic multidimensional arrays","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07829S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1565664,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shortest-path kernels on graphs","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.132","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565664.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Shortest-path kernels on graphs","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565664/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857328","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shortest-path kernels on graphs","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051608S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1565666,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

As a solution, we consider quite a general class of time series, and propose a regime based on two types of similarity that can exist between subsequence vectors, which give rise naturally to an alternative distance measure to Euclidean distance in the subsequence vector space.

They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.79","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","startPage":"8 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HOT SAX: efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HOT SAX: efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565683/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857347","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1565683/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HOT SAX: efficiently finding the most unusual time series subsequence","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047362S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"286","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1565685,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

A classifier learner is categorized as \"local\" if it is insensitive to this type of sample selection bias, otherwise, it is considered \"global\". In that paper, the true model is not clearly distinguished from the model that the algorithm outputs. In their discussion of Bayesian classifiers, logistic regression and hard-margin SVMs, the true model (or the model that generates the true class label for every example) is implicitly assumed to be contained in the model space of the learner, and the true class probabilities and model estimated class probabilities are assumed to asymptotically converge as the training data set size increases. However, in the discussion of naive Bayes, decision trees and soft-margin SVMs, the model space is assumed not to contain the true model, and these three algorithms are instead argued to be \"global learners\". We argue that most classifier learners may or may not be affected by sample selection bias; this depends on the dataset as well as the heuristics or inductive bias implied by the learning algorithm and their appropriateness to the particular dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.24","startPage":"4 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565737.pdf","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved categorization of classifier's sensitivity on sample selection bias","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An improved categorization of classifier's sensitivity on sample selection bias","conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565737/","accessionNumber":"8857401","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved categorization of classifier's sensitivity on sample selection bias","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043144S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1565751,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

A spatial scan statistic essentially considers a scan window, and identifies anomalous windows by moving the scan window in the region. While spatial scan statistic has been successful, earlier proposals suffer from two limitations: (i) They restrict the scan window to be of a regular shape (e.g., circle, rectangle, cylinder). However, the region of anomaly, in general, is not necessarily of a regular shape. (ii) They take into account autocorrelation among spatial data, but not spatial heterogeneity. As a result, they often result in inaccurate anomalous windows. To address these limitations, we propose a random walk based free-form spatial scan statistic (FS/sup 3/). Application of FS/sup 3/ on real datasets has shown that it can identify more refined anomalous windows with better likelihood ratio of it being an anomaly, than those identified by earlier spatial scan statistic approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.71","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","startPage":"4 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FS/sup 3/: a random walk based free-form spatial scan statistic for anomalous window detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FS/sup 3/: a random walk based free-form spatial scan statistic for anomalous window detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565751/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857415","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1565751/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FS/sup 3/: a random walk based free-form spatial scan statistic for anomalous window detection","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050304S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1565783,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Ho Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chi-Ho Tsang","id":"37551148700"},{"name":"Sam Kwong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Sam Kwong","id":"37266290800"},{"name":"Hanli Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Hanli Wang","id":"37292564900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2278-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"1565783","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Genetics","Fuzzy systems","Evolutionary computation","Fuzzy sets","Data mining","Biological cells","Distribution strategy","Gaussian processes","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","genetic algorithms","fuzzy systems","multi-agent systems","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly intrusion detection","multiobjective genetic fuzzy system","agent-based evolutionary computation","fuzzy rule-based knowledge"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly intrusion detection using multi-objective genetic fuzzy system and agent-based evolutionary computation framework","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2005.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33217","publicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10470/33217/01565783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2005.26","startPage":"4 pp.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1565783","abstract":"In this paper, we present a multi-objective genetic fuzzy system for anomaly intrusion detection.

Most of its applications typically possess high dimensional datasets. In high dimensional space, the data becomes sparse which implies that every object can be regarded as an outlier from the point of view of similarity. Furthermore, a fundamental issue is that the notion of which objects are outliers typically varies between users, problem domains or, even, datasets. In this paper, we present a novel robust solution which detects high dimensional outliers based on user examples and tolerates incorrect inputs. It studies the behavior of projections of such a few examples, to discover further objects that are outstanding in the projection where many examples are outlying. Our experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to detect outliers corresponding to the user examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1565793/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857457","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Example-based robust outlier detection in high dimensional datasets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example-based robust outlier detection in high dimensional datasets","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01565793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049236S","chronDate":"27-30 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10470","isNumber":"33217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10470","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33217","articleId":"1565793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1565809,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The framework provides a robust solution for soccer goal event detection by combining the strength of multimodal analysis and the ability of neural network ensembles to reduce the generalization error. Due to the rareness of the goal events, the bootstrapped sampling method on the training set is utilized to enhance the recall of goal event detection. Then a group of component networks are trained using all the available training data. The precision of the detection is greatly improved via the following two steps. First, a pre-filtering step is employed on the test set to reduce the noisy and inconsistent data, and then an advanced weighting scheme is proposed to intelligently traverse and combine the component network predictions by taking into consideration the prediction performance of each network. A set of experiments are designed to compare the performance of different bootstrapped sampling schemes, to present the strength of the proposed weighting scheme in event detection, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for soccer goal event detection.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2005.83","startPage":"8 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10471/33218/01565809.pdf","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2005.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based framework for goal event detection in soccer videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Event detection","Intelligent networks","Videos","Hidden Markov models","Robustness","Sampling methods","Feature extraction","Multimedia systems","Multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","neural nets","object detection","sport","filtering theory","sampling methods","modal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","soccer video","semantic event detection","soccer goal event detection","multimodal analysis","bootstrapped sampling","component network","prefiltering step","prediction performance","weighting scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1565809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based framework for goal event detection in soccer videos","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1565809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"14-14 Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8893924","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based framework for goal event detection in soccer videos","confLoc":"Irvine, CA","sourcePdf":"01565809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091995S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10471","isNumber":"33218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10471","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33218","articleId":"1565809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE/CSP","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1565871,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One problem is that the amount of traffic data does not allow real-time analysis of details. Another problem is that the specific characteristics of these events are not known in advance. There is a need for analysis methods that are real-time capable and can handle large amounts of traffic data. We have developed an entropy-based approach that determines and reports entropy contents of traffic parameters such as IP addresses. Changes in the entropy content indicate a massive network event. We give analyses on two Internet worms as proof-of-concept. While our primary focus is detection of fast worms, our approach should also be able to detect other network events. We discuss implementation alternatives and give benchmark results. We also show that our approach scales very well.","displayPublicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise (WETICE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10476/33223/01566205.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"14th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise (WETICE'05)","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2005.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2005.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy based worm and anomaly detection in fast IP networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Intelligent networks","IP networks","Telecommunication traffic","Event detection","Internet","Spine","Data compression","Communication system traffic","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","IP networks","telecommunication traffic","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","IP networks","worm outbreaks","real time analysis","entropy contents","traffic parameters","IP addresses","massive network event","Internet worms","fast worm detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Entropy based worm and anomaly detection in fast IP networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566205/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8723816","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy based worm and anomaly detection in fast IP networks","confLoc":"Link&#xF6;ping, Sweden","sourcePdf":"01566205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046131S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10476","isNumber":"33223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10476","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"33223","articleId":"1566205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566313,"authors":[{"name":"E.U.

Meetings typically take place in rooms with non-ideal acoustic conditions and significant background noise, and may contain large sections of overlapping speech. In such circumstances, headset microphones have to date provided the best recognition performance, however participants are often reluctant to wear them. Microphone arrays provide an alternative to close-talking microphones by providing speech enhancement through directional discrimination. Unfortunately, however, development of array front-end systems for state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition suffers from a lack of necessary resources, as most available speech corpora consist only of single-channel recordings. This paper describes the collection of an audio-visual corpus of read speech from a number of instrumented meeting rooms. The corpus, based on the WSJCAM0 database, is suitable for use in continuous speech recognition experiments and is captured using a variety of microphones, including arrays, as well as close-up and wider angle cameras.

Recognition is performed either by modifying the recognizer to work from incomplete spectra, or by estimating the missing components to reconstruct complete spectra. While the former approach performs optimal classification with incomplete spectrograms, the latter permits recognition with cepstral features derived from reconstructed spectra. Traditionally, spectral components are considered unequivocally reliable or unreliable. Research has shown that the use of soft masks that provide a probability of reliability to spectral components instead can improve the performance of missing feature methods that modify the recognizer. However, soft masks have not been employed by methods that reconstruct the spectrogram. In this paper we present a new MMSE algorithm for spectrogram reconstruction.

Our method uses a network of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to predict system and user intentions, where a \"language model\" predicts sequences of goals and the component HMMs predict sequences of intentions.

Sub-word lexicon units may be utilized to dramatically reduce the out-of-vocabulary rate in test data. One can develop language models based on sub-word units to perform LVCSR. However, it has not always been beneficial to use sub-word lexicon units, since shorter units have higher acoustic confusability among them and language model history is effectively shorter as compared to the history in full-word language models. To reduce the aforementioned problems, we propose using the longest possible sub-word units in our lexicon, namely half-words and full-words only. We also incorporate linguistic rules of half-word combination into our statistical language model. The language constraints are represented with a rule-based WFSM which can be combined with an N-gram language model to yield a better and smaller language model. We study the performance of the proposed system for Turkish LVCSR, when the language constraint takes the form of enforcing vowel harmony between stems and endings. We also introduce novel error-rate metrics that are more appropriate than word-error-rate for agglutinative languages. Using half-words with a bi-gram model yields a significant reduction in word-error-rate as compared to a bi-gram full-word model. In addition, combining a tri-gram half-word language model with the vowel-harmony WFSM improves the accuracy further when rescoring the bi-gram lattices","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10480/33227/01566516.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating language constraints in sub-word based speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566516/","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating language constraints in sub-word based speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9053375","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566516/","conferenceDate":"27 Nov.-1 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating language constraints in sub-word based speech recognition","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01566516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056179S","chronDate":"27-27 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10480","isNumber":"33227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10480","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33227","articleId":"1566516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1566518,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

Major challenges in surface electromyography based speech recognition ensue from repositioning electrodes between recording sessions, environmental temperature changes, and skin tissue properties of the speaker. In order to reduce the impact of these factors, we investigate a variety of signal normalization and model adaptation methods. An average word accuracy of 97.3% is achieved using seven EMG channels and the same electrode positions. The performance drops to 76.2% after repositioning the electrodes if no normalization or adaptation is performed. By applying our adaptation methods we manage to restore the recognition rates to 87.1%. Furthermore, we compare audibly to non-audibly spoken speech.

First, we mathematically analyze the definition of margin and introduce some theoretically-sound constraints into the minimax optimization to guarantee the boundedness of the margin in LME. Moreover, we propose to solve this constrained minimax optimization problem by using a penalized gradient descent algorithm, where the original objective function, i.e., minimum margin, is approximated by a differentiable function and the new constraints are cast as penalty terms in the objective function. The new method is evaluated in a speaker-independent E-set speech recognition task by using the OGI ISOLET database. Experimental results show that the new constraints are very effective to ensure the convergence of the minimax optimization and the large margin estimation via the resultant optimization method can achieve significant word error rate (WER) reduction over the conventional HMM training methods, such as MLE and MCE","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10480/33227/01566525.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constrained joint optimization method for large margin HMM estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566525/","displayDocTitle":"A constrained joint optimization method for large margin HMM estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9053383","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566525/","conferenceDate":"27 Nov.-1 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constrained joint optimization method for large margin HMM estimation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01566525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061202S","chronDate":"27-27 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10480","isNumber":"33227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10480","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33227","articleId":"1566525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1566529,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is therefore imperative to have good tools for exploring a wide range of design choices, especially during the early design stages, where the design space is at its largest. This paper presents an overview of the Sesame framework, which provides high-level modeling and simulation methods and tools for system-level performance evaluation and exploration of heterogeneous embedded systems. More specifically, we describe Sesame's modeling methodology and trajectory. It takes a designer systematically along the path from selecting candidate architectures, using analytical modeling and multiobjective optimization, to simulating these candidate architectures with our system-level simulation environment. This simulation environment subsequently allows for architectural exploration at different levels of abstraction while maintaining high-level and architecture-independent application specifications. We illustrate all these aspects using a case study in which we traverse Sesame's exploration trajectory for a motion-JPEG encoder application.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.16","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/33229/01566572.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systematic approach to exploring embedded system architectures at multiple abstraction levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566572/","displayDocTitle":"A systematic approach to exploring embedded system architectures at multiple abstraction levels","volume":"55","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566572/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8781315","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic approach to exploring embedded system architectures at multiple abstraction levels","sourcePdf":"01566572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093431S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"33229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"33229","articleId":"1566572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566574,"authors":[{"name":"Moo-Kyoung Chung","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Laboratory, CHiPS, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Moo-Kyoung Chung","id":"37277215500"},{"name":"Chong-Min Kyung","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Laboratory, CHiPS, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chong-Min Kyung","id":"37277218400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"1566574","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":188},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip","hardware-software codesign"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level simulation","system-on-chip design","dynamic transaction prediction","simulator scheduling algorithm","HW-SW cosimulation","HW-SW coemulation","system-level verification","heterogeneous simulation environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- Simulation performance","system-level verification","cosimulation","coemulation","heterogeneous simulation environment."]}],"abstract":"For system-level simulation of a complex system-on-chip design, multiple hardware simulators and emulators can be combined to work together. The simulation performance in this case is often limited by the communication overhead between simulators and emulators. To reduce the amount of communication in this heterogeneous simulation environment, we propose novel methods to find a time interval during which there are no transactions among simulators based on a dynamic prediction of transaction occurrence time for both software and hardware models. We also propose a simulator scheduling algorithm which allows the simulator to work alone without interaction with others when there is no transaction. By so doing, we reduced the amount of pure communication by a factor of 15 to 67 and, as a result, achieved a speed-up factor of 4 to 40 compared to existing lock-step simulation, as shown by experimental results with various application examples.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.24","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/33229/01566574.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing performance of HW/SW cosimulation and coemulation by reducing communication overhead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566574/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing performance of HW/SW cosimulation and coemulation by reducing communication overhead","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8796013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566574/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing performance of HW/SW cosimulation and coemulation by reducing communication overhead","sourcePdf":"01566574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034613S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","isNumber":"33229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1566574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1566578,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.T.

Current debug support solutions are platform specific and incompatible with processors and active peripherals from other sources, restricting effective design reuse. In order to overcome this reuse challenge, this paper defines interfaces to decouple the debug support from processor cores and other active data accessing units. The on-chip debug support infrastructure is also decoupled from each core's debug support and from the trace port or trace memory, using an additional interface. As a result, this decoupling of the debug support infrastructure provides freedom from a specific SoC platform. These interfaces are applied through a reference design modeled using VHDL that is based on a novel low overhead trace message framework. Compared with a leading implementation of a relevant standard, the reference design is 50 percent more compact while providing improvements in trace compression of 8.4 percent for program trace messages and almost 24 percent for data trace messages. This reference design is a multiple core solution that is compatible with most SoC architectures, including those based on emerging network-on-chip architectures.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/33229/01566578.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Debug support strategy for systems-on-chips with multiple processor cores","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware design languages","Computer architecture","Multiprocessing","Logic circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip","hardware description languages","computer architecture","multiprocessing systems","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data tracing","system level development","system-on-chip","debug support solution","VHDL","network-on-chip architecture","multiple processor core","system architecture","embedded system","multiprocessor system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index Terms- System architectures","integration","and modeling","real-time and embedded systems","multiprocessor systems","debugging aids."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Debug support strategy for systems-on-chips with multiple processor cores","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1566578/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8781319","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Debug support strategy for systems-on-chips with multiple processor cores","sourcePdf":"01566578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077214S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"33229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"33229","articleId":"1566578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566590,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In order to design efficient scheduling algorithms for such workloads, it is required to have a good in-depth knowledge of basic random scheduling strategies. This paper analyzes the distribution of sequential jobs and the system behavior in heterogeneous computational grid environments where the brokering is done in such a way that each computing element has a probability to be chosen proportional to its number of CPUs and (new from the previous paper) its relative speed. We provide the asymptotic behavior for several metrics (queue-sizes, slowdowns, etc.) or, in some cases, an approximation of this behavior. We study these metrics for a variety of workload configurations (load, distribution, etc.). We compare our probabilistic analysis to simulations in order to validate our results. These results provide a good understanding of the system behavior for each metric proposed. This enables us to design advanced and efficient algorithms for more complex cases.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2006.27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/33230/01566590.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2006.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33230","startPage":"113","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the distribution of sequential jobs in random brokering for heterogeneous computational grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the distribution of sequential jobs in random brokering for heterogeneous computational grids","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8785672","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1566590/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the distribution of sequential jobs in random brokering for heterogeneous computational grids","sourcePdf":"01566590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089241S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"33230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"33230","articleId":"1566590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1566594,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

Then we look at various aspects of the system performance. The next section deals with mobile reception. Network planning issues, antenna diversity concepts for mobile receivers, and handover procedures will be considered. Finally, the introduction of DVB-T in Germany is presented as a case study. In contrast to various other countries Germany decided to offer DVB-T as a means of providing the \"anywhere TV\" experience. This implies that DVB-T signals can be received with mobile and portable receivers.

The system is structured as a toolkit to allow the implementation of the following satellite applications: TV and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. It has been specified around three concepts: best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, total flexibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. Channel coding and modulation are based on more recent developments by the scientific community: low density parity check codes are adopted, combined with QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, and 32APSK modulations for the system to work properly on the nonlinear satellite channel. The framing structure allows for maximum flexibility in a versatile system and also synchronization in worst case configurations (low signal-to-noise ratios). Adaptive coding and modulation, when used in one-to-one links, then allows optimization of the transmission parameters for each individual user,dependant on path conditions. Backward-compatible modes are also available,allowing existing DVB-S integrated receivers-decoders to continue working during the transitional period. The paper provides a tutorial overview of the DVB-S2 system, describing its main features and performance in various scenarios and applications.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2005.861013","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/33232/01566630.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2005.861013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DVB-S2: The Second Generation Standard for Satellite Broad-Band Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566630","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"DVB-S2: The Second Generation Standard for Satellite Broad-Band Services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566630/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8731158","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566630/","volume":"94","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DVB-S2: The Second Generation Standard for Satellite Broad-Band Services","sourcePdf":"01566630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060629S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"33232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"33232","articleId":"1566630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1566634,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is undesirable as it complicates the design of the input and output filters. To reduce switching frequency deviation in the events of line and load variations, an adaptive feedforward control scheme that varies the hysteresis band according to the change of line input voltage and an adaptive feedback control scheme that varies the control parameter (i.e., sliding coefficient) according to the change of the output load are proposed. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. In addition, methods of implementing the proposed adaptive control strategies are discussed. Experimental results confirm that the adaptive control schemes are capable of reducing the switching frequency variations caused by both line and load variations.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.861191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33234","startPage":"182","endPage":"192","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/33234/01566704.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.861191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive feedforward and feedback control schemes for sliding mode controlled power converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Feedback control","Sliding mode control","Switching frequency","Load management","Voltage control","DC-DC power converters","Steady-state","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure systems","adaptive control","feedback","DC-DC power convertors","switching convertors","power filters","feedforward"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive feedforward control schemes","feedback control schemes","sliding mode controlled power converters","DC-DC converters","steady-state switching frequency","filter design","switching frequency deviation reduction","hysteresis band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive feedback control","adaptive feedforward control","buck converter","hysteresis modulation","pulse-width-modulation (PWM)","sliding mode (SM)control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive feedforward and feedback control schemes for sliding mode controlled power converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1566704/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8936389","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive feedforward and feedback control schemes for sliding mode controlled power converters","sourcePdf":"01566704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065947S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"33234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"33234","articleId":"1566704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1566705,"authors":[{"name":"Keliang Zhou","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/33234/1566705/1566705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keliang Zhou (M'04) received the B.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1992, the M.Eng. degree from Wuhan University of Transportation, Wuhan, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2002.","His research interests mainly involve power electronics and electric machines drives, advanced control and its applications.

Some remarkable theoretical advantages would be obtained if these kinds of lamps were driven with high frequency (HF) electronic ballasts. Nevertheless, at these frequencies, acoustic resonances (AR) phenomenon appears. Low wattage metal halide (MH) lamps are, among all HID lamps, the most affected by this phenomenon. To obtain lack of AR in HID lamps, lamp power frequency harmonics must have a lower amplitude than a certain threshold value, related to activation energy. An electronic ballast may be designed to guarantee power harmonics levels lower than this threshold level at nominal operation. Nevertheless, the equivalent resistance of HID lamps varies highly in starting and warm-up stages, as well as in the aging process. Therefore, the system must be designed to be adequate for the necessary \"supplying conditions\" for these load variations. In this paper, a new control strategy for a HF square-wave inverter is presented. This ballast keeps lamp power harmonics at low levels, regardless of the lamp equivalent load. The proposed ballast, along with the control strategy, is presented, as well as the built prototypes and experimental results carried out. From these experiments, it can be concluded that the proposed method supplies low wattage MH lamps with lack of acoustic resonances.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.861178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/33234/01566711.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"253","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.861178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New control strategy in a square-wave inverter for low wattage metal halide lamp supply to avoid acoustic resonances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"New control strategy in a square-wave inverter for low wattage metal halide lamp supply to avoid acoustic resonances","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1566711/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8936396","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New control strategy in a square-wave inverter for low wattage metal halide lamp supply to avoid acoustic resonances","sourcePdf":"01566711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070612S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"33234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33234","articleId":"1566711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1566712,"authors":[{"name":"R.-L.

Compared with the conventional PLL control of the electronic ballasts for cold cathode fluorescent lamps, the proposed PLL control scheme, by sensing the phase signals at the both ends of the resonant inductor, is able to have resonant frequency tracked for the electronic ballasts, where the equivalent resistance of the fluorescent lamps is even equal to hundreds of ohms or lower at steady-state. By employing the current regulator circuit, the proposed PLL controller regulates the values of the lamp's current by adjusting the operating frequency from the resonant frequency as a reference frequency point, the lamp's current is accurately controlled. The analysis of the proposed PLL control scheme will be presented in this paper.

Complex controllers (e.g., multiple rotating dq-frames or resonant-based) are often required to compensate low frequency grid voltage background distortion and an LCL-filter is usually adopted for the high frequency one. The possible wide range of grid impedance values (distributed generation is suited for remote areas with radial distribution plants) challenge the stability and the effectiveness of the LCL-filter-based current controlled system. It has been found out and it will be demonstrated in this paper that the use of active damping helps to stabilise the system in respect to many different kinds of resonances. The use of active damping results in an easy plug-in feature of the generation system in a vast range of grid conditions and in a more flexible operation of the overall system able to manage sudden grid changes. In the paper, a vast measurement campaign made on a single-phase system and on a three-phase system used as scale prototypes for photovoltaic and wind turbines, respectively, validate the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.861185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/33234/01566713.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.861185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of photovoltaic and wind turbine grid-connected inverters for a large set of grid impedance values","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566713/","displayDocTitle":"Stability of photovoltaic and wind turbine grid-connected inverters for a large set of grid impedance values","volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8936398","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566713/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of photovoltaic and wind turbine grid-connected inverters for a large set of grid impedance values","sourcePdf":"01566713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087716S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"33234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"753","xplore-issue":"33234","articleId":"1566713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1566714,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The inverter generates a pulsewidth modulated (PWM) voltage, with dv/dt values of about 6 kV//spl mu/s or even more. In three-leg inverters for three-phase applications the occurrence of common-mode voltage is inherent due to asymmetrical output pulses. As a result, for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) reasons, in most applications shielded cables are used between the inverter and the motor, implying high installation costs. The present paper discusses the use of cheaper, unshielded cables from an EMC point-of-view. A new method for measuring electromagnetic interference (EMI) from unshielded cables is proposed and measurement results are presented. The level of EMI is evaluated in different situations: without an output filter, with a classical LC output filter and with an advanced output filter with dc link feedback. It is concluded that, from an EMC point of view, unshielded cables can give very good performance provided that a common-mode (CM) output filter is used.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.861182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.861182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33234","startPage":"273","endPage":"281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/33234/01566714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566714","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic compatibility","AC motors","Cables","Variable speed drives","Pulse width modulation inverters","Filters","Voltage","Electromagnetic interference","Pulse inverters","Electromagnetic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic interference","cable shielding","variable speed drives","induction motors","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMC evaluation","unshielded motor cables","AC adjustable speed drive applications","induction motors","voltage-source inverters","PWM voltage","pulse width modulation","three-leg inverters","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic interference","EMI measurement","DC link feedback","common-mode output filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adjustable speed drives (ASD)","common-mode (CM) output filter","electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)","induction motors (IM)","pulsewidth modulated (PWM)","voltage-source inverters (VSI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An EMC evaluation of the use of unshielded motor cables in AC adjustable speed drive applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8936399","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1566714/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 January 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566714/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EMC evaluation of the use of unshielded motor cables in AC adjustable speed drive applications","sourcePdf":"01566714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054623S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"33234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33234","articleId":"1566714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":1566722,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.N.

An implementation of the system is proposed based on a fast tunable optical filter (TOF) in each encoder and decoder. This technique actively modulates the central wavelength of a TOF according to a functional code at the transmitter during the bit period before the transmission of the data. The system is modeled and analyzed taking into account multiple access interference (MAI), thermal noise, and phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN). The performance of this system is compared to that of a spectral amplitude coding system that uses either a Hadamard code or a modified quadratic congruence (MQC) code. The results show that the proposed DOCDMA system reduces the PIIN effect on the performance of the system and improves the bit error rate (BER) performance at a large number of users. Furthermore, it is found that when the effective power is large enough, the MAI becomes the main factor that limits system performance, whereas when the effective power is relatively low, both thermal noise and PIIN become the main limiting factors with thermal noise having the main influence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of a dynamic code division multiple access communication system based on tunable optical filter","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.858232","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33235/01566722.pdf","startPage":"3959","endPage":"3965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.858232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of a dynamic code division multiple access communication system based on tunable optical filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1566722/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8941449","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of a dynamic code division multiple access communication system based on tunable optical filter","sourcePdf":"01566722.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101235S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33235","articleId":"1566722","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566723,"authors":[{"name":"Cheing-Hong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/33235/1566723/1566723-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheing-Hong Lin was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1975.

The focus of this paper is on slow-light delay lines in which the group velocity is reduced using linear processes, including electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), population oscillations (POs), and microresonator-based photonic-crystal (PC) filters. We also consider slow-light delay lines in which the group velocity is reduced by an adiabatic process of bandwidth compression. A framework is developed for comparing these techniques and identifying fundamental physical limitations of linear slow-light technologies. It is shown that slow-light delay lines have limited capacity and delay-bandwidth product. In principle, the group velocity in slow-light delay lines can be made to approach zero. But very slow group velocity always comes at the cost of very low bandwidth or throughput. In many applications, miniaturization of the delay line is an important consideration. For all delay-line buffers, the minimum physical size of the buffer for a given number of buffered data bits is ultimately limited by the physical size of each stored bit. We show that in slow-light optical buffers, the minimum achievable size of 1 b is approximately equal to the wavelength of light in the buffer. We also compare the capabilities and limitations of a range of delay-line buffers, investigate the impact of waveguide losses on the buffer capacity, and look at the applicability of slow-light delay lines in a number of applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow-light optical buffers: capabilities and fundamental limitations","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.853125","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33235/01566732.pdf","startPage":"4046","endPage":"4066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.853125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Slow-light optical buffers: capabilities and fundamental limitations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1566732/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8941459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow-light optical buffers: capabilities and fundamental limitations","sourcePdf":"01566732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104376S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"352","xplore-issue":"33235","articleId":"1566732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1566733,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A new generation of optical networks, referred to as all-optical networks, overcomes this limitation by switching data entirely optically using all-optical crossconnects (OXCs). However, all-optical networks are prone to phenomena that are unknown to current optical networks with electrical regeneration: OXCs are subject to optical leaks, called crosstalk, resulting in unwanted components being added to transmitted signals, and this crosstalk is transmitted over very long paths without any signal regeneration. In this paper, we consider the interplay between fiber nonlinearity and crosstalk signals over long distances as the source of performance degradation, measured in terms of Q factor. We present an analytical crosstalk model for all-optical networks and give expressions for the performance degradation resulting from the joint propagation of a signal [using a continuous-wave (CW) assumption and perturbation theory] and crosstalk in large networks. Analytical calculations required by this model are shown to be much less computationally intensive than simulations. Simulations are carried out to validate our analytical model and good agreement is found between the analytical model and simulations for wide ranges of parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33235/01566734.pdf","startPage":"4074","endPage":"4083","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.859432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.859432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical study of crosstalk propagation in all-optical networks using perturbation theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["All-optical networks","Analytical models","Optical fiber networks","Computational modeling","Optical crosstalk","Repeaters","Degradation","Optical propagation","Electronic components","Optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical crosstalk","optical communication equipment","optical fibre networks","perturbation theory","optical switches","optical interconnections","nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk propagation","all-optical networks","perturbation theory","electronic switches","all-optical crossconnects","electrical regeneration","optical leaks","fiber nonlinearity","crosstalk signals","performance degradation","Q factor","analytical crosstalk model","joint signal propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crosstalk","nonlinearities","optical fiber communications","perturbation methods","transparent optical networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analytical study of crosstalk propagation in all-optical networks using perturbation theory","volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1566734/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8941461","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical study of crosstalk propagation in all-optical networks using perturbation theory","sourcePdf":"01566734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127852S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"33235","articleId":"1566734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566736,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Sik Cho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/33235/1566736/1566736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tae-Sik Cho was born in Suncheon, Korea, in 1974.

We consider the effects of laser phase noise and of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), which can arise from local oscillator (LO) shot noise or LO-spontaneous beat noise. We identify 8- and 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes that perform well when the receiver phase-locked loop (PLL) tracks the instantaneous signal phase with moderate phase error. We propose implementations of 8- and 16-QAM transmitters using Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulators. We outline a numerical method for computing the bit error rate (BER) of 8- and 16-QAM in the presence of AWGN and phase error. It is found that these schemes can tolerate phase-error standard deviations of 2.48/spl deg/ and 1.24/spl deg/, respectively, for a power penalty of 0.5 dB at a BER of 10/sup -9/. We propose a suitable PLL design and analyze its performance, taking account of laser phase noise, AWGN, and propagation delay within the PLL. Our analysis shows that the phase error depends on the constellation penalty, which is the mean power of constellation symbols times the mean inverse power. We establish a procedure for finding the optimal PLL natural frequency, and determine tolerable laser linewidths and PLL propagation delays. For zero propagation delay, 8- and 16-QAM can tolerate linewidth-to-bit-rate ratios of 1.8/spl times/10/sup -5/ and 1.4/spl times/10/sup -6/, respectively, assuming a total penalty of 1.0 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.859428","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33235/01566738.pdf","startPage":"4110","endPage":"4124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.859428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier synchronization for 3- and 4-bit-per-symbol optical transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1566738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566738/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier synchronization for 3- and 4-bit-per-symbol optical transmission","volume":"23","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8941465","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566738/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier synchronization for 3- and 4-bit-per-symbol optical transmission","sourcePdf":"01566738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071283S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"33235","articleId":"1566738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1566750,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is demonstrated that external light injection into SOAs could change the signal gain by varying the depth of gain saturation while retaining their saturation output power. This feature is very important in SOAs when amplifying signals modulated in the gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) range because the average output level of SOAs must be limited to a value several decibels lower than the saturation output power to prevent signal distortions due to the pattern effect. For signals modulated at 10 Gb/s in the nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) format, the upper limit for allowable signal input power increased by > 13.5 dB, while retaining good eye patterns in a signal-wavelength range between 1530 and 1560 nm. Consequently, output-level control with a constant output power of +10 dBm was demonstrated for a wide input dynamic range of 13.5 dB in the signal-wavelength range. This method of controlling the output level of SOAs is promising for equalizing the signal power in future photonic network systems because the short carrier lifetime of SOAs can provide extremely fast gain control.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.858248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.858248","startPage":"4332","endPage":"4341","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/33235/01566762.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output-level control of semiconductor optical amplifier by external light injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Output-level control of semiconductor optical amplifier by external light injection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1566762/","accessionNumber":"8941489","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1566762/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output-level control of semiconductor optical amplifier by external light injection","sourcePdf":"01566762.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055572S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"33235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33235","articleId":"1566762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1566767,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, when mismatches between the actual and presumed array responses to the desired signal may frequently occur in practical situations, the performance of the Capon beamformer is known to degrade substantially. The similar type of performance degradation can occur when the signal steering vector is known exactly but the training sample size is small. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to robust Capon beamforming. The proposed robust Capon beamformer provides excellent robustness against some types of mismatches, offers faster convergence rate and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Computer simulations show better performance of our proposed robust Capon beamformer than that of the standard Capon beamformer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1566817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33236","startPage":"140","endPage":"143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

In general, we focus on the real linear instantaneous mixture of real mutually statistically independent sources. When the column vectors of mixing matrix are uncorrelated, it has the possibility that some noise subspaces and signal vectors can be defined. In this way, in this paper, a new simple method of blind source separation is proposed by using higher order statistic, which is based on those signal subspaces and the central limit theorem. This method searches directly the row vector of separating matrix at first, and then revise the cost function to continue to search. In our opinion, this method integrates the characteristics of the like fastICA methods and the like InforMax methods. Illustrative examples, which use different mixing matrices, are utilized to demonstrate the ability of the considered method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

The point source model corresponding to discrete direction of arrival (DOA) becomes restrictive and leads to DOA estimation errors. To compensate for this effect, the distributed source model is proposed. In this paper, the coherently distributed source model is analysed. Based on that model, the accurate rotation matrix between the bases of the two signal subspaces is deduced. So an algorithm for the central DOA estimation of distributed sources is proposed based on unitary ESPRIT, which has an ESPRIT-like structure except for the fact that it is formulated in terms of real-valued computations throughout. The algorithm that has lower computational cost can be used for sources with different types of distribution function in MIMO channel. Simulations clearly demonstrate that the proposed method is not only effective, but also increases estimation accuracy compared with standard ESPRIT.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1566871","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

By introducing MQAM, the developed scheme can avoid the performance loss of conventional DSTC schemes based on MPSK modulation due to the decrease of minimum distance between constellation symbols in high spectrum efficiency. Compared with the existing DSTC schemes, the developed scheme has lower computational complexity and simple decoder. Moreover, it can achieve higher code rate in the case of more than two transmitter antennas. Theoretic analysis shows that the scheme has higher coding gain than existing differential unitary space-time coding scheme and differential orthogonal space-time coding scheme, and corresponding simulation results also show that our scheme has lower bit error rate (BER) when compared with the above two schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

ACI decreases the cell coverage and network capacity of wideband CDMA systems. Simulations were adopted to analyze the blocking of user equipments (UEs) in the system. In worst-case scenarios, it is shown that the UE blocking rate could be very high and the cell coverage may shrink seriously due to ACI. Thus the stability of the system might be affected and converged results could not be obtained. A novel approach was adopted to deal with the instability of the systems in these scenarios and obtain statistical results based on the approach.

This scheme used least square to estimate the initial channel with the received training symbol in the frequency domain. But the precondition is assumed that the channel characteristic is identical between the two symbol periods. However, the channel characteristic is always changing in fading channel, which make the above channel estimation is not veracious. So the vector Kalman filter was used to adjust the initial estimated channel error. It is shown that the performance of system is improved highly than before. On the other hand, the complexity of this method is lower than the least square algorithm in timing domain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

To minimize the overall transmit power, we carry out a fixed bit and power allocation over these subchannels by exploring the characteristics of the ordered subchannel gains. The fixed bit and power assignment can be determined by greedy algorithm at the initial stage and utilized without change throughout the data transmission process.

Partial transmit sequence (PTS) is an approach that can significantly improve the statistics of the PAPR of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Guided scrambling is an extension of self-synchronizing scrambling. It is also capable of guiding the scrambling process to produce a balanced encoded bit stream. In this paper, we want to propose a sub-optimal algorithm to optimize the phase factor in PTS. In addition, we integrate guided scrambling coding with this method. The proposed GS-Sub-PTS method can get much more PAPR reduction at expense of incur little error extension and do not require transmission of side information.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1566966","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

The convergence theorem of the neural networks algorithm is presented and proved, and the optimal design method is introduced by designing two kinds of high-order FIR digital filters, i.e., band-pass and multi-band-pass filters. The results of the amplitude responses show that attenuation in stop-bands is more than 290 dB with no ripple and pulse existing in pass-bands, and cutoff frequency of pass-bands and stop-bands is easily controlled precisely.

IMD decreases the cell coverage and network capacity of wideband CDMA systems. Extensive simulations were used to analyze the impact of IMD in user equipments (UEs) and the contribution of IMD interference to the total interference. In worst-case scenarios, it is shown that the downlink outage rate could be very high and the cell coverage may shrink seriously due to IMD. Thus the stability of the system might be affected and converged results could not be obtained. A novel approach was adopted to deal with the instability of the systems in these scenarios and obtain statistical results based on the approach. The results show that the capacity loss decreases exponentially as IIP/sub 3/ increase and the contribution of IMD interference to the total interference also decreases as IIP/sub 3/ increases. The approach adopted in this paper could be utilized in the study of various topics and our results provide meaningful insights for the design of WCDMA networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1567036","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

However, the problem of packet collisions can be solved at the physical (PHY) layer by using signal processing technique. By exploiting orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and spatial division multiple access (SDMA), a decentralized MAC strategy with multi-packet reception (MPR) is proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems. First, employing receive beamforming, we study the possible optimal number of users which are likely to transmit at the same subcarrier and slot to maximize the separable packets subject to their BER (SINR) requirements. Then the transmission probability is designed to achieve the desired number of users. The performance and benefits of the proposed strategy is analyzed analytically and evaluated through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1567074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8734370","htmlLink":"/document/1567074/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multipacket reception in MIMO-OFDM systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipacket reception in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01567074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04683S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10481","isNumber":"33237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10481","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33237","articleId":"1567074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1567080,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Tian","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Dan Tian","id":"37087828359"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Jinkuan Wang","id":"37087142937"},{"name":"Yanbo Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yanbo Xue","id":"37087417282"},{"name":"Guiqin Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Guiqin Xue","id":"37087828862"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9538-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1567080","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1567080","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Array signal processing","Convergence","Steady-state","Noise robustness","Constraint optimization","White noise","Computer simulation","Stability analysis","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","white noise","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural minor component analysis learning rule","steady-state analysis","constrained beamformer power optimization principle","white noise sensitivity control","computer simulations","real-time signal tracking ability","first minor component analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1567080","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

Based on uniform circular antenna at the receiver side, the model of fading spatial correlation is constructed. And also the statistical properties of the space-time channel are investigated. Then using the properties of Wishart distribution, the channel capacity and its upper and lower bounds for MIMO OFDM systems with arbitrary number of antennas are derived for the case where the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. Computer simulation results show that the channel capacity is maximized when the antenna spacing increases to a certain point, and further more, the larger is the scattering angle, the more quickly the channel capacity converges to its maximum.

However, most conventional algorithms such as proportional fairness are throughput optimized. As the demand for real-time traffic increases, it is necessary for scheduling to provide quality of service (QoS) in wireless access part of cdma2000 networks. A unique feature of our work is explicit provisioning of QoS based on differentiated service, which is preferred by standard organization as the principle to provide end-to-end QoS. We apply the method of the sorting of weighted sum to solve the scheduling with QoS guaranteed. When system is not heavily loaded, our scheme can achieve a capacity gain, and also meet the QoS requirements in terms of delay, jitter, and data rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward link scheduling with quality of service guaranteed in cdma2000 1xEV-DO","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Communications and Information Technology, 2005.

In the mean time, as this kind of image is used extensively and any information shouldn't be lost during compression, the lossless compression method seems to be essential. Without an efficient compression scheme, the application of hyperspectral images will be limited. Trellis coded quantization (TCQ) uses the expanded signal set, set partitioning and trellis state transferring ideas from trellis coded modulation (TCM). The mean squared error (MSE) performance of TCQ is excellent with modest computing complexity. At present TCQ is often used for image lossy compression. In this paper, we aim to develop TCQ scheme to compress hyperspectral images losslessly taking advantage of the characteristics of hyperspectral data for compression. A scheme utilizing wavelet transform and trellis coded quantization is presented.

But this algorithm has several disadvantages such as the blindness of searching at the later stage and the poor ability to keep the balance of exploration and exploitation, which reduce its probability of searching the best result. To overcome these problems, two improved AFSA named AAFSA/spl I.bar/FS and AAFSA/spl I.bar/CS are proposed. The improved algorithms can adjust the searching range adaptively and have better ability to keep the balance of exploration and exploitation. Then we apply the new algorithms to solve the multiuser detection problems. Simulation results show that the proposed detectors outperform GA detector and PSO detector in terms of BER, near-far resistant and convergence performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1567151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1567151/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8734447","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser detector based on adaptive artificial fish school algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser detector based on adaptive artificial fish school algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01567151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038891S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10481","isNumber":"33237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10481","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33237","articleId":"1567151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1567175,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The FOPA comprises a typical configuration, in which signal and pump are semiconductor lasers. It can be theoretically shown that both cross-phase modulation (XPM) and parametric amplification can cause the signal polarization change with pump power. It is important to note that, if two orthogonally polarized signals are inserted into the FOPA, any source of birefringence will maintain their orthogonality while the parametric gain will tend to make their polarization parallel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1568314/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9130165","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the signal polarization evolution with pump power in a fibre optical parametric amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the signal polarization evolution with pump power in a fibre optical parametric amplifier","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"01568314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029288S","chronDate":"17-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10486","isNumber":"33242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10486","xplore-issue":"33242","articleId":"1568314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1568520,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this work we present efficient architectures for implementation of zero mean normalized cross correlation using Virtex-4 FPGAs for application to correlation based fingerprint matching. In particular, we compare the implementations of correlation in the spatial and Fourier domains.

The architectures have been implemented and tested using a Panasonic NV-DS60B digital video camera connected to a Celoxica RC300 prototyping platform with a Xilinx Virtex II XC2v6000 FPGA and 4 banks of onboard RAM. The novel FPGA architecture presented has the advantages of minimizing latency and the movement of large datasets, by conducting time critical processes on BlockRAM.

This paper presents GPUs (graphics processing units) as another viable solution, comparing their throughput with that of FPGAs. Previous work on using FPGAs and GPUs for video processing is analysed, grounds for comparison formulated and then exemplified through case studies of primary colour correction and 2D convolution. GPUs are seen to be advantageous in applications utilising their optimised instruction set and which have a low number of memory accesses. We found that for 2D convolution, the throughput of the GPUs exceeds that of FPGAs if the mask dimension is 2 times 2. For mask sizes greater than 4 times 4 and for primary colour correction FPGAs have higher throughput. The GPU implementation of primary colour correction is shown to be capable of a throughput of 63 MP/s (million pixels per second) enough for high definition video at 30 f/s (frames per second). For 2D convolution GPUs achieved the target throughput rate of 8MP/s (512 times 512 frames at 30 f/s) up to size 7 times 7.

The ability to tolerate multiple defects is anticipated to be very important at 45nm and beyond. One possible approach to this growing problem is to add redundancy to create a defect-tolerant FPGA architecture. Using area, delay and yield metrics, this paper compares two redundancy strategies: a coarse-grain approach using spare rows and columns and a fine-grain approach using spare wires. For low defect levels and large array sizes, the coarse-grain approach offers a lower area overhead, but it is relatively intolerant to an increase in defect count. In contrast, the fine-grain approach has a fixed overhead of up to 50%, but the architecture can tolerate an increasing number of defects as array size grows. To achieve a similar level of yield recovery, the coarse-grain approach requires an area overhead in excess of 100%","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2005.1568545","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10488/33244/01568545.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2005.1568545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA defect tolerance: impact of granularity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"FPGA defect tolerance: impact of granularity","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568545/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8825630","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA defect tolerance: impact of granularity","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01568545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042539S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10488","isNumber":"33244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10488","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33244","articleId":"1568545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568547,"authors":[{"name":"I.O.

However, they represent a source of errors in many applications, and the presence of cloud contamination can hinder the use of satellite data. This requires a cloud detection process to mask out cloudy pixels from further processing. The trend for remote sensing satellite missions has always been towards smaller size, lower cost, more flexibility, and higher computational power. Reconfigurable computers (RCs) combine the flexibility of traditional microprocessors with the power of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Therefore, RCs are a promising candidate for on-board preprocessing. This paper presents the design and implementation of an RC-based real-time cloud detection system. We investigate the potential of using RCs for on-board preprocessing by prototyping the Landsat 7 ETM+ ACCA algorithm on one of the state-of-the art reconfigurable platforms, SRC-6E. Although a reasonable amount of investigations of the ACCA cloud detection algorithm using FPGAs has been reported in the literature, very few details/results were provided and/or limited contributions were accomplished.

The prototype has been implemented on a board including both an ARM processor and a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and it supports the simulation of a 40 MHz radio frequency bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2005.1568572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10488/33244/01568572.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2005.1568572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance channel model hardware emulator for 802.11n","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1568572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568572/","displayDocTitle":"High performance channel model hardware emulator for 802.11n","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8815630","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568572/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance channel model hardware emulator for 802.11n","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"01568572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047112S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10488","isNumber":"33244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10488","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33244","articleId":"1568572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568575,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Shu","affiliation":["ECE Department, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Chang Shu","id":"37551792300"},{"name":"K.

Since typical SMDs contain implantable parts, low power consumption and high reliability are among the main criteria that must be given priority when designing such wirelessly powered microsystems. In order to calibrate the total inductively transmitted power to an implant, a wireless feedback loop is used. In addition, this inductive link allows full-duplex high data-rate communication, accomplished with a differential hard-limited Costas loop. A typical device, for monitoring and microstimulating the cortical tissues, comprises several integrated modules assembled on a thin substrate, providing placement flexibility in the body.

System analysis shows that adaptive antenna-rake combining techniques can significantly enhance the performance and capacity of cellular systems compared to conventional CDMA systems.

Moreover, the proposed architectures allows for a dynamic and flexible allocation of available processing resources (total of 20 fingers) to different antennas and multipaths based on the instantaneous channel profile. The presented receiver can operate in both normal and space time transmit diversity (STTD) modes.

The effectiveness of these operations depends on the ability to accurately determine which portions of logic are timing critical at a stage of the CAD flow where there is still freedom to perform logic restructuring.

Finally, it is shown that our improved ASIC flow approach can create layouts that are competitive with another approach called GILES that uses custom FPGA CAD tools and nonstandard cells for tile layout purposes.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568636","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568636.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1568636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved \"soft\" eFPGA design and implementation strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568636/","displayDocTitle":"An improved \"soft\" eFPGA design and implementation strategy","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568636/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8814902","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved \"soft\" eFPGA design and implementation strategy","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061872S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568637,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose a new tri-level voltage word-line control (3LV-WL) scheme to clearly operate set operations. Moreover, we investigated the read disturb operation and developed a new reduced-actual-read-access (RA2) scheme to attain 500 times the read retention time. We also developed a source line control (SLC) scheme to attain an 18% smaller cell size and a 19-F/sup 2/ memory cell with enough reset current to clearly reset the PC material. With the application of these approaches, we established reset/set/read operations with the lowest possible voltage, 1.5 V with logic CMOS, for a low-cost embedded memory with a few additional masks.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568698","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568698.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase change RAM operated with 1.5-V CMOS as low cost embedded memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Phase change RAM operated with 1.5-V CMOS as low cost embedded memory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8834563","htmlLink":"/document/1568698/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase change RAM operated with 1.5-V CMOS as low cost embedded memory","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071786S","chronDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568700,"authors":[{"name":"Ik Joon Chang","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Ik Joon Chang","id":"37563254900"},{"name":"Kunhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Kunhyuk Kang","id":"37292233800"},{"name":"S.

To achieve reasonable compromise in ASIC design, device-and process-level characterization of physical designs is a fundamental requirement. In this paper, we address topics regarding \"design for variability\", which are increasingly important in the 65- to 90-nm technology era. We have developed a new test-structure to precisely measure the on-chip variation of key LSI components (MOST, R, C, and circuit-delay). Statistical analysis of the experimental results revealed that the 3/spl sigma/ variation of MOS drive-current within a chip was 30%, which led to equal variation in the circuit propagation delay (Tpd). We found that variation can be suppressed due to its randomness features in multi-stage circuitry and high-performance, large-gate-area driver CMOS devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568738.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1568738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenge: variability characterization and modeling for 65- to 90-nm processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Semiconductor device measurement","Crosstalk","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit interconnections","Optical control","Application specific integrated circuits","Propagation delay","Circuit noise","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large scale integration","integrated circuit design","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variability characterization","variability modeling","design for variability","test-structure","on-chip variation","LSI components","statistical analysis","MOS drive-current","circuit propagation delay","multi-stage circuitry","large-gate-area driver","CMOS devices","65 to 90 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Challenge: variability characterization and modeling for 65- to 90-nm processes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8789187","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenge: variability characterization and modeling for 65- to 90-nm processes","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051062S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568740,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The latest CMOS technologies, optimized for parameters suited to digital designs only, are forcing the analog and mixed-signal designers to make multi-dimensional trade-offs. In general, the lack of adequate analog device characterization and inaccurate SPICE models mandate several expensive additional design and fabrication iterations before arriving at an acceptable solution. Sometimes, the task is further complicated by the difficulty in even making reliable lab measurements due to accuracy issues caused by probing noise, minuscule device sizing, dynamic effects and loading. This paper summarizes the harmonic characterization techniques used to estimate the mismatches in the minimal size inversion-type CMOS varactors in a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). The DCO is a centerpiece of the first ever all-digital phase locked loop (ADPLL) fabricated in 90 nm digital CMOS that meets the challenging GSM performance specifications. Simulation as well as lab measurements confirm that the tracking bank varactors have a better than 5.5% mismatch, thus contributing to the excellent modulation performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568740","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568740.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"608","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of deep-submicron varactor mismatches in a digitally controlled oscillator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of deep-submicron varactor mismatches in a digitally controlled oscillator","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1568740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8789188","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568740/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of deep-submicron varactor mismatches in a digitally controlled oscillator","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07165S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1568751,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Xinyu Yu","id":"37087625368"},{"name":"S.L.

As system architects and designers leverage ever-increasing CMOS technology densities, a range of two and three dimensional silicon integration technologies are emerging which likely support next generation high-volume electronic applications and may serve high-performance computing applications. This paper discusses a few emerging technologies which offer opportunities for circuit integration on-chip as well as on-package using fine pitch interconnection, silicon wafer processing and silicon carrier packaging technology. Advanced silicon carrier package technology with fine pitch (50/spl mu/m) interconnection is described. This silicon carrier package contains silicon through-vias and offers >16/spl times/ increase over standard chip I/O, a 20/spl times/ to 100/spl times/ increase in wiring density over traditional organic and ceramic packaging, and allows for integrated high performance passives. Silicon carrier technology supports lithographic scaling and provides a basis for known good die (KGD) wafer testing. It may be considered for use in a number of applications including optoelectronic (OE) transceivers and mini-multi-chip modules (MMCM) which integrate heterogeneous dies forming a single \"virtual chip\".","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568756","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568756.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three dimensional silicon integration using fine pitch interconnection, silicon processing and silicon carrier packaging technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1568756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568756/","displayDocTitle":"Three dimensional silicon integration using fine pitch interconnection, silicon processing and silicon carrier packaging technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8834585","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568756/","conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three dimensional silicon integration using fine pitch interconnection, silicon processing and silicon carrier packaging technology","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104569S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1568762,"authors":[{"name":"Leibo Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Leibo Liu","id":"37280777600"},{"name":"Hongying Meng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hongying Meng","id":"37276215800"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Zhang","id":"37280171800"},{"name":"Zhihua Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhihua Wang","id":"37279252700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9023-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"}],"articleNumber":"1568762","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Codecs","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filters","Block codes","Wavelet coefficients","Computer architecture","Rate-distortion","Transform coding","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","image coding","data compression","codecs","block codes","discrete wavelet transforms","clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC implementation","JPEG2000 codec","discrete wavelet transform","DWT","spatial combinative lifting algorithm","lifting based implementation","embedded block coding with optimized truncation","EBCOT","dynamic memory control","on-chip wavelet coefficient storage","rate-distortion truncation","compression bit-rate","power consumption","100 MHz","465 mW","1.8 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed an ASIC implementation of JPEG2000 codec.

Current work on highly integrated power management applications often requires the ability to measure voltage quantities that exceed the supply voltage in magnitude. This is primarily due to a basic need to maximize efficiency by running the power management IC on as low supply voltage as possible, while still maintaining the ability to sample and measure quantities from the surroundings that could well exceed the battery voltage. In this paper a new bootstrapped switch is presented. The switch enables the precise sampling of input signals well greater than the chip supply voltage with no static power consumption, and without activating on-chip parasitic body diodes. The bootstrapped switch, presented here, is designed to sample an input signal with a 0-5.5 V range at a supply voltage of 2.75 V. Measurement data shows functionality for a 0-6 V input signal range with a supply voltage as low as 1.2 V","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2005.1568775","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10489/33245/01568775.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"746","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2005.1568775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bootstrapped switch for precise sampling of inputs with signal range beyond supply voltage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A bootstrapped switch for precise sampling of inputs with signal range beyond supply voltage","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1568775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8824445","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568775/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bootstrapped switch for precise sampling of inputs with signal range beyond supply voltage","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035726S","chronDate":"21-21 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10489","isNumber":"33245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10489","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33245","articleId":"1568775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1568776,"authors":[{"name":"T.

On the other hand, Cognitive radios attempt to share spectra by introducing a spectrum sensing function, so that they are able to transmit in unused portions at a given time, place and frequency.

For complexity reasons, most stimuli generators use sequential solutions without planning ahead. Therefore, in many cases they fail to produce consistent stimuli due to an inadequate selection of the initial state. We propose a method, based on machine learning techniques, to improve generation success by learning the relationship between the initial state vector and generation success. We applied the proposed method in two different settings, with the objective of improving generation success and coverage in processor and system level generation. In both settings, the proposed method significantly reduced generation failures and enabled faster coverage.","doi":"10.1109/HLDVT.2005.1568823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HLDVT.2005.1568823","startPage":"112","endPage":"118","displayPublicationTitle":"Tenth IEEE International High-Level Design Validation and Test Workshop, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10490/33246/01568823.pdf","publicationTitle":"Tenth IEEE International High-Level Design Validation and Test Workshop, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harnessing machine learning to improve the success rate of stimuli generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Harnessing machine learning to improve the success rate of stimuli generation","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568823/","accessionNumber":"8789258","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568823/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harnessing machine learning to improve the success rate of stimuli generation","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069619S","chronDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10490","isNumber":"33246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33246","articleId":"1568823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1568841,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Although advances in formal methods have improved some aspects of the task, software simulation remains the primary method of functional verification. Traditionally, heuristic coverage metrics have been used to evaluate the simulation-based validation process and the development of coverage-driven random-based test bench generation techniques is allowing the automation of the functional verification process. This coverage-based approach has a very serious disadvantage: the metrics have no formal meaning and so there is no direct correlation between classes of bugs and coverage metrics. The main goal of this paper is to explore methods that provide a formal meaning to coverage metrics with random test benches. They are independent of a particular fault or bug model. The methods are based on polynomial models of the system under verification and they can evaluate data and control statements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formal meaning of coverage metrics in simulation-based hardware design verification","publicationTitle":"Tenth IEEE International High-Level Design Validation and Test Workshop, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/HLDVT.2005.1568841","displayPublicationTitle":"Tenth IEEE International High-Level Design Validation and Test Workshop, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10490/33246/01568841.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HLDVT.2005.1568841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1568841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1568841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Formal meaning of coverage metrics in simulation-based hardware design verification","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1568841/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8835285","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal meaning of coverage metrics in simulation-based hardware design verification","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01568841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070829S","chronDate":"30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10490","isNumber":"33246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33246","articleId":"1568841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1568852,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

The proposed antenna system includes a re-configurable rectangular spiral antenna with a set of MEMS switches, which are monolithically integrated onto the same substrate printed circuit board (/spl epsiv//sub r/=3.27 and tan /spl delta/=0.004). The system is based on a single-arm rectangular spiral antenna, capable of changing its radiation pattern using RF-MEMS switches. The spiral is made out of multiple segments, which are interconnected by RF-MEMS switches strategically located along the spiral. On activating these switches, the spiral overall arm length is changed and consequently its radiation beam direction is changed. The antenna radiates right hand circular polarization (RHCP). The gain of the antenna varies between 3/spl sim/6 dBi, and satisfies the 3-dB axial ratio criterion at the operating frequency band of 10 GHz. The excellent performance of the proposed system emphasizes the importance of being able to integrate MEMS switches into the same low loss substrate for antenna applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic integrated re-configurable antenna with RF-MEMS switches fabricated on printed circuit board","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

To obtain the accurate angular velocity from Hall-effect sensor measurements, the angular velocity calculation algorithm is proposed by including the measurement noise reduction logics. Apart from the previous works based on the angular velocity or torque estimates for detecting the pinched condition, the proposed pinch detection algorithm makes use of the torque rate information. To do this, the torque rate is augmented to the system model and the torque rate estimator is derived by applying the steady-state Kalman filter recursion to the model. The motivation of this approach comes from the idea that the torque rate is less sensitive to the motor parameter uncertainties. Hence, the proposed scheme minimizes the anti-pinch window control system's exposure to the false alarm. To detect the pinched condition, a systematic way to determine the threshold level of the torque rate estimates is also suggested via the deterministic estimation error analysis. Experimental results certify the pinch detection performance of the proposed algorithm and its robustness against the motor parameter uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2005.1568915","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

By comparing consecutive frames against each other and calculating the expansion rate of the features found in the images, we are able to determine how far away we are from the objects we are viewing. This rate of expansion is found by performing a linear search between the two images, using a scalar and a shift to find the best match of the feature between the two images. Once this match is found, a time to impact in terms of frames is calculated and with such information, the robot is able to discover the distance to the object and make plans accordingly.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2005.1568930","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

This paper shows that field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are especially suited to fulfil these requirements; FPGAs are very powerful, relatively inexpensive, and adaptable, since their configuration is specified in an abstract hardware description language. In addition to the benefits resulting from using an FPGA, the case study presented here shows how FPGAs can be used for implementing a sophisticated multiprocessor architecture. In the course of presentation, this paper furthermore argues that due to the excellent tool support and the availability of reusable functional modules (also known as intellectual properties) this approach can be adopted by almost any industrial hardware designer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages of FPGA-based multiprocessor systems in industrial applications","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

The algorithm in which a special coordinate transformation is introduced can easily identify the three vertices of small triangle that reference vector falls into, as well as corresponding duration time. And different objectives of multilevel converters can be accomplished with appropriate selection of zero-sequence components in each sampling period. This algorithm can be easily implemented without calculation of trigonometric function, and is applicable to different topologies with any number of levels.

For this system, a power conversion circuit is necessary to interface the generated power to the utility. In many cases, a high step-up DC/DC converter is needed to boost low input voltage to high voltage output. Conventional methods using cascade DC/DC converters cause extra complexity and higher cost. The conventional topologies to get high output voltage use flyback DC/DC converters. They have the leakage components that cause stress and loss of energy that results in low efficiency. This paper presents a high boost converter with a voltage multiplier and a coupled inductor. The secondary voltage of the coupled inductor is rectified using a voltage multiplier. High boost voltage is obtained with low duty cycle.

This paper proposes a neural network solution methodology for the problem of measuring the actual amount of harmonic current injected into a power network by a nonlinear load. The determination of harmonic currents is complicated by the fact that the supply voltage waveform is distorted by other loads and is rarely a pure sinusoid. A recurrent neural network trained with the backpropagation through time (BPTT) training algorithm is used to find a way of distinguishing between the load harmonics and supply harmonics, without disconnecting the load from the network. The biggest advantage of this method is that only waveforms of voltages and currents have to be measured. This method is applicable for both single and three phase loads.

This approach provides the solution for the low cost FPGA ANN chip. In order to reduce the scale of the digital circuits to implement ANN, stochastic principles are introduced to employ the simplified feed-forward neural network.

Resonant inverter differs from resonant converter in that the output side of the inverter is subject to linear load directly, while in the converter, a rectifier is followed by a filter with much lower resonant frequency compared to the operation frequency. The resonant inverter in AC DPS is complicated by the factors that the load impedance is unknown and the input line voltage varies for a wide range. Soft-switching design of the resonant inverter is challenging because it is mandatory to take into consideration of load of different power factors as well as the wide input range. Analysis and design curves for the inverter with a general load model are developed and analyzed for non-resistive load conditions. Experimental verifications on one prototype inverter of 1 MHz, output power 150 W at 28 V RMS are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569074/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8923340","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1569074/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of full bridge resonant inverter for high frequency AC distributed power system application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of full bridge resonant inverter for high frequency AC distributed power system application","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01569074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08148S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10487","isNumber":"33243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10487","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33243","articleId":"1569074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1569083,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Industry Application Research Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Hyun Kim","id":"37087254849"},{"name":"Myung-Hyo Ryu","affiliation":["Industry Application Research Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Hyo Ryu","id":"37087818085"},{"name":"Byung-Duk Min","affiliation":["Industry Application Research Laboratory, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Duk Min","id":"37087254465"},{"name":"S.V.

They present several advantages compared to the three-leg converter topologies. Recently the control complexity has been reduced thanks to the use of new and powerful microprocessor systems, hence the balance of the DC-link voltage is the major drawback of this kind of topologies. In this paper, the first control strategy to carry out the balance of the DC-link voltage in the multilevel four-leg four-wire diode-clamped converter is presented. This strategy uses the known technique based on choosing the most suitable redundant vector in the space vector modulation algorithm in order to reduce the unbalance. It is important to notice that the proposed method is independent of the load and independent of the number of levels of the converter. Some simulation results show the obtained balance using the proposed technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2005.1569085","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

In this paper, observer and artificial neural network (ANN)-based novel flux linkage control of SRM drives is presented and examined as an alternate approach to current control. The main advantage of flux linkage control is computational simplicity due to the insensitivity of controller gains to machine operation conditions, while current control depends on controller gains which are very sensitive to self-inductance of SRMs. Flux linkage control needs a reliable flux linkage estimator for desirable control of SRMs. Integration method to estimate flux linkage from measured phase voltages, currents and resistances is commonly used, but it is sensitive to measurement error and white noise. Another way to measure the flux linkage is to use a look-up table which is very sensitive to input currents because it is current- and position-based data. In this paper, a simple observer-based voltage and ANN-based current correction method is proposed to overcome the measurement error. Furthermore, ANNs with two layers and five neurons are applied to produce an acceptable flux linkage estimate at each corrected current and measured position, instead of a look-up table. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate its performance.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2005.1569115","pdfPath":"/iel5/10487/33243/01569115.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

It is difficult to diagnose a multilevel-inverter drive (MLID) system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Five multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The neural network design process is clearly described. The classification performance of the proposed network between normal and abnormal condition is about 90 %, and the classification performance among fault features is about 85 %. Thus, by utilizing the proposed neural network fault diagnosis system, a better understanding about fault behaviors, diagnostics, and detections of a multilevel inverter drive system can be accomplished. The results of this analysis are identified in percentage tabular form of faults and switch locations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2005.1569119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33243","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

The development of high performance speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive based on this SoPC environment is presented in this paper. Firstly, the mathematic model of PMSM is defined and the vector control used in the current loop of the PMSM drive is explained. Then, an adaptive fuzzy controller is constructed by using the fuzzy basis function and parameter adjustable mechanism, which is used to cope with the dynamic uncertainty and external load effect in the PMSM drive. After that, a FPGA-based control IC is designed to realize the controllers. The FPGA-based control IC has two IPs, an Nios embedded processor IP and an application IP. The Nios processor is used to perform the function of an adaptive fuzzy control in speed loop of PMSM drive. The application IP is used to perform the current vector control of the PMSM drive, which includes SVPWM generation, coordinate transformation, PI controller and the pulse detection of the quadrature encoder. The former is implemented by using software due to the complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (speed control: less than 1 kHz). The latter is implemented by hardware due to the need of high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16 kHz, PWM circuit: 4/spl sim/8 MHz) but simple computation. At last, an experimental system has been set up and some experimental results have been demonstrated.","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

An accurate model of radial force and torque is the basis of precise and fast rotor position control in bearingless SRM. This paper presents a new non-linear modeling method of bearingless SRM using finite element method (FEM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The new method is superior to the previous ones because of its consideration of the non-linearity of magnetic field in bearingless SRM. Furthermore, a novel instantaneous radial force control scheme direct radial force control (DRFC), is proposed in this paper. The new model and DRFC are proved to be more effective than the original control scheme by the simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569150/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8923397","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1569150/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modelling and control of bearingless switched reluctance motor based on artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and control of bearingless switched reluctance motor based on artificial neural network","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"01569150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059255S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10487","isNumber":"33243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10487","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33243","articleId":"1569150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1569161,"authors":[{"name":"Xianzhong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xianzhong Dai","id":"37087185254"},{"name":"Guohai Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"lastName":"Guohai Liu","id":"37087283600"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"lastName":"Hao Zhang","id":"37087152402"},{"name":"Xinghua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xinghua Zhang","id":"37087497711"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9252-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"1569161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1569161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Frequency","Intelligent networks","Inverters","Induction motors","Chemical industry","Nonlinear control systems","Machine vector control","Electric variables control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","invertors","machine control","frequency control","angular velocity control","linear systems","closed loop systems","electric machine analysis computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network inverse control","variable frequency speed-regulating system","V-F mode","induction motor","low-cost inverter","mathematic model","inverse model","pseudolinear system","linear close-loop adjuster"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2005.1569161","pdfPath":"/iel5/10487/33243/01569161.pdf","publicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

So it is useful to improve its control performance without changing the original structure of variable frequency speed-regulating system (VFSRS). Considering the induction motor and the inverter as a whole controlled object, a mathematic model of such variable frequency speed-regulating system in V/F and its inverse model, with or without compensation, are given in this paper. Constructing a neural network inverse and combining it with the variable frequency speed-regulating system in V/F, a pseudo-linear system is completed. Then a linear close-loop adjuster is designed to obtain a better speed-regulating performance. Results of experiments demonstrate that speed-regulating performances can be greatly improved using this simple method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569161/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8923408","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1569161/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network inverse control of variable frequency speed-regulating system in V/F mode","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network inverse control of variable frequency speed-regulating system in V/F mode","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC","sourcePdf":"01569161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065306S","chronDate":"6-10 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10487","isNumber":"33243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10487","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33243","articleId":"1569161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1569163,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The main problem in adaptive feed back linearization method is determination of its feed back coefficients, multi-objective optimization based on genetic algorithm is proposed as an stochastic method to determine the coefficients.

Among the different working principles of tactile sensors, the resistive is of particular interest. Those sensors are constructed in a simple way, are insensitive to shock and overdrive and can be designed with both, a high spatial resolution and a large sensing area. Conventional resistive tactile sensors are based on two electrode layers, located on opposed sides of a conductive polymer. Since this design has disadvantages affecting lifetime, we use a onesided contacting by the use of a regular electrode matrix. However, this increases the signal processing circuit's complexity. This paper introduces a novel kind of resistive tactile sensor matrix with an inter-electrode sampling technique for high speed measurements at an reduced number of electrodes and therefore a reduced complexity. The design of such sensor matrices is described and a method for comparing their performance based on the matrix efficiency is introduced.

The shoulder has three degrees of freedom rotational motion produced by four hydraulic cylinders which makes it a redundant parallel robotic shoulder. Unlike the serial robots, forward kinematics problem of parallel robots is not easily solved because of the nonlinearity and complexity of the parallel robot's kinematic equations and there are several solutions which are almost impossible to be found analytically. The neural network used in this paper is of the feedforward net type and a multi-layer back propagation procedure is utilized to train the network. A simulation study is performed using two types of trajectories to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method in solving the forward kinematics problem of the redundant mechanism.

The bandwidth of force sensing and friction compensation are very important problems for reproduction of vivid force sensation. In this paper, an environment quarrier is proposed for bilateral teleoperation instead of force sensors. The environment quarrier is a novel force sensing method which consists of a twin robot system. Two same types of robots are required and they are controlled in the same position, velocity and acceleration by bilateral acceleration control based on a disturbance observer. One robot is in contact motion and the other is unconstrained. The purity of external force is obtained by subtracting the disturbance torque in the unconstrained robot from the constrained one. The environment quarrier can observe the external force with high bandwidth and friction compensation. In order to implement the environment quarrier to a bilateral control system, four robots are required. In this paper, the idea of multilateral control is introduced for attainment of simultaneity. Furthermore, this paper shows that the controller design of the multilateral control in the modal space. The experimental results showed the viability of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2005.1569216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2005.1569216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33243","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

The proposed control architecture has been applied for SIMO converters operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM), where there is a cross-regulation issue between output voltages. The adopted control includes a separate regulation of the common-mode and the generalised differential-mode output voltages for the input half-bridge and for the output switches respectively. Due to the differential-mode control loop dependence on the load current, an inductor current estimation is used to perform a variable gain for the differential-mode regulation. Moreover, a non-linear evaluation of the common-mode voltage have been investigated in order to improve the system dynamic response at different load conditions. Even if aimed to an integrated solution, experimental investigation has been performed using discrete components, implementing the digital control in a field programmable gate array (FPGA).

In this paper, it is proposed an algorithm software phase-locked loop (SPLL) to obtain phase and frequency information of the grid voltage. This is based in an algorithm of on-line separation of the grid voltage sequences (DSC), and a discrete traditional PLL. A criterion to tune the SPLL constants from a PLL discrete linearized model is discussed. The SPLL response is evaluated for different grid disturbances and different SPLL parameters. Besides, a VSC connected to the grid through and L filter with the SPLL obtained in this paper has been tested for different configurations of SPLL and different grid perturbations. Conclusions about where to apply the SPLL different configurations are obtained from these last tests.","displayPublicationTitle":"31st Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 2005.

This paper proposes a complete overview of energy distribution in UWB IEEE channel models. At first, realistic large scale parameters, such as path loss or fading margin, are considered for an accurate link budget analysis. Then, the energy repartition in the channel is modeled so as to specify optimal integration windows and detection performances in non-coherent receiver architectures based on energy collection for both communication and ranging requirements. Moreover, the expected voltage at antenna is analyzed in order to define the receiver sensitivity as a function of range. At last, we focus on auto and cross correlation of channel impulse responses for the purpose of estimating the multi-user capability. For each of the investigated items, some illustrating samples are provided and major implications for real UWB systems are derived and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569946/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8902036","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1569946/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy characteristics of UWB channel models applied to system design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy characteristics of UWB channel models applied to system design","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01569946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066626S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1569946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1569949,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To optimize receiver structures and antennas for UWB WBANs it is necessary to know the propagation mechanisms at the human body. In this paper, we focus on transmission at the head and consider direct transmission, surface waves, reflections, and diffraction as possible propagation mechanisms in the frequency range between 1.5-8 GHz. We show theoretically and by measurement results that the direct path is attenuated such that direct transmission through the head is negligible. Based on measurements we conclude by process of elimination that diffraction is the main propagation mechanism around the human body and that surface waves and reflections are negligible. Finally, we discuss the impact of the propagation mechanisms on the UWB WBAN communication system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1569949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01569949.pdf","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation effects in UWB body area networks","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1569949","startPage":"16","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1569949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Propagation effects in UWB body area networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569949/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8893435","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1569949/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation effects in UWB body area networks","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01569949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055204S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1569949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1569952,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The combined M-ary code shift (MCS)/DCSK shifts the reference-information signal pair to the location determined by (log/sub 2/ M)-bit data, hence transmitting a (1 + log/sub 2/ M)-bit symbol for the duration of one bit transmitted using DCSK, which in turn can be used to increase the silent periods within and between transmitted signal pairs. The resulting signaling format improves the bit error probability (BEP) performance of DCSK-based systems without altering the receiver structure or increasing the computational complexity, and provides longer silent periods to combat the worse effects of multipath (MP) fading.

Our methodology consists of (a) development and quantification of appropriate information-theoretic performance measures, and (b) comparison of these measures with simulation results for the multiband OFDM standard proposal as well as our proposed extensions. We find that the current multiband OFDM standard proposal sufficiently exploits the frequency selectivity of the UWB channel, and that the system performs in the vicinity of the channel cutoff rate.

A simple channel model is presented in which the average power delay profile is an explicit feature. The corresponding maximum-likelihood receiver turns out to be a noncoherent receiver which, in contrast to the noncoherent receiver without channel state information, applies an appropriate weighting to the received signal. The performance of this new receiver is evaluated by simulation and for a practical channel estimation procedure. The results show a performance improvement due to partial channel state information of up to 2 dB.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01569980.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1569980","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1569980","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1569980","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Bit error rate","Delay","RAKE receivers","Maximum likelihood estimation","Pulse modulation","Pulse shaping methods","Channel estimation","Shape","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband communication","channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsed UWB signals","partial channel state information","power delay profile","average power delay profile","maximum-likelihood receiver","noncoherent receiver","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569980/","displayDocTitle":"ML receiver for pulsed UWB signals and partial channel state information","accessionNumber":"8874081","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1569980/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML receiver for pulsed UWB signals and partial channel state information","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01569980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056077S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1569980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1569987,"authors":[{"name":"Oh-Soon Shin","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"lastName":"Oh-Soon Shin","id":"37271728500"},{"name":"S.S.

One proposal is referred to as multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM), and the other is direct-sequence ultra-wideband (DS-UWB). In this paper, we evaluate the performance of these physical layers as proposed to the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 3a. Specifically, we evaluate and compare the 10% outage frame error rate (FER) versus transmit-receive distance for the two systems using standard UWB channel models. In an AWGN channel, the two approaches yield essentially the same performance. In fading channels, the MB-OFDM system is shown to outperform the DS-UWB system for the assumed receiver structures. However, the relative performance ranking turns primarily on the signal processing complexity of the receiver, especially at high rates. Furthermore, the DS-UWB system is found to be more robust to imperfect channel estimation than the MB-OFDM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of MB-OFDM and DS-UWB systems for wireless personal area networks","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1569987","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01569987.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1569987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1569987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1569987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of MB-OFDM and DS-UWB systems for wireless personal area networks","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1569987/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8874066","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of MB-OFDM and DS-UWB systems for wireless personal area networks","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01569987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089592S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1569987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
