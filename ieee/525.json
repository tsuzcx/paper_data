ADMA is a new MIMO multiple access system that is designed for effectively eliminating interferences and hence opening new frontiers for wireless communication systems. A fundamental problem for signal processing is the separation two signals from their mixture. The problem would be simpler if they are non-overlapping in either time domain or frequency domain. The time division multiple access system (TDMA) explores the diversity in time and the frequency division multiple access system (FDMA) explores the diversity in frequency. Two signals may be overlapping in both time and frequency, but they still can be easily separated if they are uncorrelated (orthogonal). The code division multiple access system (CDMA) explores orthogonal property of the signal codes. It may be interesting to know that two signals may be overlapping in both the frequency and time domain and also are not orthogonal to each other, but they can still be separated if their autocorrelations are separable in the domain of time-lags. The autocorrelation division multiple access system (ADMA) explores the diversity of autocorrelation of signals. In a multiple access system, many users share the same communication channel and hence they interfere with each other. However, these interferences can be easily taken care of by using the orthogonal structure of the multiple access systems. The interferences that are difficult to deal with are the ones that are not coordinated with the multiple access system they are using. Examples of such interferences are those at the boundary of cells of a cellular mobile phone system. The (intentional) jamming signal is another example. The uncoordinated interference in unlicensed spectrum is the major road block for wireless communications. ADMA is an effective way to reduce the uncoordinated interferences. By a simulation study, the uncoordinated interference to signal ratio can be reduced from 100 times to 0.01 times in the same frequency bandwidth. With such an interference-rejection capability, ADMA technology can make new frontiers for the wireless industry. In this presentation, we will show how the autocorrelation diversity can be explored to effectively reducing the uncoordinated inferences even when they are correlated with the signal. This includes the ADMA encoder, the ADMA filtering and the ADMA decoder. We will demonstrate that the ADMA filtering processing is noise invariant. In order to show the potential of ADMA, the spectrum efficiency of a mobile phone system is investigated. It can be shown by simulation that the spectrum efficiency can be improved by a factor of two without the need for channel estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250298.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autocorrelation division multiple access systems (ADMA)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Interference","Wireless communication","Signal processing","Time division multiple access","Frequency conversion","Multiaccess communication","Mobile handsets","Filtering","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel coding","code division multiple access","correlation methods","filtering theory","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","jamming","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","signal processing","time division multiple access","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autocorrelation division multiple access system","MIMO multiple access system","uncoordinated interference elimination","wireless communication system","signal processing","time domain analysis","frequency domain analysis","time division multiple access system","TDMA","frequency division multiple access system","FDMA","code division multiple access system","CDMA","orthogonal code","communication channel","cellular mobile phone system","jamming signal","unlicensed spectrum","interference rejection","ADMA encoder","ADMA filtering","ADMA decoder","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Autocorrelation division multiple access systems (ADMA)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10878934","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autocorrelation division multiple access systems (ADMA)","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"KeynoteSpeechAbstractsd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036484S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5250298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5250319,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chang Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Chang Lu","id":"37406515900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250319","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stacking","Circuits and systems","Sensor systems","Electronics packaging","Sensor arrays","Integrated circuit interconnections","Random access memory","Design engineering","Network-on-a-chip","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronics packaging","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional technology","architecture design","circuit design","sensor systems","processor-memory systems","network-on-chip designs","field-programmable gate arrays","package stacking","die stacking","wafer stacking","device stacking"]}],"abstract":"Package stacking, die stacking, wafer stacking, and device stacking are the four different types of three dimensional (3D) technology.

However, the hardware complexity and area of the decoder are largely increasing. In this paper, putting the code and decoder design together to consider, we propose a FPGA semi-parallel implementation of extended min-sum (EMS) decoding algorithm for quasi-cyclic low density parity check (QC-LDPC) codes over GF (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n).

The EMS decoding algorithm greatly reduces the computational complexity of processing units, check node unit (CNU). In addition, the updating calculation of the check node unit and variable node unit (VNU) can be overlapped to decrease the time latency and increase the throughput. Based on these architectures, the (486,972) QC-LDPC code over GF (4) decoder is implemented on Xilinx field programmable gate array (FPGA) Virtex4 XC4VLX160.

To improve the performance of telecommunication channels, digital baseband predistortion is employed to compensate for PA nonlinearities. But most existing architectures base on the memoryless PA model. For wideband signal transmission, PA memory effects can no longer be ignored and memoryless predistortion has poor performance. In this paper, a predistortion scheme based on the indirect learning architecture is proposed and analyzed with application to the wideband wireless transmitter. Then the performance of overall transmitter system is verified by simulation results.

perturbations by parasitic components. By exploiting the memristor characteristics, fine resolution programmable memristance is achieved by varying the amount of charges flowing or flux across the memristor. Under the same circuit configuration with same or even less amount of parasitics, memristance is reconfigured with fine resolution by controlling the input pulse width and its frequency. This paper shows an example of pulse programmed memristors and their analog circuit applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250376","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250376.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor-based fine resolution programmable resistance and its applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Memristor-based fine resolution programmable resistance and its applications","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5250376/","accessionNumber":"10879003","publicationDate":"July 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor-based fine resolution programmable resistance and its applications","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"090206948951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068656S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5250377,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

At the same time, the corresponding compensation algorithms are also showed. Finally, the paper gives the simulation results that the phase compensation to Doppler phase errors resulting from slant distance can improve the imaging resolution effectively.

The higher order (which means greater out-of-band attenuation) of receiving filter can not obviously improve the receiving performance. On the contrary it makes the receiver more complicated and more difficult to implement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5250525/","accessionNumber":"10879196","displayDocTitle":"The effects of mismatched roll-off factor on the receiving performance of QAM signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of mismatched roll-off factor on the receiving performance of QAM signals","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0110078690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112485S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5250528,"authors":[{"name":"Huanzhen Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Huanzhen Yang","id":"37674435800"},{"name":"Tingyong Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Tingyong Wu","id":"37831428300"},{"name":"Lidong Zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lidong Zhu","id":"37276567000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250528","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Detectors","Timing","Bandwidth","AWGN","Adaptive signal detection","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","demodulation","error statistics","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol rate offset effects","BER performance","QAM signal","noncooperative communication","blind estimation","symbol timing recovery loop","acquisition-aiding technique","capture symbol rate offset","out-of-lock detector","bit error rate performance","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","real-time demodulation loss"]}],"abstract":"In non-cooperative communication we need to estimate of symbol rate blindly.

In the paper, the symbol timing recovery loop using an acquisition-aiding technique (that is, adaptively adjusting loop bandwidth) can capture symbol rate offset of 1% with the help of the lock detector for 16 QAM signals. We analyze and simulate the effects for symbol rate offset of plusmn0.5% and plusmn1% on bit error rate (BER) performance over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The results show that under the same BER the real-time demodulation loss is less than 0.5 dB compared to the theoretical value. In addition, an out-of-lock detector is proposed. Together with the lock detector, the out-of-lock detector can ensure the symbol timing recovery loop provide good steady performance and relatively fast convergence rate by adaptively adjusting loop bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250528","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of symbol rate offset on the BER performance of 16QAM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effects of symbol rate offset on the BER performance of 16QAM signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250528/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879199","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5250528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of symbol rate offset on the BER performance of 16QAM signals","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0110119699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052919S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5250532,"authors":[{"name":"Yide Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Yide Zhang","id":"37867530900"},{"name":"Zhaorong Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhaorong Zhou","id":"37278616300"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Gang Feng","id":"37280823500"},{"name":"Lemin Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lemin Li","id":"37280693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250532","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"Radio resource allocation strategy is one of the key issues in wireless CDMA cellular networks, which not only has to ensure that the system guarantees potentially different QoS requirements from diverse applications, but also fully utilizes the scarce wireless resources. Meanwhile, in CDMA cellular networks, successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique can be employed to reduce multiple access interference and improve system capacity. The possible implementation of radio resource allocation strategies in CDMA cellular networks with SIC, such as Rate Allocation (RA) algorithm, has not yet been extensively investigated. In this paper, we address the issue of the Rate Allocation (RA) algorithm in a DS-CDMA system with the constraint of the received power on the base station. As the problem of rate allocation to maximize the total utilities is a NP problem in the system with variable rate services, we develop two suboptimal Greedy Rate Allocation algorithms, namely upward greedy algorithm (UPGA) and downward greedy algorithm (DNGR). These two greedy algorithms have very low computational complexities. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed RA algorithms have better system performance than other ones with other decoding orders.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250532.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel radio resource allocation strategy in CDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Greedy algorithms","Silicon carbide","Interference cancellation","Multiple access interference","Interference constraints","Base stations","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","computational complexity","greedy algorithms","interference suppression","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio resource allocation strategy","wireless CDMA cellular network","QoS","successive interference cancellation","multiple access interference reduction","rate allocation algorithm","NP problem","suboptimal greedy rate allocation algorithm","upward greedy algorithm","downward greedy algorithm","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel radio resource allocation strategy in CDMA cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5250532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879203","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel radio resource allocation strategy in CDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0110155963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055327S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5250533,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lin Zhang","id":"37087765637"},{"name":"Kaixin Lin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Kaixin Lin","id":"37087763702"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jiayin Qin","id":"37087211765"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250533","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250533","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Radio spectrum management","Optical signal processing","Space technology","Wireless communication","Cognitive radio","Wireless networks","Numerical analysis","Optical sensors","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","pricing","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supply function equilibrium pricing strategy","prioritized dynamic spectrum access network","spectrum usage","spectrum demand","supply function equilibrium game","spectrum management mechanism"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250533","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250533.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supply function equilibrium pricing strategy for primary user prioritized dynamic spectrum access","abstract":"In dynamic spectrum access network, primary users have the priority of spectrum usage and the spectrum demands by secondary users are time changing.

The two operation modes are automatic switched according to the equalizer output error level. Combined with step-size parameter variation online in each mode, the blind equalization solution can converge rapidly with low residual tap fluctuation noise. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques converge quickly and reduce the residue mean squared error (MSE) caused by the propagation channel to -40 dB. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm is practically implemented in the communication testing system. The measurement error of EVM is less than 2% for 6.4 MSps 256QAM in the 20 MHz real-time analysis bandwidth.

We considered three types of traffic, i.e. hard QoS, soft QoS and best effort (BE), the characteristics of which can be described by three different utility functions. We proposed a utility-based cross-layer resource scheduling model, which performs combinational-optimization adaptive resources allocation. At first, the scheduling model is formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem with the objective of maximization total utility, constrained to the CCI restriction and the quality-of-service requirement of QoS traffic. And then, it's transformed into a continue relaxing convex programming problem and solved. Based on the optimal relaxing solution, a low complexity dynamic subcarrier allocation algorithm, namely MHSU algorithm, is provided. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheduling algorithm guarantees a good performance of supporting heterogeneous services, and the system utility value obtained by MHSU algorithm is very close to the optimal value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity utility-based scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous services in OFDM Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250551","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250551.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity utility-based scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous services in OFDM Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5250551/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879038","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity utility-based scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous services in OFDM Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0108014852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054401S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5250552,"authors":[{"name":"Samer T.

Another challenge in CR networks is the spectrum handoff issue when the primary user (PU) appears in the spectrum band being used by the secondary user (SU). In this paper, unlike the existing spectrum handoff schemes suitable for fixed channel bandwidth, we introduce the concept of the delay bandwidth product (DBP) to prioritize the channels with variable bandwidths. The delay in the proposed DBP index is defined as the difference of the maximum tolerable delay of the SU and the average occupation time of the PU. Based on the DBP index for the variable bandwidth channels, the SU selects the optimal channel and bandwidth that can deliver the highest throughput and guarantee its QoS requirement. Compared with other existing spectrum handoff schemes, the proposed DBP-based spectrum handoff can achieve 100% to 200% higher throughput subject to the delay requirements for supporting voice and Web browsing services.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250552","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250552.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250552","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","startPage":"241","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-guaranteed channel selection scheme for cognitive radio networks with variable channel bandwidths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"QoS-guaranteed channel selection scheme for cognitive radio networks with variable channel bandwidths","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250552/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5250552/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879039","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-guaranteed channel selection scheme for cognitive radio networks with variable channel bandwidths","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"010901241245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089123S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5250553,"authors":[{"name":"Dah-Chung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Dah-Chung Chang","id":"37290177600"},{"name":"Yen-Heng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Heng Lai","id":"37576654200"},{"name":"Yung-Li Lai","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Li Lai","id":"37402844500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250553","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"An interleaved OFDMA system with a new carrier frequency offset (CFO) correction scheme is studied.

It is shown that the rate-optimized concatenated scheme over a fading channel may lead to a significant gain over the conventional design of non-binary LDPC codes and modulation diversity. And the rate optimized concatenated scheme can achieve 1.5 dB gains when bit error rate is equal to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n with low total rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250559","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","startPage":"116","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250559.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Concatenated codes","Parity check codes","Modulation coding","Fading","Constellation diagram","Mobile communication","Iterative methods","Laboratories","Iterative decoding","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","concatenated codes","diversity reception","fading channels","iterative decoding","modulation coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated nonbinary LDPC code","modulation diversity","rate match design","wireless communication system","iterative decoding","iterative detection","rate-optimized concatenated scheme","fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated non-binary LDPC codes with modulation diversity: Rate design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250559/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5250559/","accessionNumber":"10879046","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated non-binary LDPC codes with modulation diversity: Rate design","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA","sourcePdf":"010204116119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041061S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5250560,"authors":[{"name":"Huo Yong Qing","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Huo Yong Qing","id":"37087155105"},{"name":"Peng Qi Cong","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Peng Qi Cong","id":"37087156347"},{"name":"Mou Jiao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Mou Jiao","id":"37087154769"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250560","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Lagrangian functions","Bit error rate","Cost function","Data communication","Constellation diagram","Error probability","Computational complexity","Power distribution","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","communication complexity","error statistics","modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation algorithm","bit allocation algorithm","multicarrier modulation system","BER","bit error rate","Krongold algorithm","Alexander algorithm","computational complexity","maximization","channel allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250560","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250560.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient bit and power allocation algorithm for multi-carrier systems","abstract":"A bit and power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximizing the throughput given the total power and target bit error rate (BER).

Secondly, after efficiently analyzing primary user system channel-usage, a novel decoupled strategy for prolonging route lifetime and managing spectrum availably is designed. Simulation results show that, comparing to other typical approaches, our protocol provides longer routing lifetime to the dynamic spectrum environment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250568.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum-aware anti-intermittence routing in distributed Cognitive Radio Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5250568/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-aware anti-intermittence routing in distributed Cognitive Radio Network","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879054","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-aware anti-intermittence routing in distributed Cognitive Radio Network","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA","sourcePdf":"010402236240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056357S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5250569,"authors":[{"name":"Lilin Dan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Lilin Dan","id":"37409626600"},{"name":"Xu He","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Xu He","id":"37407012400"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Yue Xiao","id":"37556980400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Shaoqian Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"In this letter, a new blind partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme in multi carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems is proposed.

Therefore, we propose an iterative channel estimation method for OFDM/OQAM system to remove the residual ISI.

The beamforming using Grassmannian subspace packing (GSP) codebook is based on this view, which feedback the index of the codeword for a limited feedback. But if there is channel time-domain correlation, GSP scheme can not utilize the correlation. A scheme can utilize the correlation for subspace tracking: 1bit feedback scheme quantize the geodesic trajectory connecting two subspaces to reduce the feedback bits number. But the convergence speed of this scheme constraint the performance of 1 bit feedback scheme. So we propose a new beamforming algorithm, which extracts advantages of both schemes, reduces the feedback rate and enhances the system performance. Simulation results show that the new algorithm has a better performance than GSP scheme with the same feedback bits number, and solve the problem of the performance descend for 1bit feedback

investigates the problem of resource allocation in spatial multiuser access cognitive OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) systems. The objective is to maximize the cognitive users' weighted rate sum, which is constrained by the licensed users' (LU) interference temperatures. The spatial multiuser access using singular value decomposition (MU-SVD) model is introduced to the cognitive radio (CR) networks application to provide the multi-antenna gain and the spatial multiple access in frequency subchannels of diverse users. In addition, three schemes based on different receiver structures are used to solve the nonlinear and non convex problem. The results show that using spatial decorrelators can formulate the problem into a convex one and provide impressive throughput of the cognitive system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10879063","htmlLink":"/document/5250577/","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resource allocation of cognitive radio systems based on spatial multiuser access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resource allocation of cognitive radio systems based on spatial multiuser access","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA","sourcePdf":"0101076872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065361S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5250578,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Shu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Fang Shu","id":"37602698600"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Gang Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shao-qian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Shao-qian Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250578","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":487},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Radiofrequency interference","System performance","Transmitters","Diversity methods","Degradation","Educational technology","Base stations","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","feedback","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual codebook-based MU-MIMO","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output precoding scheme","scheduling scheme","limited feedback","downlink transmission","BS","base station","precoding matrix"]}],"abstract":"In this article, a novel dual codebook based multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) precoding and scheduling scheme with limited feedback for downlink transmission is proposed.

As a consequence of the time-varying channel, the orthogonality of subcarriers is destroyed, resulting in interchannel interference (ICI), which increases an irreducible error floor in proportion to the normalized Doppler frequency. In addition, due to the channel delays ranging in the guard period arbitrarily, an error floor of performance occurs by use of conventional integral-delay techniques. The important feature of the proposed technique is the ability to exploit the detective data for ICI mitigation and the estimation and update of channel parameters by use of estimating signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT). This enables us to achieve performance superior to the conventional structures without ICI mitigation or with integral-delays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative ICI cancellation and signal detection of OFDM system on fast time-varying channel with nonintegral-delay","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250579","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5230905/5250293/05250579.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5250579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative ICI cancellation and signal detection of OFDM system on fast time-varying channel with nonintegral-delay","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5250579/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879065","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative ICI cancellation and signal detection of OFDM system on fast time-varying channel with nonintegral-delay","confLoc":"Milpitas, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0101093237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066298S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5230905","isNumber":"5250293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5230905","xplore-issue":"5250293","articleId":"5250579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5250581,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Hongzhi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Hongzhi","id":"37681162900"},{"name":"Tang Youxi","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Tang Youxi","id":"37421290400"},{"name":"Gong Yi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Gong Yi","id":"38112518700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4886-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4888-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5250581","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Block codes","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Performance analysis","Decoding","Space technology","Fading","Wireless communication","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","correlation methods","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol error rate performance analysis","orthogonal space-time block code","keyhole MIMO channel","rank-efficient MIMO channel","exponential correlation model","constant correlation model","moment-generation-function"]}],"abstract":"Keyhole channels generally characterize rank-efficient MIMO channels, which were predicted theoretically and also observed experimentally.

Intuitive definitions of consciousness generally involve perception, emotions, attention, self-recognition, theory of mind, volition, etc. Due to this compositional definition of the term consciousness it is usually difficult to define both what is exactly a conscious being and how consciousness could be implemented in artificial machines. When we look into the most evolved biological examples of conscious beings, like great apes or humans, the vast complexity of observed cognitive interactions in conjunction with the lack of comprehensive understanding of low level neural mechanisms makes the reverse engineering task virtually unreachable. With the aim to effectively address the problem of modeling consciousness at a cognitive level, in this work we propose a concrete developmental path in which key stages in the progressive process of building conscious machines are identified and characterized. Furthermore, a method for calculating a quantitative measure of artificial consciousness is presented. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated with the comparative study of different software agents designed to compete in a first-person shooter video game.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive informatics","Humans","Reverse engineering","Biological system modeling","Concrete","Buildings","Application software","Software agents","Software design","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conscious machines development","cognitive informatics","artificial machines","reverse engineering","software agents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","cognitive science","intelligent robots"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5250668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGINF.2009.5250795","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 8th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234366/5250668/05250795.pdf","doi":"10.1109/COGINF.2009.5250795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Establishing a roadmap and metrics for conscious machines development","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Establishing a roadmap and metrics for conscious machines development","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10879232","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5250795/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5250795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Establishing a roadmap and metrics for conscious machines development","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102668S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234366","isNumber":"5250668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234366","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5250668","articleId":"5250795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5251188,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Rida","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/74/5251175/5251188/5251188-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amin Rida received his BS degree in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2006, and is currently working toward the PhD degree.

This is presented as a system-level solution for ultra-low-cost mass production of UHF radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes (WSN), in an approach that could be easily extended to other microwave and wireless applications. First, we discuss the benefits of using paper as a substrate for high-frequency applications, reporting its very good electrical/dielectric performance up to at least 1 GHz. The RF characteristics of the paper-based substrate are studied by using a microstrip-ring resonator, in order to characterize the dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent). We then give details about the inkjet-printing technology, including the characterization of the conductive ink, which consists of nano-silver particles. We highlight the importance of this technology as a fast and simple fabrication technique, especially on flexible organic (e.g., LCP) or paper-based substrates. A compact inkjet-printed UHF ldquopassive RFIDrdquo antenna, using the classic T-match approach and designed to match the IC's complex impedance, is presented as a demonstration prototype for this technology. In addition, we briefly touch upon the state-of-the-art area of fully-integrated wireless sensor modules on paper. We show the first-ever two-dimensional sensor integration with an RFID tag module on paper, as well as the possibility of a three-dimensional multilayer paper-based RF/microwave structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/5251175/05251188.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MAP.2009.5251188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5251188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5251175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5251188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conductive Inkjet-Printed Antennas on Flexible Low-Cost Paper-Based Substrates for RFID and WSN Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Wireless sensor networks","Dielectric substrates","Radio frequency","RFID tags","Microwave sensors","Dielectric losses","Dielectric constant","Mass production","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ink jet printing","microstrip antennas","multilayers","radiofrequency identification","UHF antennas","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip-ring resonator","3D multilayer","inkjet-printed antennas","radiofrequency identification","wireless sensor nodes","paper substrates","UHF antennas","printable electronics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RFID","ink jet printing","paper insulation","paper-based substrate","UHF antennas","microstrip antennas","printed antennas","low-cost RF modules","printable electronics","sensor integration","microsensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5251188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Conductive Inkjet-Printed Antennas on Flexible Low-Cost Paper-Based Substrates for RFID and WSN Applications","volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5251188/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10878863","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conductive Inkjet-Printed Antennas on Flexible Low-Cost Paper-Based Substrates for RFID and WSN Applications","sourcePdf":"0012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097871S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"5251175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"5251175","articleId":"5251188","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5251212,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Chandran","affiliation":["Dept.

indicator (SOCI) for the lithium poly carbon monoflouride (Li/CFx) battery has a wide range of applications. However, the dynamic environmental conditions, such as the ambient temperature, can alter the characteristic response of the battery and introduce non-linear behavior. This paper discusses the in-lab development of an artificial neural network (ANN) based SOCI for the Li/CFx battery. The ANN is trained on the recorded data - voltage, current and ambient temperature, to produce a non-linear model and to accurately predict the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. The SOC prediction is based on the recent behavior of the battery. Preliminary experimental results using recorded datasets from the battery design studio are presented for the lithium ion battery. The working model for the Li/CFx is currently under development. The reported results demonstrated good performance of the developed SOCI, with less than 2% average relative error on data at previously observed ambient temperatures.","doi":"10.1109/ISRCS.2009.5251344","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235873/5251339/05251344.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRCS.2009.5251344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5251339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent neural network implementation for SOCI development of Li/CFx batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5251344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent neural network implementation for SOCI development of Li/CFx batteries","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10879765","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5251344/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent neural network implementation for SOCI development of Li/CFx batteries","confLoc":"Idaho Falls, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"0057mf000078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06613S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235873","isNumber":"5251339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235873","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5251339","articleId":"5251344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5251357,"authors":[{"name":"Todd Vollmer","affiliation":["Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Vollmer","id":"37568521700"},{"name":"Milos Manic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Manic","id":"37277736800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4853-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4854-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5251357","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer networks","Neural networks","Intrusion detection","Control systems","Computer security","Laboratories","Ethernet networks","Knowledge based systems","Personnel","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","local area networks","neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection","cyber security state awareness","error backpropagation neural network","Ethernet network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Site security monitoring","command and control systems","neural networks","backpropagation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5251357","abstract":"An enhanced version of an algorithm to provide anomaly based intrusion detection alerts for cyber security state awareness is detailed.

In polymer nanocomposites, interfaces between fillers and polymer matrices are considered to play a predominant role because they have much larger interface areas than in microcomposites. The coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, based on the bead-spring model in polymer physics, is a powerful tool for interpreting the morphology and dynamics of polymer chains. In this study, a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation including a reaction model of monomers such as chief ingredients and hardener was conducted to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the interface between nano-fillers and thermosetting resins. Simulation results indicate that the dynamics of network chains close to the nano-filler surfaces is different from the bulk regions.

Much effort has been done to clarify it in physical essence. The space charge density and migrating velocity of space charge packet are of the two main parameters to characterize this phenomenon. The micro-structure could significantly influence charge trap density and trap level, which therefore influence the space charge migration. In this study, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) samples with various crystalline rate and gradient crystalline were prepared by hot pressing process with controlling cooling rate. The evolution of space charge packet in the LLDPE samples sandwiched by semiconducting electrodes under DC 40MV/m stress at 40degC was monitored by pressure wave propagation (PWP) method. The influence of crystallinity and micro-morphology on charge injecting rate, mobility and decaying procedure in LLDPE are discussed. The results show that the heating process history could significantly influence the dynamics of packet-like space charge.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 9th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235000/5252139/05252235.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"882","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 9th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","doi":"10.1109/ICPADM.2009.5252235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADM.2009.5252235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5252139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5252235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet-like space charge dynamics in polyethylene with various crystallinity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space charge","Polyethylene","Crystallization","Pressing","Temperature control","Process control","Cooling","Semiconductivity","Electrodes","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyethylene insulation","space charge"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-like space charge dynamics","polyethylene insulating material","space charge density","charge trap density","linear low density polyethylene","gradient crystalline","semiconducting electrodes","pressure wave propagation method","temperature 40 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polyethylene","space charge","cooling rate","crystallinity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5252235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Packet-like space charge dynamics in polyethylene with various crystallinity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5252235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10879487","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-like space charge dynamics in polyethylene with various crystallinity","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"I02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037184S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235000","isNumber":"5252139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235000","xplore-issue":"5252139","articleId":"5252235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5252459,"authors":[{"name":"Hormatollah Firoozi","affiliation":["High Voltage Laboratory of IRAN-TRANSFO Company, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hormatollah","lastName":"Firoozi","id":"37299927800"},{"name":"Mohammad Kharezi","affiliation":["High Voltage Laboratory of IRAN-TRANSFO Company, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Kharezi","id":"37299930200"},{"name":"Hasan Bakhshi","affiliation":["Abhar Islamic Azad University, Abhar, Zanjan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Bakhshi","id":"37586609800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4367-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4368-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-9225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-9241"}],"articleNumber":"5252459","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5252459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformers","Neural networks","Transfer functions","Circuit faults","Power transformer insulation","Artificial neural networks","Laboratories","Fault diagnosis","Frequency response","US Department of Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault diagnosis","neural nets","power transformers","reliability","transfer functions","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformers","fault localization","artificial neural network techniques","electrical networks","network reliability","fault diagnosis","transfer function","transformer winding","back-propagation learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turn-to-Turn Fault","Transfer Function Method","Neural Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPADM.2009.5252459","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235000/5252139/05252459.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 9th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 9th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5252139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADM.2009.5252459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn- to -turn fault localization of power transformers using neural network techniques","abstract":"Power transformers are considered as one of the essential elements in electrical networks. Any failure in these equipments directly reduces network reliability and increases maintenance costs. Therefore, quick and precise diagnosis of faults is very important. One of the main faults in this regards is turn-to-turn fault that its localization is very useful and vital. This paper has been presented a novel method for diagnosing and localizing of above mentioned faults in power transformers using both transfer function method and neural network technique. In this contribution some different turn-to-turn faults have been simulated on a laboratory HV winding of power transformer and correspond their transfer functions have been measured. Then, using an ANN with Back-Propagation learning algorithm, a method has been proposed to identify the local of occurred fault. Results show that the ANN could well diagnose the local of fault if it is trained using the presented patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5252459/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10879718","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5252459/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Turn- to -turn fault localization of power transformers using neural network techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn- to -turn fault localization of power transformers using neural network techniques","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"B11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047717S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235000","isNumber":"5252139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235000","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5252139","articleId":"5252459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5254115,"authors":[{"name":"Chihhsiong Shih","affiliation":["Tunghai University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chihhsiong","lastName":"Shih","id":"37290055200"},{"name":"Chien-Ting Wu","affiliation":["Tunghai University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ting","lastName":"Wu","id":"38104826700"},{"name":"Cheng-Yao Lin","affiliation":["Tunghai University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yao","lastName":"Lin","id":"38106014900"},{"name":"Pao-Ann Hsiung","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pao-Ann","lastName":"Hsiung","id":"37277259000"},{"name":"Nien-Lin Hsueh","affiliation":["Feng Chia University FCU, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nien-Lin","lastName":"Hsueh","id":"37270280500"},{"name":"Chih-Hung Chang","affiliation":["Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37308537000"},{"name":"Chorng-Shiuh Koong","affiliation":["National Taichung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chorng-Shiuh","lastName":"Koong","id":"37314044100"},{"name":"William C.

At the present days, a solution for above problems will be that to enhance the abstract level of multicore embedded software design. By leveraging on the expertise gained from Verifiable Embedded Real-Time Application Framework (VERTAF), we propose a Multi-Core version of VERTAF, called VERTAF/ Multi-core (VMC in short).

Given a set of input parameters where each parameter can take on one of a discrete set of values, a pairwise test set consists of a collection of vectors which captures all possible combinations of pairs of parameter values. The generation of minimal pairwise test sets has been shown to be an NP-complete problem and there have been several deterministic algorithms published. This paper presents the results of an investigation of generating pairwise test sets using a genetic algorithm. Compared with published results for deterministic pairwise test set generation algorithms, the genetic algorithm approach produced test sets which were comparable or better in terms of test set size in 39 out of 40 cases. However, the genetic algorithm approach required longer processing time than deterministic approaches in all cases. The results demonstrate that the generation of pairwise test sets using a genetic algorithm is possible, and suggest that the approach may be practical and useful in certain testing scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.91","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","publicationTitle":"2009 33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254161","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254044/5254161/05254203.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of Pairwise Test Sets Using a Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254203/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generation of Pairwise Test Sets Using a Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5254203/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10891012","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of Pairwise Test Sets Using a Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3726a626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076522S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254044","isNumber":"5254161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254044","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5254161","articleId":"5254203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5254211,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Wellein","affiliation":["Erlangen Regional Computing Center, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Wellein","id":"37394312000"},{"name":"Georg Hager","affiliation":["Erlangen Regional Computing Center, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Hager","id":"37401957300"},{"name":"Thomas Zeiser","affiliation":["Erlangen Regional Computing Center, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zeiser","id":"37572764000"},{"name":"Markus Wittmann","affiliation":["Erlangen Regional Computing Center, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Wittmann","id":"37404648500"},{"name":"Holger Fehske","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Fehske","id":"37546205300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3726-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"5254211","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"abstract":"We present a pipelined wavefront parallelization approach for stencil-based computations.

When designing and developing security solutions for SDR software, its performance requirements, such as stringent real-time constraint, need to be considered. In this paper, we describe a tamper resistance scheme that was designed to thwart the unauthorized tampering of SDR software. This scheme utilizes code encryption and branch functions to obfuscate the target program while enabling the program to satisfy its performance requirements. The scheme employs a technique called the Random Branch Function Call (RBFC), which enables a user to control the tradeoff between integrity checking frequency and the overhead. We have rigorously evaluated the scheme using various performance metrics and quantified the relationship between the end-to-end delay overhead (caused by the tamper resistance scheme) and voice quality in the context of a voice communication network.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.58","startPage":"383","endPage":"391","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254044/5254161/05254237.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tamper Resistance for Software Defined Radio Software","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tamper Resistance for Software Defined Radio Software","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5254237/","accessionNumber":"10891046","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254237/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tamper Resistance for Software Defined Radio Software","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"3726a383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091063S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254044","isNumber":"5254161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254044","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5254161","articleId":"5254237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5254313,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["Complex System and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900131200"},{"name":"Zhihua Cui","affiliation":["Complex System and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Cui","id":"37284922200"},{"name":"Jianchao Zeng","affiliation":["Complex System and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274478800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5254313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Decision making","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Cognition","Computational intelligence","Laboratories","Random number generation","Neural networks","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","group decision making","PSO","stochastic optimization algorithm","high dimensional function","premature convergence","GDPSO","fitness value","global best position","Pgj","population diversity","convergence speed","global searching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","premature convergence","group decision making"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254313","abstract":"The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic optimization algorithm imitating animal behavior, which shows a bad performance when optimizing the multimodal and high dimensional functions.

Two real-world mixed-varible optimization benchmark problems are presented to evaluate the performance of the FRPSO algorithm, and it is found to be highly competitive compared to other existing stochastic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2009.112","startPage":"543","endPage":"547","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254288/5254289/05254380.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2009.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization with Feasibility-Based Rules for Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Optimization methods","Constraint optimization","Stochastic processes","Switches","Hybrid intelligent systems","Chaos","Sun","Computational intelligence","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","feasibility-based rule","mixed-variable optimization problem","constraint handling","benchmark problem","stochastic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Feasibility-based rules","Mixed-variables"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization with Feasibility-Based Rules for Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5254380/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891179","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization with Feasibility-Based Rules for Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"3745a543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055994S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254288","isNumber":"5254289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254288","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5254289","articleId":"5254380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5254385,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Xiao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Process Industry Automation, Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Key Laboratory of Process Industry Automation, Northeastern University, Ministry of Education, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37395040600"},{"name":"Gang Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Ge","id":"38000437400"},{"name":"Jianhui Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Process Industry Automation, Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","Key Laboratory of Process Industry Automation, Northeastern University, Ministry of Education, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086901082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5254385","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"abstract":"Due to the problem that the noise in the noisy signal can not be predicted in many practical fields, we have proposed an adaptive filter based on wavelet transform method.

The model has applied the Hopfield neural network to implement the adaptive filtering algorithm LMS, so as to improve the computation speed.

First, the impact of the nonlinear characteristic on bit-error performance is analyzed using a commercially available LED (OSRAM, SFH 4230). Second, the paper proposes a predistorter to overcome the nonlinearities. Key features of the predistorter reside in the use of the LED inverse characteristics as nonlinear distortion compensator. A DC biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) system is considered and the performance without compensation and after compensation is analyzed via simulations in an AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) environment. In this context, the bit-error performance is determined for different bias points and power back-off values applied to the OFDM signal modulating the LED intensity. It is shown that LED nonlinearity can significantly degrade the performance. However, it is demonstrated that this degradation can greatly be mitigated by using the proposed predistortion technique.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2009.321","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254288/5254374/05254446.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2009.321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predistortion in Optical Wireless Transmission Using OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254446/","displayDocTitle":"Predistortion in Optical Wireless Transmission Using OFDM","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891243","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5254446/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predistortion in Optical Wireless Transmission Using OFDM","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"3745b184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075256S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254288","isNumber":"5254374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254288","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5254374","articleId":"5254446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5254538,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsin Cheng","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University of Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277349000"},{"name":"Guo-Jun Wen","affiliation":["The Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guo-Jun","lastName":"Wen","id":"37902973000"},{"name":"Ling-Cheng Hsu","affiliation":["The Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ling-Cheng","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37401778500"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["The Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5254538","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Detectors","Maximum likelihood detection","Paper technology","Hopfield neural networks","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational complexity","Chaotic communication","Neural networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Hopfield neural nets","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","telecommunication computing","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperbolic tangent HNN multiuser detection","DS-UWB system","Hopfield neural network","hyperbolic tangent activation","direct sequence-ultra-wideband system","maximum likelihood detection approximation","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum likelihood","Neural network","Hopfield and hyperbolic tangent"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes that the Hopfield neural network (HNN) with hyperbolic tangent activation is introduced and applied to multiuser detection in direct sequence-ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) systems.

Multiple access interference (MAI) causes the performance of the conventional single user detector in DS-UWB systems to degrade. Due to high complexity of the optimum multiuser detector, suboptimal multiuser detectors with less complexity and reasonable performance have received considerable attention. A hybrid approach that employs a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the MUD problem in UWB communication systems is proposed. By taking advantage of heuristic values and the collective intelligence of SAPSO, the proposed detector offers almost the same bit error rate (BER) performance as the full-search-based optimum multiuser detector does, while greatly reducing the computational complexity. The near-far resistance of the PSOSA-based multiuser detector is also examined. The good behavior of the proposed approach is demonstrated by means of comparisons in term of bit error rate (BER) performance and implementation complexity with the classical Rake receiver and different multiuser receivers previously proposed in the literature on this subject.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2009.282","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254288/5254522/05254593.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2009.282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Hybrid PSOSA-Based Multi-user Detection for DS-CDMA Ultra-WideBand Communications Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254593/","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Hybrid PSOSA-Based Multi-user Detection for DS-CDMA Ultra-WideBand Communications Systems","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891379","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5254593/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Hybrid PSOSA-Based Multi-user Detection for DS-CDMA Ultra-WideBand Communications Systems","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"3745c340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074135S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254288","isNumber":"5254522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254288","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5254522","articleId":"5254593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5254599,"authors":[{"name":"Sayan Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Sayan","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37710461000"},{"name":"Debarati Kundu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debarati","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37882674700"},{"name":"Kaushik Suresh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Suresh","id":"37868575600"},{"name":"Swagatam Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Swagatam","lastName":"Das","id":"38598899800"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"},{"name":"Bijaya K.

Because the method based on fuzzy neural network can reflect subjectively and correctly the different shapes of toe image, so the total automatic recognition rate amounts to 92.80%.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2009.300","startPage":"428","endPage":"432","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254288/5254522/05254611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Ninth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2009.300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Research on Footprint Recognition Method Based on Wavelet and Fuzzy Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Image edge detection","Image recognition","Shape","Neural networks","Image analysis","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Hybrid intelligent systems","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","fuzzy neural nets","shape recognition","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["footprint recognition method","wavelet neural network","fuzzy neural network","footprint image","edge detection","shape toe images","single judgment factors","comprehensive judgment vector","distance vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["footprint","toe shape","wavelet","fuzzy neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Research on Footprint Recognition Method Based on Wavelet and Fuzzy Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5254611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Research on Footprint Recognition Method Based on Wavelet and Fuzzy Neural Network","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"3745c428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046803S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5254288","isNumber":"5254522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5254288","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5254522","articleId":"5254611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5254664,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Kunze","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Kunze","id":"37271770600"},{"name":"Paul Lukowicz","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Passau, Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Lukowicz","id":"37275933300"},{"name":"Kurt Partridge","affiliation":["Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Partridge","id":"37352007800"},{"name":"Bo Begole","affiliation":["Palo Alto Research Center, Inc.orporated, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Begole","id":"37688276100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3779-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4816"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8541"}],"articleNumber":"5254664","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":876},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accelerometers","Legged locomotion","Gravity","Acceleration","Principal component analysis","Torso","Testing","Wearable computers","Embedded system","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["horizontal device orientation","accelerometer signal","mobile phone"]}],"abstract":"We present a method to infer the orientation of mobile device carried in a pocket from the acceleration signal acquired when the user is walking.

This approach ensures high memory and multiplier utilizations. The 64-point FFT is realized by decomposing into two-dimensional structure of 8-point FFTs. Each of this FFT is re-decomposed into 4-point and 2-point FFTs. This decomposition reduces the number of non-trivial twiddle factor into just one. Thus we only need one complex multiplier for the design. The complex multiplier is realized using modified Booth (radix-4) encoding algorithm to achieve faster computational speed. The validity and efficiency of the proposed circuit has been thoroughly verified by functional simulation, timing simulation, and FPGA implementation. The proposed design has been successfully synthesized using Synopsys with TSMC 0.18mu technology. The core area is 0.47 mm2. The power consumption is 29.7 mW. The time delay is 6 ns. The circuit computes one serial-to-serial data in 116 clock cycles. Thus our design has 3 advantages: small area, low power consumption, and fast computation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235860/5254684/05254734.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"64-point fast efficient FFT architecture using Radix-23 single path delay feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Feedback","Flexible printed circuits","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Energy consumption","Fast Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis","Encoding","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT architecture","Radix-23 single path delay feedback","fast Fourier transform circuit","complex multiplier","modified Booth encoding algorithm","FPGA implementation","Synopsys","TSMC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","R23SDF","radix-23"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"64-point fast efficient FFT architecture using Radix-23 single path delay feedback","isConference":true,"volume":"02","htmlLink":"/document/5254734/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10890696","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"64-point fast efficient FFT architecture using Radix-23 single path delay feedback","confLoc":"Bangi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"EE27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072942S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235860","isNumber":"5254684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235860","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5254684","articleId":"5254734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5254736,"authors":[{"name":"Trio Adiono","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Informatics School, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Trio","lastName":"Adiono","id":"37370695100"},{"name":"Randy Saut Purba","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Informatics School, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Randy Saut","lastName":"Purba","id":"38111685400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4913-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6822"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6830"}],"articleNumber":"5254736","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":868},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254736","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware design languages","Pipelines","Digital signal processing","Signal processing","Equations","Signal processing algorithms","Throughput","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinate rotation digital computer","CORDIC architecture design","field programmable gate arrays","digital signal processing","trigonometry","pipeline datapath architecture","hardware description language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","trigonometry","FPGA","RTL"]}],"abstract":"In Digital Signal Processing, trigonometry and complex multiplications are used in many signal equations, such as synchronization and equalization.

The investigated large power system is divided into five smaller areas depending on the coherency of the areas when subjected to disturbances. This is to reduce the amount of data sets collected for the respective areas. Transient stability of the power system is first determined based on the generator relative rotor angles obtained from time domain simulations carried out by considering three phase faults at different loading conditions. The data collected from the time domain simulations are then used as inputs to the PNN. An enhanced feature selection and extraction methods are then incorporated to reduce the input features to the PNN which is used as a classifier to determine whether the power system is stable or unstable. It can be concluded that the PNN with enhanced feature selection and extraction methods reduces the time taken to train the PNN without affecting the accuracy of the classification results.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254758","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235860/5254684/05254758.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"524","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient stability assessment of a large actual power system using probabilistic neural network with enhanced feature selection and extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transient stability assessment of a large actual power system using probabilistic neural network with enhanced feature selection and extraction","isConference":true,"volume":"02","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10890709","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5254758/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient stability assessment of a large actual power system using probabilistic neural network with enhanced feature selection and extraction","confLoc":"Bangi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"EE02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057621S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235860","isNumber":"5254684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235860","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5254684","articleId":"5254758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5254797,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Albared","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Albared","id":"38111109300"},{"name":"Nazlia Omar","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Technology, National University of Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nazlia","lastName":"Omar","id":"37547240800"},{"name":"Mohd.

Since proper analysis and interpretations of astronomical radio sources require a non-distorted image, and because filling all of sampling points in the UV-plane is an impossible task, image deconvolution has been one of central issues in the VLBI imaging. Up to now, the most widely used deconvolution algorithms are based on least-squares-optimization and maximum entropy method. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that is based on an emerging paradigm called compressive sensing (CS). Under the sparsity condition, CS capable to exactly reconstructs a signal or an image, using only a few number of random samples. We show that CS is well-suited with the VLBI imaging problem and demonstrate that the proposed method is capable to reconstruct a simulated image of radio galaxy from its incomplete visibility samples taken from elliptical trajectories in the uv-plane. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also demonstrated with an actual VLBI measured data of 3C459 asymmetric radio-galaxy observed by the VLA (very large array).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deconvolution of VLBI images based on compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254805","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235860/5254768/05254805.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI.2009.5254805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5254805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5254805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Deconvolution of VLBI images based on compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/5254805/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10890719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconvolution of VLBI images based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Bangi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"AI22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096225S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235860","isNumber":"5254768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235860","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5254768","articleId":"5254805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5254809,"authors":[{"name":"W M.

Traditionally, FL algorithms are implemented on general purpose processors; however design constraints are not met because of hardware limitations. The presented hardware implementation allows for the FL algorithm to be embedded in small products, coupled with a host processor. We define a configurable FL coprocessor architecture, where the architecture can be configured before compilation to reflect the behaviour as described in the model.

Many algorithms are proposed to resolve those problems. Discrete particle swarm algorithm (DPS) is a newly developed method to solve constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which has advantage on search capacity and can find more solutions. We proposed an improved DPS to solve TAP in this paper. DPS has a special operator namely coefficient multiplying speed, which is designed for CSP but does not exist in other discrete problems. Thus we redefined a coefficient multiplying speed operator with probability selection. We analyzed the speed and position updating formula then we derived a refined position updating formula. Several experiments are carried out to test our DPS. Experimental results show that our algorithm has more efficient search capacity, higher success rate, less running time and more robust.","doi":"10.1109/GRC.2009.5255030","startPage":"686","endPage":"690","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2009.5255030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5254998","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234367/5254998/05255030.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient discrete particle swarm algorithm for Task Assignment Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5255030/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient discrete particle swarm algorithm for Task Assignment Problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5255030/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10890594","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient discrete particle swarm algorithm for Task Assignment Problems","confLoc":"Nanchang, China","sourcePdf":"YangG419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076707S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234367","isNumber":"5254998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234367","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5254998","articleId":"5255030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5255076,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science & Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085466761"},{"name":"Guangjun Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science & Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Guangjun","lastName":"Xie","id":"37589283000"},{"name":"Tianhao Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science & Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tianhao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37672688500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4830-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5255076","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teleportation","Genetic algorithms","Quantum computing","Algorithm design and analysis","Logic gates","Physics","Circuit topology","Optimization methods","Circuit optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","network topology","teleportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum teleportation circuit","genetic algorithm","coding scheme","quantum gates","circuit topology information","fitness function","genetic operators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5255076","abstract":"This paper applies a standard genetic algorithm to the optimization of the quantum circuits.

Hence, efficient conversion algorithms and implementations are necessary. Existing conversion algorithms require several complicated operations, such as multiprecision multiplications and computations with large rationals, resulting in slow and large implementations in hardware and microcontrollers with limited instruction sets. Our algorithms are designed to utilize only simple operations, such as additions and shifts, which are easily implementable on practically all platforms.

Due to exponentially growing sequence databases, computing this operation at a large-scale is becoming expensive. An effective approach to speed up this operation is to integrate a very high number of processing elements in a single chip so that the massive scales of fine-grain parallelism inherent in several bioinformatics applications can be exploited efficiently. Network-on-chip (NoC) is a very efficient method to achieve such large-scale integration. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap between data generation and processing in bioinformatics applications by designing NoC architectures for the sequence alignment operation. Specifically, we 1) propose optimized NoC architectures for different sequence alignment algorithms that were originally designed for distributed memory parallel computers and 2) provide a thorough comparative evaluation of their respective performance and energy dissipation. While accelerators using other hardware architectures such as FPGA, general purpose graphics processing unit (GPU), and the cell broadband engine (CBE) have been previously designed for sequence alignment, the NoC paradigm enables integration of a much larger number of processing elements on a single chip and also offers a higher degree of flexibility in placing them along the die to suit the underlying algorithm.

A wear-leveling mechanism for moving data that are not updated is proposed to distribute wear-leveling actions over the entire physical address space, so that static or rarely updated data can be proactively moved and memory-space requirements can be minimized. The properties of the mechanism are then explored with various implementation considerations.

MAP queueing networks provide the first analytical methodology to describe and predict accurately the performance of complex systems operating under bursty workloads, such as multitier architectures or storage arrays. Burstiness is a feature that significantly degrades system performance and that cannot be captured explicitly by existing capacity planning models. MAP queueing networks address this limitation by describing computer systems as closed networks of servers whose service times are Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs), a class of Markov-modulated point processes that can model general distributions and burstiness. In this paper, we show that MAP queueing networks provide reliable performance predictions even if the service processes are bursty. We propose a methodology to solve MAP queueing networks by two state space transformations, which we call Linear Reduction (LR) and Quadratic Reduction (QR). These transformations dramatically decrease the number of states in the underlying Markov chain of the queueing network model. From these reduced state spaces, we obtain two classes of bounds on arbitrary performance indexes, e.g., throughput, response time, and utilizations. Numerical experiments show that LR and QR bounds achieve good accuracy. We also illustrate the high effectiveness of the LR and QR bounds in the performance analysis of a real multitier architecture subject to TPC-W workloads that are characterized as bursty. These results promote MAP queueing networks as a new class of robust capacity planning models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Computational modeling","Approximation methods","Queueing analysis","Servers","Capacity planning","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","operating systems (computers)","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven system capacity planning","workload burstiness","complex system","bursty workload","multitier architecture","storage arrays","computer system","Markovian arrival process","Markov-modulated point process","linear reduction bounds","quadratic reduction bounds","Markov chain","queueing network model","state space","robust capacity planning model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Performance of systems","computer systems organization","modeling and prediction","performance","operating systems","software/software engineering."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5341477/05255229.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5341477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven System Capacity Planning under Workload Burstiness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5255229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven System Capacity Planning under Workload Burstiness","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5255229/","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5255229/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10999464","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven System Capacity Planning under Workload Burstiness","sourcePdf":"ttc2010010066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109698S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5341477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5341477","articleId":"5255229","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5255230,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Sung Lee","affiliation":["Division of Computer and Communication Engineering, College of Information and Communications, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065105500"},{"name":"Kevin Skadron","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Skadron","id":"37273724700"},{"name":"Sung Woo Chung","affiliation":["Division of Computer and Communication Engineering, College of Information and Communications, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Woo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37404238500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5255230","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1397},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Radiation detectors","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","microprocessor chips","power aware computing","regression analysis","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive temperature-aware dynamic voltage scaling","predictive temperature-aware frequency scaling","performance counters","commercial microprocessors","regression analysis","software solution","Linux-based laptop","Intel Core2 Duo processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microprocessor","dynamic thermal management","thermal sensor","performance counter","DVFS."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose predictive temperature-aware dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) using the performance counters that are already embedded in commercial microprocessors.

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5530071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5530071/05255236.pdf","startPage":"1627","endPage":"1645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part-Based Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part-Based Models","volume":"32","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5255236/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11447170","pubMedId":"20634557","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5255236/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part-Based Models","sourcePdf":"ttp2010091627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166068S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5530071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"5884","xplore-issue":"5530071","articleId":"5255236","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5255685,"authors":[{"name":"Valdomiro Vega","affiliation":["USP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Valdomiro","lastName":"Vega"},{"name":"Nelson Kagan","affiliation":["USP, Brazil"],"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Kagan"},{"name":"Gabriel Ordonez","affiliation":["UIS, Colombia"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Ordonez"},{"name":"Cesar Duarte","affiliation":["UIS, Colombia"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Duarte"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-84919126-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0537-9989"}],"articleNumber":"5255685","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5255685","doi":"10.1049/cp.2009.1123","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234373/5255237/05255685.pdf","publicationTitle":"CIRED 2009 - 20th International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution - Part 1","displayPublicationTitle":"CIRED 2009 - 20th International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution - Part 1","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5255237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic power quality disturbance classification using wavelet, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"This paper considers two important classification algorithms for to classify several power quality disturbances.

Modern FPGAs narrow this gap by including \u201chard\u201d circuits such as memories and multipliers, which are very efficient when they are used. However, if these hard circuits are not used, they go wasted (including the very expensive programmable routing that surrounds the logic), and have a negative impact on logic density. In this paper, we present an architectural concept, called shadow clusters, which seeks to mitigate this loss. A shadow cluster is a standard FPGA logic \u201ccluster\u201d (typically consisting of a group of lookup tables and flip-flops) that is placed \u201cbehind\u201d every hard circuit, and can programmably, through simple, small multiplexers, replace the hard circuit in the event it is not needed. A shadow cluster is effective because the largest area cost, by far, in an FPGA is for the programmable routing that connects the logic. The shadow cluster area cost is small, and yet it enables more consistent employment of the programmable routing across applications with varying demand for hard circuits. We introduce new terminology to describe the economics of hard circuits on FGPAs, and provide a scientific way to measure the area effectiveness. We measure the area efficiency of FPGAs with and without shadow clusters, and show that a modern commercial architecture (with a fixed ratio of multipliers to soft logic) would gain 4.7% in area efficiency by employing shadow clusters. Indeed, every architecture we studied under \u201creasonable\u201d conditions never showed a loss of area efficiency. Furthermore, we show that most area-efficient architecture that employs the shadow cluster concept is 12.5% better than the most area-efficient architecture without shadow clusters.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2026651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5634429/05256139.pdf","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2026651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the Area Efficiency of FPGAs With Hard Circuits Using Shadow Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Area Efficiency of FPGAs With Hard Circuits Using Shadow Clusters","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256139/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11661438","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Area Efficiency of FPGAs With Hard Circuits Using Shadow Clusters","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pjamieson-2026651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110873S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5634429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5634429","articleId":"5256139","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256141,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Good","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Good","id":"37296807300"},{"name":"Mohammed Benaissa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Benaissa","id":"37271870100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5256141","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1180},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256141","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Application specific integrated circuits","Throughput","Energy consumption","Clocks","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","NIST","IP networks","HDTV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard","CMOS","average measured core power","core voltage","core area","power-latency-area performance","application-specific IC","ASIC","power 692 nW","size 0.13 mum","word length 8 bit","frequency 100 kHz","voltage 0.75 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced encryption standard (AES)","application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)","efficient design","low area","low power","low resource"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2025952","endPage":"1757","startPage":"1753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5634429/05256141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2025952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"692-nW Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) on a 0.13--m CMOS","abstract":"This paper presents a very low power/area design for the advanced encryption standard (AES) based on an 8-bit data path.

However, continuous technology scaling makes MLC NAND flash memories increasingly subject to worse raw storage reliability. This paper presents a memory fault tolerance design solution geared to MLC NAND flash memories. The basic idea is to concatenate trellis coded modulation (TCM) with an outer BCH code, which can greatly improve the error correction performance compared with the current design practice that uses BCH codes only. The key is that TCM can well leverage the multi-level storage characteristic to reduce the memory bit error rate and hence relieve the burden of outer BCH code, at no cost of extra redundant memory cells. The superior performance of such concatenated BCH-TCM coding systems for MLC NAND flash memories has been well demonstrated through computer simulations. A modified TCM demodulation approach is further proposed to improve the tolerance to static memory cell defects. We also address the associated practical implementation issues in case of using either single-page or multi-page programming strategy, and demonstrate the silicon implementation efficiency through application-specific integrated circuit design at 65 nm node.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2024154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2024154","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5584916/05256144.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Multi-Level NAND Flash Memory Storage Reliability Using Concatenated BCH-TCM Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving Multi-Level NAND Flash Memory Storage Reliability Using Concatenated BCH-TCM Coding","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11552551","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5256144/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Multi-Level NAND Flash Memory Storage Reliability Using Concatenated BCH-TCM Coding","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sli-2024154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139685S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5584916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5584916","articleId":"5256144","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5256145,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Ho Park","affiliation":["Brookman Technology, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5290333/5256145/5256145-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jong-Ho Park (M'08) was born in Daegu, Korea, in 1975.

The nonlinear equality constraint is first linearized and transformed into a state linear equality constraint with two uncertain quantities related to linearizing truncation error and base point error. S-procedure method is then applied to merge all inequalities into one inequality and the solution to the unconstrained set-membership filtering problem is provided. The set-membership filter with state constraint is finally derived from projecting the unconstrained set-membership filter onto the constrained surface by using Finsler's Lemma. A time-varying linear matrix inequality optimization based approach is proposed to design the set-membership filter with nonlinear equality constraint. A recursive algorithm is developed for computing the state estimate ellipsoid that guarantees to contain the true state. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed set-membership filtering with nonlinear equality constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5280579/05256147.pdf","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2029403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2029403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-Membership Filtering for Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Equality Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","State estimation","Linear matrix inequalities","Constraint optimization","Nonlinear filters","Ellipsoids","Target tracking","Stochastic systems","Stochastic resonance","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","filtering theory","linear matrix inequalities","optimisation","state estimation","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time systems","set-membership filtering","nonlinear equality constraints","state linear equality constraint","uncertain quantities","truncation error","base point error","S-procedure method","Finsler Lemma","time-varying linear matrix inequality optimization","state estimate ellipsoid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear equality constraint","state constraint","state estimate ellipsoid","set-membership filtering","time-varying linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization based approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Set-Membership Filtering for Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Equality Constraints","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5256147/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917884","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-Membership Filtering for Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Equality Constraints","sourcePdf":"54tac10-fyang-2029403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098903S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5280579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5280579","articleId":"5256147","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256151,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The radiation characteristics of the IWD in the human body models with changed and unchanged dielectric values are compared. Simulations are carried out at 13 scenarios where the IWD is placed at center positions of abdomens in the two models at the operation frequency of 430, 800, and 1200 MHz, respectively. Results show that variation of radiation intensity near the surface of abdomen is around 2.5, 2.6, and 3.5 dB within 20% variation of dielectric values corresponding to the frequency of 430, 800, and 1200 MHz, respectively. Electric fields in the anterior of the human body models are higher than those in the posterior for all scenarios. SAR values increase with the increase of conductivities of human body tissues, and usually decrease with the increase of relative permittivities of human body tissues. The effect of the dielectric values of human body on SAR is orientation-, human-body-, and frequency-dependent. A variation up to 20% in conductivities and relative permittivities alone or simultaneously always causes a SAR variation less than 10%, 20%, and 30% at the frequency of 430, 800, and 1200 MHz, respectively. As far as the compliance of safety was concerned, the IWD was safe to be used at the input power less than 12.6, 9.3, and 8.4 mW, according to the IEEE safety standards at the frequency of 430, 800, and 1200 MHz, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2029853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2029853","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5382610/05256151.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Dielectric Values of Human Body on Specific Absorption Rate Following 430, 800, and 1200 MHz RF Exposure to Ingestible Wireless Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Dielectric Values of Human Body on Specific Absorption Rate Following 430, 800, and 1200 MHz RF Exposure to Ingestible Wireless Device","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256151/","accessionNumber":"11070570","pubMedId":"19775981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256151/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Dielectric Values of Human Body on Specific Absorption Rate Following 430, 800, and 1200 MHz RF Exposure to Ingestible Wireless Device","sourcePdf":"titb-xu-2029853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077675S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5382610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5382610","articleId":"5256151","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5256154,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Ning","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5289971/5256154/5256154-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Ning received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K., in 1998 and the M.Phil. degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China, in 2004.","He is currently an Instructor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Accurate prediction of demand is a fundamental requirement and is also a great challenge to demand prediction models. This has motivated the research team to develop the minimum description length (MDL)-optimal neural network (NN) which can accurately predict retailer demands with various time lags. Moreover, a surrogate data method is proposed prior to the prediction to investigate the dynamical property (i.e., predictability) of various demand time series so as to avoid predicting random demands. In this paper, we validate the proposed ideas by a full factorial study combining its own decision rules. We describe improvements to prediction accuracy and propose a replenishment policy for a Hong Kong food wholesaler. This leads to a significant reduction in its operation costs and to an improvement in the level of retailer satisfaction.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2031433","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5289971/05256154.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"506","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2031433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5289971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fulfillment of Retailer Demand by Using the MDL-Optimal Neural Network Prediction and Decision Policy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fulfillment of Retailer Demand by Using the MDL-Optimal Neural Network Prediction and Decision Policy","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10957799","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5256154/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fulfillment of Retailer Demand by Using the MDL-Optimal Neural Network Prediction and Decision Policy","sourcePdf":"tii-zhao-2031433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106102S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5289971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5289971","articleId":"5256154","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5256161,"authors":[{"name":"Franck Dufrenois","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Analyse des Syst\u00e8mes du Littoral, Universit\u00e9 du Littoral, Calais, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5306478/5256161/5256161-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Franck Dufrenois received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from the University of Sciences and Technologies, Lille, France, in 1989, 1990, and 1994, respectively.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor at the Laboratoire d'Analyse des Syst\u00e8mes du Littoral, Universit\u00e9 du Littoral, Calais, France.

In this paper, we present a bounded influence SVR, which downweights the influence of outliers in all the regression variables. The proposed approach adopts an adaptive weighting strategy, which is based on both a robust adaptive scale estimator for large regression residuals and the statistic of a ldquokernelizedrdquo hat matrix for leverage point removal. Thus, our algorithm has the ability to accurately extract the dominant subset in corrupted data sets. Simulated linear and nonlinear data sets show the robustness of our algorithm against outliers. Last, chemical and astronomical data sets that exhibit severe outlier contamination are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in real situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5306478/05256161.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2024202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2024202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded Influence Support Vector Regression for Robust Single-Model Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Extraterrestrial measurements","Shape measurement","Contamination","Statistics","Data mining","Pollution measurement","Chemicals","Error analysis","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","matrix algebra","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bounded influence support vector regression","adaptive weighting strategy","robust adaptive scale estimator","kernelized hat matrix","robust single-model estimation","leverage point removal","simulated nonlinear data sets","simulated linear data sets","corrupted data sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive weight function","kernel hat matrix","outlier detection","support vector regression (SVR)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Linear Models","Models, Statistical","Nonlinear Dynamics","Normal Distribution","Regression Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bounded Influence Support Vector Regression for Robust Single-Model Estimation","volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5256161/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10950174","pubMedId":"19775962","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded Influence Support Vector Regression for Robust Single-Model Estimation","sourcePdf":"tnn-fdufrenois-2024202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118357S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5256161","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256162,"authors":[{"name":"Devis Tuia","affiliation":["Institute of Geomatics and Analysis of Risk, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5291960/5256162/5256162-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Devis Tuia (S'07) received the Diploma in geography from the University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2004 and the Master of Advanced Studies in environmental engineering from the Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, in 2005.

In this paper, we propose a general framework for designing topology inference algorithms based on additive metrics. The framework can flexibly fuse information from multiple measurements to achieve better estimation accuracy. We develop computationally efficient (polynomial-time) topology inference algorithms based on the framework. We prove that the probability of correct topology inference of our algorithms converges to one exponentially fast in the number of probing packets. In particular, for applications where nodes may join or leave frequently such as overlay network construction, application-layer multicast, and peer-to-peer file sharing/streaming, we propose a novel sequential topology inference algorithm that significantly reduces the probing overhead and can efficiently handle node dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference algorithms via Internet experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2022538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2022538","startPage":"123","endPage":"135","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5412147/05256167.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5412147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Dynamic Routing Topology Inference From End-to-End Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Dynamic Routing Topology Inference From End-to-End Measurements","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256167/","accessionNumber":"11137949","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256167/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Dynamic Routing Topology Inference From End-to-End Measurements","sourcePdf":"tnet-jni-2022538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109039S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5412147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5412147","articleId":"5256167","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5256170,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00c9dric Lardeux","affiliation":["Institut Francilien des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Marne la Vallee, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5332061/5256170/5256170-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9dric Lardeux was born in 1980.

Because of its ability to take numerous and heterogeneous parameters into account, such as the various polarimetric indicators under consideration, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used in the classification step. The contribution of the different polarimetric indicators is estimated through a greedy forward and backward method. Results have been assessed with AIRSAR polarimetric data polarimetric data acquired over a dense tropical environment. The results are compared to those obtained with the standard Wishart approach, for single frequency and multifrequency bands. It is shown that, when radar data do not satisfy the Wishart distribution, the SVM algorithm performs much better than the Wishart approach, when applied to an optimized set of polarimetric indicators.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5332061/05256170.pdf","startPage":"4143","endPage":"4152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2023908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2023908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machine for Multifrequency SAR Polarimetric Data Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Polarization","Radar scattering","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar polarimetry","Vegetation","Frequency","Backscatter","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar polarimetry","remote sensing by radar","support vector machines","synthetic aperture radar","vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","multifrequency SAR","polarimetric data classification","radar data","tropical vegetation cartography","support vector machine","SVM algorithm","backward method","AIRSAR","polarimetric data acquisition","standard Wishart approach","Wishart distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polarimetry","supervised classification","support vector machine (SVM)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","tropical vegetation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256170/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machine for Multifrequency SAR Polarimetric Data Classification","volume":"47","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5256170/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979201","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machine for Multifrequency SAR Polarimetric Data Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-frison-2023908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11327S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5332061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"5332061","articleId":"5256170","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5256175,"authors":[{"name":"Hyejung Kim","affiliation":["Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5382610/5256175/5256175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyejung Kim (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2004, 2006, and 2009, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Leuven, Belgium.

The aim of this study is to identify individual apnea and hypopnea events from normal breathing events using wavelet-based features of 5-s ECG signals (sampling rate = 250 Hz) and estimate the surrogate apnea index (AI)/hypopnea index (HI) (AHI). Total 82 535 ECG epochs (each of 5-s duration) from normal breathing during sleep, 1638 ECG epochs from 689 hypopnea events, and 3151 ECG epochs from 1862 apnea events were collected from 17 patients in the training set. Two-staged feedforward neural network model was trained using features from ECG signals with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation technique. At the first stage of classification, events (apnea and hypopnea) were classified from normal breathing events, and at the second stage, hypopneas were identified from apnea. Independent test was performed on 16 subjects' ECGs containing 483 hypopnea and 1352 apnea events. The cross-validation and independent test accuracies of apnea and hypopnea detection were found to be 94.84% and 76.82%, respectively, for training set, and 94.72% and 79.77%, respectively, for test set. The Bland-Altman plots showed unbiased estimations with standard deviations of plusmn 2.19, plusmn 2.16, and plusmn 3.64 events/h for AI, HI, and AHI, respectively. Results indicate the possibility of recognizing apnea/hypopnea events based on shorter segments of ECG signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Scoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea Events Using Short-Term Electrocardiogram Recordings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2031639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5300653/05256176.pdf","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2031639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Automated Scoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea Events Using Short-Term Electrocardiogram Recordings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5256176/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957723","pubMedId":"19775974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Scoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea Events Using Short-Term Electrocardiogram Recordings","sourcePdf":"titb-khandoker-2031639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216214S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5300653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5300653","articleId":"5256176","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5256178,"authors":[{"name":"Jie-Hua Zhao","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6104/5261115/5256178/5256178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie-Hua Zhao received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin.","He is a Member of Group of Technical Staff at Texas Instruments (TI), Dallas, TX.

The apparent mechanical strength of single-crystalline Si depends on process induced defects. Mechanical bending tests are the simplest way to obtain the strength of Si dies and wafers and have been used for many years throughout the industry. Some of the bending tests, such as the 3-point-bend (3PB) test, provide a convoluted contribution from both the defects on die surface (caused by backgrinding and mishandling) and defects on die edges (caused by sawing or dicing). However, the ball-on-ring (BOR) test provides a way to single out the contribution of backside grinding defects to the die strength. This paper compares the results of both 3PB and BOR tests on a number of backgrinding and dicing processes. The die strength of the 3PB test is consistently less than that of the BOR test due to the fact that the edge defects are under tension for 3PB tests but not for BOR. It is demonstrated that the BOR test is a good method for backgrinding process optimization. Due to the intrinsic scattering nature of the strength data, a Weibull-based probabilistic mechanics approach is the method of choice to present the data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256178/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10927033","volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Evaluations of the Strength of Silicon Die by 3-Point-Bend Versus Ball-on-Ring Tests","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Evaluations of the Strength of Silicon Die by 3-Point-Bend Versus Ball-on-Ring Tests","sourcePdf":"tepm-jzhao-2028329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056012S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5261115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5261115","articleId":"5256178","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5256180,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mansour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5312980/5256180/5256180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassan Mansour (S'99) received the B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2003 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2005, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree and pursuing research in the field of multimedia communication and video coding.","Mr. Mansour has been a member of the Standards Council of Canada committee on MPEG development (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29) since 2004."]},"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Mansour","id":"37411968700"},{"name":"Yaser Pourmohammadi Fallah","affiliation":["Institute of Transportation Studies (Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences), University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5312980/5256180/5256180-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yaser Pourmohammadi Fallah (S'97\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (electronics) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is pursuing research in the areas of networked cyber physical systems and wireless networking for intelligent transportation systems.","Dr. Fallah has been a member of the Standards Council of Canada committee on MPEG development (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29) since 2001.

We present a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes the operation of the link adaptation scheme in the physical layer (PHY), and that of a traffic control module in the network or medium access control (MAC) layer in multirate wireless networks, while satisfying bandwidth/capacity constraints. Multirate networks, such as IEEE 802.16 or IEEE 802.11, adjust the PHY coding and modulation schemes to maintain the reliability of transmission under varying channel conditions. Higher reliability is achieved at the cost of reduced PHY bit-rate which in turn necessitates a reduction in video stream bit-rates. The rate reduction for scalable video is implemented using a traffic control module. Conventional solutions operate unaware of the importance and loss tolerance of data and drop the higher layers of scalable video altogether. In this paper, we consider medium grain scalable (MGS) extension of H.264/AVC video and develop new rate and distortion models that characterize the coded bitstream. Performance evaluations show that our proposed framework results in significant gains over existing schemes in terms of average video PSNR that can reach 3 dB in some cases for different channel SNRs and different bandwidth budgets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","volume":"11","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"10975998","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256180/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for MGS H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over Link-Adaptive Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for MGS H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over Link-Adaptive Networks","sourcePdf":"11tmm08-hmansour-2032682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074214S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5312980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5312980","articleId":"5256180","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256181,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Qu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5306478/5256181/5256181-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Qu received the B.S. degree and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.","From July 2007 to February 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems Lab, School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.

The proposed neural network for robots is topologically organized with only local lateral connections among neurons. It works in dynamic environments and requires no prior knowledge of target or barrier movements. The target neuron fires first, and then the firing event spreads out, through the lateral connections among the neurons, like the propagation of a wave. Obstacles have no connections to their neighbors. Each neuron records its parent, that is, the neighbor that caused it to fire. The real-time optimal path is then the sequence of parents from the robot to the target. In a static case where the barriers and targets are stationary, this paper proves that the generated wave in the network spreads outward with travel times proportional to the linking strength among neurons. Thus, the generated path is always the global shortest path from the robot to the target. In addition, each neuron in the proposed model can propagate a firing event to its neighboring neuron without any comparing computations. The proposed model is applied to generate collision-free paths for a mobile robot to solve a maze-type problem, to circumvent concave U-shaped obstacles, and to track a moving target in an environment with varying obstacles. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Robot Path Planning Based on a Modified Pulse-Coupled Neural Network Model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2029858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5306478/05256181.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2029858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Robot Path Planning Based on a Modified Pulse-Coupled Neural Network Model","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5256181/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10942712","pubMedId":"19775961","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Robot Path Planning Based on a Modified Pulse-Coupled Neural Network Model","sourcePdf":"tnn-syang-2029858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126832S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5256181","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256182,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Sien Moo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5313577/5256182/5256182-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Sien Moo (M'98) was born in Pingtung, Taiwan, in 1953.

LED light sources find more applications than conventional light bulbs due to their compactness, lower heat dissipation, and real-time color-changing capability. Stabilizing the colors of red-green-blue (RGB) LED lights is a challenging task, which includes color light intensity control using switching-mode power converters, color point maintenance against LED junction temperature change, and limiting LED device temperature to prolong the LED lifetime. In this paper, we present a LED junction temperature measurement technique for a pulsewidth modulation diode forward current controlled RGB LED lighting system. The technique has been automated and can effectively stabilize the color without the need for using expensive feedback systems that involve light sensors. Performance in terms of chromaticity and luminance stability for a temperature-compensated RGB LED system will be presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","LED lamps","Light emitting diodes","Automatic control","Lighting control","Temperature control","Fluorescent lamps","Light sources","Switching converters","Pulse measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light emitting diodes","light sources","PWM power convertors","switched mode power supplies","temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature measurement technique","light output","RGB LED lamps","light-emitting-diode lights","light sources","color light intensity control","switching-mode power converters","color point maintenance","pulsewidth modulation diode","forward current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color maintenance","light-emitting-diode (LED) junction temperature measurement","light-emitting-diode (LED) lighting","red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB) LED","temperature compensation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2025983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5406264/05256196.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2025983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Measurement Technique for Stabilizing the Light Output of RGB LED Lamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Measurement Technique for Stabilizing the Light Output of RGB LED Lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256196/","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256196/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11136007","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Measurement Technique for Stabilizing the Light Output of RGB LED Lamps","sourcePdf":"tim-wong-2025983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041268S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5406264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5406264","articleId":"5256196","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5256198,"authors":[{"name":"Lifen Yuan","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","College of Physics and Information Sciences, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5406264/5256198/5256198-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lifen Yuan received the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Changsha Railway University, Changsha, China, in 1999, and the M.S. degree in circuit and system from Hunan University, Changsha, in 2003.

The proposed method extracts the original signals from the output terminals of the circuits under test (CUTs) by a data acquisition board and finds the kurtoses and entropies of the signals, which are used to measure the high-order statistics of the signals. The entropies and kurtoses are then fed to a neural network as inputs for further fault classification. The proposed method can detect and identify faulty components in an analog circuit by analyzing its output signal with high accuracy and is suitable for nonlinear circuits. Preprocessing based on the kurtosis and entropy of signals for the neural network classifier simplifies the network architecture, reduces the training time, and improves the performance of the network. The results from our examples showed that the trochoid of the entropies and kurtoses is unique when the faulty component's value varies from zero to infinity; thus, we can correctly identify the faulty components when the responses do not overlap. Applying this method for three linear and nonlinear circuits, the average accuracy of the achieved fault recognition is more than 99%, although there are some overlapping data when tolerance is considered. Moreover, all the trochoids converge to one point when the faulty component is open-circuited, and thus, the method can classify not only soft faults but also hard faults.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2025068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5406264/05256198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2025068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5406264","startPage":"586","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Neural-Network-Based Fault Diagnosis Approach for Analog Circuits by Using Kurtosis and Entropy as a Preprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Neural-Network-Based Fault Diagnosis Approach for Analog Circuits by Using Kurtosis and Entropy as a Preprocessor","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105471","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5256198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Neural-Network-Based Fault Diagnosis Approach for Analog Circuits by Using Kurtosis and Entropy as a Preprocessor","sourcePdf":"tim-he-2025068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106502S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5406264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5406264","articleId":"5256198","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256202,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxu Zhou","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5306478/5256202/5256202-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guoxu Zhou was born in Hubei Province, China, in 1977.

Actually, those constraints can be imposed uniformly by minimizing the condition number of diagonalizers. Motivated by this, the approximate joint diagonalization problem is reviewed as a multiobjective optimization problem for the first time. Based on this, a new algorithm for nonorthogonal joint diagonalization is developed. The new algorithm yields diagonalizers which not only minimize the diagonalization error but also have as small condition numbers as possible. Meanwhile, degenerate solutions are avoided strictly. Besides, the new algorithm imposes few restrictions on the target set of matrices to be diagonalized, which makes it widely applicable. Primary results on convergence are presented and we also show that, for exactly jointly diagonalizable sets, no local minima exist and the solutions are unique under mild conditions. Extensive numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the algorithm and provide comparison with other leading diagonalization methods. The practical use of our algorithm is shown for blind source separation (BSS) problems, especially when ill-conditioned mixing matrices are involved.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2030586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2030586","endPage":"1819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5306478/05256202.pdf","startPage":"1810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonorthogonal Approximate Joint Diagonalization With Well-Conditioned Diagonalizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256202/","displayDocTitle":"Nonorthogonal Approximate Joint Diagonalization With Well-Conditioned Diagonalizers","volume":"20","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"10942711","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","pubMedId":"19775960","htmlLink":"/document/5256202/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonorthogonal Approximate Joint Diagonalization With Well-Conditioned Diagonalizers","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhou-2030586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090244S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5306478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5306478","articleId":"5256202","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256209,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Amjadi","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Energy Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5256209/5256209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zahra Amjadi (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 from Azad University, Tehran, Iran, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from Concordia University, Montreal, Canada, where she has been working toward the Ph.D. degree, specializing in automotive power electronics, with the Power Electronics and Energy Research Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, since January 2008.","Her research interests include power-electronics-based energy management techniques for hybrid electric vehicle energy storage systems."]},"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Amjadi","id":"37393815700"},{"name":"Sheldon S.

In general, the design of an intelligent control strategy for coordinated power distribution is a critical issue for UC-supported PHEV power systems. Implementation of several control methods has been presented in the past, with the goal of improving battery life and overall vehicle efficiency. It is clear that the control objectives vary with respect to vehicle velocity, power demand, and state of charge of both the batteries and UCs. Hence, an optimal control strategy design is the most critical aspect of an all-electric/plug-in hybrid electric vehicle operational characteristic. Although much effort has been made to improve the life of PHEV energy storage systems (ESSs), including research on energy storage device chemistries, this paper, on the contrary, highlights the fact that the fundamental problem lies within the design of power-electronics-based energy-management converters and the development of smarter control algorithms. This paper initially discusses battery and UC characteristics and then goes on to provide a detailed comparison of various proposed control strategies and proposes the use of precise power electronic converter topologies. Finally, this paper summarizes the benefits of the various techniques and suggests the most viable solutions for on-board power management, more specific to PHEVs with multiple/hybrid ESSs.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2032195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05256209.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2032195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Electronics-Based Solutions for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Storage and Management Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256209/","displayDocTitle":"Power-Electronics-Based Solutions for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Storage and Management Systems","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054637","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256209/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Electronics-Based Solutions for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Storage and Management Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-williamson-2032195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086038S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5256209","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5256210,"authors":[{"name":"Hidenori Takahashi","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5401119/5256210/5256210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hidenori Takahashi (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronic engineering from the Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","During 2000, he was a member of Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) R&D Laboratories, Inc.

For this experiment, coherent polarization-division multiplexing--orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (PDM-OFDM) is used as a modulation format. PDM-OFDM uses training symbols for channel estimation. This makes OFDM easily scalable to higher level modulation formats as channel estimation is realized with training symbols that are independent of the constellation size. Furthermore, because of its well-defined spectrum OFDM requires only a small guard band between WDM channels. The dependence of the number of OFDM subcarriers is investigated with respect to the interchannel linear crosstalk. At a constant data rate the number of OFDM subcarriers is estimated to achieve lower linear crosstalk in order to achieve higher spectral efficiency. We then experimentally demonstrate dense WDM (DWDM) transmission with 7.0-b/s/Hz net spectral efficiency using 8 \u00d7 65.1-Gb/s coherent PDM-OFDM signals with 8-GHz WDM channel spacing utilizing 32-quadrature-amplitude-modulation subcarrier modulation. Successful transmission is achieved over 240 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) spans with hybrid erbium-doped fiber amplifiers/Raman amplification.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2032672","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5401119/05256210.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2032672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Spectrally Efficient DWDM Transmission at 7.0 b/s/Hz Using 8-65.1-Gb/s Coherent PDM-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256210/","displayDocTitle":"Highly Spectrally Efficient DWDM Transmission at 7.0 b/s/Hz Using 8<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex> </formula>65.1-Gb/s Coherent PDM-OFDM","volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11105594","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256210/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Spectrally Efficient DWDM Transmission at 7.0 b/s/Hz Using 8<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex> </formula>65.1-Gb/s Coherent PDM-OFDM","sourcePdf":"jlt-takahashi-2032672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07313S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5401119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5401119","articleId":"5256210","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256213,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Lezana","affiliation":["Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5483249/5256213/5256213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Lezana (S'06\u2013M'07) was born in Temuco, Chile, in 1977.

To overcome such limitations, spatial diversity based on MIMO techniques has been proposed for FSO systems. User cooperation diversity is a new form of spatial diversity which is introduced to overcome some limitations of MIMO structures. Although the promising effects of cooperative transmission in RF communications have greatly been considered so far, there have been a few notable research on cooperative diversity in FSO. In this paper, we first consider a 3-way FSO communication setup, in which the cooperative protocol can be applied to achieve the spatial diversity without much increase in hardware, compared to their regular transmission. Then, we introduce different cooperative strategies and investigate their bit error rate (BER) performance in the presence of shot noise, using the photon-count method. We compare the results with those of the direct path link (non-cooperative scheme) and the two transmitters case, which are the upper and lower bounds on the BER of the cooperative scheme, respectively. The results illustrate the advantages of cooperation under a number of different scenarios for realistic SNRs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256220/","volume":"27","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/5256220/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11002189","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BER Analysis of Cooperative Systems in Free-Space Optical Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Analysis of Cooperative Systems in Free-Space Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-mkarimi-2032789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05956S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5290263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5290263","articleId":"5256220","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5256235,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Redl","affiliation":["ELFI S.A., Farvagny-le-Petit, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5361389/5256235/5256235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Richard Redl (M\u201986\u2013SM\u201986\u2013F\u201908) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in radio transmitters from the Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary, in 1969 and 1973, respectively.","From 1969 to 1984, he was with the Technical University of Budapest, where he was engaged in teaching electronic circuits, and was involved in research of switching-mode power conversion and power amplification, and managed a variety of power supply projects for industrial and space applications.

Each pixel of the hyperspectral image is decomposed as a linear combination of pure endmember spectra following the linear mixing model. The estimation of the unknown endmember spectra is conducted in a unified manner by generating the posterior distribution of abundances and endmember parameters under a hierarchical Bayesian model. This model assumes conjugate prior distributions for these parameters, accounts for nonnegativity and full-additivity constraints, and exploits the fact that the endmember proportions lie on a lower dimensional simplex. A Gibbs sampler is proposed to overcome the complexity of evaluating the resulting posterior distribution. This sampler generates samples distributed according to the posterior distribution and estimates the unknown parameters using these generated samples. The accuracy of the joint Bayesian estimator is illustrated by simulations conducted on synthetic and real AVIRIS images.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05256272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","startPage":"4355","endPage":"4368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Bayesian Endmember Extraction and Linear Unmixing for Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Bayesian Endmember Extraction and Linear Unmixing for Hyperspectral Imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918062","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5256272/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Bayesian Endmember Extraction and Linear Unmixing for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-ndobigeon-2025797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134376S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5256272","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256279,"authors":[{"name":"Jingen Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5508665/5256279/5256279-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingen Ni received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2004.

However, similar to other fixed step-size adaptive filtering algorithms, the NSAF requires a tradeoff between fast convergence rate and low misadjustment. Recently, a set-membership NSAF (SM-NSAF) has been developed to address this problem. Nevertheless, in order to determine the error bound of the SM-NSAF, the power of the system noise should be known. In this paper, we propose a variable step-size matrix NSAF (VSSM-NSAF) from another point of view, i.e., recovering the powers of the subband system noises from those of the subband error signals of the adaptive filter, to further improve the performance of the NSAF. The VSSM-NSAF uses an effective system noise power estimate method, which can also be applied to the under-modeling scenario, and therefore need not know the powers of the subband system noises in advance. Besides, the steady-state mean-square behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, which theoretically proves that the VSSM-NSAF can obtain a low misadjustment. Simulation results show good performance of the new algorithm as compared to other members of the NSAF family.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5508665/05256279.pdf","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2032948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2032948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Variable Step-Size Matrix Normalized Subband Adaptive Filter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Convergence","Filtering algorithms","Noise cancellation","Echo cancellers","Gallium nitride","Acceleration","Steady-state","Algorithm design and analysis","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable step-size matrix normalized subband adaptive filter","convergence rate","normalized least-mean-square algorithm","NLMS algorithm","colored input signal","fixed step-size adaptive filtering","set-membership NSAF","subband system noise","subband error signal","system noise power estimate method","steady-state mean-square behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC)","normalized subband adaptive filter (NSAF)","system noise power estimate","under-modeling scenario","variable step-size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Variable Step-Size Matrix Normalized Subband Adaptive Filter","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5256279/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473546","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Variable Step-Size Matrix Normalized Subband Adaptive Filter","sourcePdf":"18tasl02-fli-2032948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061075S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5256279","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5256283,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan N.

In particular, portions of iris segmentation, template creation, and template matching are parallelized on an FPGA-based system, with a demonstrated speedup of 9.6, 324, and 19 times, respectively, when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based version. Furthermore, the parallel algorithm on our FPGA also greatly outperforms our calculated theoretical best Intel CPU design. Finally, on a state-of-the-art FPGA, we conclude that a full implementation of a very fast iris recognition algorithm is more than feasible, providing a potential small form-factor solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978395","htmlLink":"/document/5256283/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallelizing Iris Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelizing Iris Recognition","sourcePdf":"tifs-rakvic-2032012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086024S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5312766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5312766","articleId":"5256283","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256286,"authors":[{"name":"Diederik Verscheure","affiliation":["Optimization in Engineering Center (OPTEC), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5280579/5256286/5256286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Diederik Verscheure received the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the Katholieke Universiteit (K.U.)

The closed-loop system under the scaled function has robust transient performance to the variation of the amplitude of the target reference. Then, the parameters of the selected nonlinear function are tuned by optimal tuning methods. More specifically, the parameter-tuning problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently via numerical methods.

This is a challenging problem and closed-form solution with good localization accuracy has yet to be found. This paper proposes an estimator that can achieve this purpose. The proposed algorithm jointly estimates the unknown source and sensor positions to take the advantage that the TDOAs from different sources have the same sensor position displacements. The joint estimation is a highly nonlinear problem due to the coupling of source and sensor positions in the measurement equations. We introduce the novel idea of hypothesized source locations in the algorithm development to enable the formulation of psuedolinear equations, thereby leading to the establishment of closed-form solution for source location estimates. Besides the advantage of closed-form, the newly developed algorithm is shown analytically, under the condition that the TDOA measurement noise and the sensor position errors are sufficiently small, to reach the CRLB accuracy. For clarity, the localization of two disjoint sources is used in the algorithm development. The developed algorithm is then examined under the special case of a single source and extended to the more general case of more than two unknown sources. The theoretical developments are supported by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05256289.pdf","startPage":"4598","endPage":"4615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approximately Efficient TDOA Localization Algorithm in Closed-Form for Locating Multiple Disjoint Sources With Erroneous Sensor Positions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256289/","displayDocTitle":"An Approximately Efficient TDOA Localization Algorithm in Closed-Form for Locating Multiple Disjoint Sources With Erroneous Sensor Positions","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977251","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256289/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approximately Efficient TDOA Localization Algorithm in Closed-Form for Locating Multiple Disjoint Sources With Erroneous Sensor Positions","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-dho-2027765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101229S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5256289","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5256290,"authors":[{"name":"Hisaya Fujioka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisaya","lastName":"Fujioka","id":"37289904200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5256290","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":180,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":983},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256290","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Stochastic processes","Sufficient conditions","Batteries","Automatic control","Base stations","Broadcasting","Cyclic redundancy check","Energy management","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","control system analysis","discrete time systems","embedded systems","feedback","matrix algebra","perturbation techniques","robust control","sampled data systems","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time system","stability analysis","aperiodic sample-and-hold device","networked control system","embedded control system","sampled-data feedback control system","uncertain time-varying sampling interval","robust control","perturbation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix exponential","networked control systems","quadratic stability","sampled-data systems"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by the widespread use of networked and embedded control systems, an algorithm for stability analysis is proposed for sampled-data feedback control systems with uncertainly time-varying sampling intervals.

It is first shown that three well-spaced samples are sufficient to calculate the amplitude of a harmonic signal. However, the three-point estimator is sensitive to deviation of the sampling rate. To deal with errors that were caused by noncoherent sampling, a modified algorithm that uses two more samples is developed. With the five-point algorithm, estimation errors fall below 0.04% for 1% of frequency deviation. As a demonstration of its simplicity, the five-point estimator is applied to the signal conditioning of a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) using moderate-speed devices. By implementing the proposed algorithm with a low-cost 16-b microcontroller, a digital LVDT signal conditioner is built and tested with satisfactory performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5256302/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136004","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Five-Point Amplitude Estimation of Sinusoidal Signals: With Application to LVDT Signal Conditioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Five-Point Amplitude Estimation of Sinusoidal Signals: With Application to LVDT Signal Conditioning","sourcePdf":"tim-wu-2025072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5406264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5406264","articleId":"5256302","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5256305,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Hong Liu","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5280560/5256305/5256305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Hong Liu (S'04) was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1977.

The method analyzes the pressure signal at one side of the actuator in response to periodic step inputs to the control valve. It is shown that the detailed version of decomposed pressure signal, using discrete WT, establishes feature patterns that can effectively detect internal leakage and its severity. The proposed scheme requires a baseline (threshold) value, predetermined first by analyzing the pressure signal of a healthy actuator. Once the root mean square (rms) of the level-two detail coefficient values, obtained from the measured pressure signals in subsequent offline tests, fall below this baseline, a fault alarm is triggered. Furthermore, the degree of changes of the rms value from the one obtained under normal operating condition indicates the severity of fault. Experimental tests show promising results for detecting internal leakages as low as 0.124 L/min, representing approximately 2.6% reduction of flow rate available to move the actuator. This is done without a need to model the actuator or leakage. Other methods of leakage fault diagnosis require the model of the actuator or leakage fault. Furthermore, no other method reported the internal leakage detection of magnitude as low as the one reported in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","volume":"57","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"11228990","publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256314/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Wavelet-Based Approach to Internal Seal Damage Diagnosis in Hydraulic Actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wavelet-Based Approach to Internal Seal Damage Diagnosis in Hydraulic Actuators","sourcePdf":"tie-sepehri-2032198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07692S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5446457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5446457","articleId":"5256314","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5256318,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxian Yang","affiliation":["New and Renewable Energy Centre, Blyth, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5256318/5256318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenxian Yang received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1999.

Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from direct- or indirect-drive fixed- or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective Condition Monitoring for Wind Turbines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2032202","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05256318.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2032202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Condition Monitoring for Wind Turbines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5256318/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019858","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Condition Monitoring for Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tie-yang-2032202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060146S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5256318","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256319,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Caro","affiliation":["University of Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Caro","id":"37405205900"},{"name":"Antonio J.

Every robustness constraint is shown to be equivalent to a min-max optimization task formed by means of the robust statistics epsiv -insensitive loss function. Such a multiplicity of specifications turns out to obtain a simple expression by using the rich frame of fixed-point sets of certain mappings defined in a Hilbert space. Moreover, the cost function, that the final solution has to optimize, is expressed as an infinite sequence of convex, nondifferentiable loss functions, springing from the sequence of the incoming training data. A novel adaptive beamforming design, of linear complexity with respect to the number of unknown parameters, to such a constrained nonlinear learning problem is derived by employing a very recently developed version of the adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM). The method produces a sequence that, under mild conditions, exhibits properties like the strong convergence to a beamformer that satisfies all of the imposed constraints, and in the meantime asymptotically minimizes the sequence of the loss functions imposed by the training data. The numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method displays increased resolution in cases where the classical linear beamforming solutions collapse. Moreover, it leads to solutions, which are in agreement with the imposed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge, as opposed to unconstrained online kernel regression techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Constrained Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Robust Beamforming Case","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027771","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05256321.pdf","startPage":"4744","endPage":"4764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Constrained Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Robust Beamforming Case","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5256321/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977237","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Constrained Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Robust Beamforming Case","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-kslavakis-2027771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167799S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5256321","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256322,"authors":[{"name":"Oleg Kuybeda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Kuybeda","id":"37660772000"},{"name":"David Malah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Malah","id":"37277677800"},{"name":"Meir Barzohar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Meir","lastName":"Barzohar","id":"37277675100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5256322","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of redundancy reduction of high-dimensional noisy signals that may contain anomaly (rare) vectors, which we wish to preserve.

We utilize a hierarchical form of the Laplace prior to model the sparsity of the unknown signal. We describe the relationship among a number of sparsity priors proposed in the literature, and show the advantages of the proposed model including its high degree of sparsity. Moreover, we show that some of the existing models are special cases of the proposed model. Using our model, we develop a constructive (greedy) algorithm designed for fast reconstruction useful in practical settings. Unlike most existing CS reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm is fully automated, i.e., the unknown signal coefficients and all necessary parameters are estimated solely from the observation, and, therefore, no user-intervention is needed. Additionally, the proposed algorithm provides estimates of the uncertainty of the reconstructions. We provide experimental results with synthetic 1-D signals and images, and compare with the state-of-the-art CS reconstruction algorithms demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2032894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5353839/05256324.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2032894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Laplace Priors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Laplace Priors","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11020080","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","pubMedId":"19775966","htmlLink":"/document/5256324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Laplace Priors","sourcePdf":"tip-babacan-2032894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097495S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5353839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"428","xplore-issue":"5353839","articleId":"5256324","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256332,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Tomazeli Duarte","affiliation":["Gipsa-lab (UMR CNRS 5216), Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Leonardo Tomazeli","lastName":"Duarte","id":"37565745800"},{"name":"Bertrand Rivet","affiliation":["Gipsa-lab (UMR CNRS 5216), Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Rivet","id":"37413753300"},{"name":"Christian Jutten","affiliation":["Gipsa-lab (UMR CNRS 5216), Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France","Institut Universitaire de France, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Jutten","id":"37284647800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5256332","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Covariance matrix","Source separation","Independent component analysis","Baseband","Frequency domain analysis","Bandwidth","Hydrogen","Principal component analysis","Blind source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation method","second-order frequency identification algorithm","frequency domain","eigenstructure","covariance matrix","baseband signal retrieval","blind extraction","smooth signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","frequency-domain approach","silent bands","smooth signals","source extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256332","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2032983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","abstract":"We propose a novel blind source separation method tailored for retrieving baseband signals having different bandwidths.

Traditionally, when all cells of an SRAM block used to have almost the same delay, within-die variations are increasingly widening the delay distribution of cells even within a single SRAM block, and hence, most of these cells are substantially faster than the delay set for the entire block. Consequently, after the reverse body biasing and the resulting delay rise, only a small number of cells violate the original delay of the SRAM block; we propose to replace them with sufficient number of spare rows/columns of SRAM. Our experiments show that the leakage can be reduced by up to 40% in a 90-nm predictive technology by adding less than ten spare columns to an 8-kB SRAM array for a negligible penalty in delay, dynamic power, and area in the presence of 3% uncorrelated random delay variation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5634429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5634429/05256337.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2026048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2026048","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM Leakage Reduction by Row/Column Redundancy Under Random Within-Die Delay Variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256337/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM Leakage Reduction by Row/Column Redundancy Under Random Within-Die Delay Variation","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256337/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11661441","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM Leakage Reduction by Row/Column Redundancy Under Random Within-Die Delay Variation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-goudarzi-2026048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108998S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5634429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5634429","articleId":"5256337","onlineDate":"22 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5256358,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas R.

The article identifies the performance drawbacks of TSBS such as low bearing capacity and the conflict between bearing force and torque generation. These drawbacks are controlled by including a control scheme in the TSBS model that balances the load between two radial axes. A saturation constraint on the control input is established, that drives the rotational subsystem which preserves the stability of overall system. Several experiments are being performed to realize and validate the control design of TSBS.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomotors","Synchronous motors","Magnetic levitation","Rotors","Permanent magnet motors","Lorentz covariance","Costs","Torque","Shafts","Force control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","electric motors","machine control","magnetic levitation","servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-bearing motors","bearingless motor","electric motor","tooth-less self-bearing servomotor","performance drawbacks","low bearing capacity","bearing force","torque generation","radial axes","control input","rotational subsystem","overall system stability","Lorentz force magnetic levitation","control design","active load balancing"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/5256264/05256358.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2009.933488","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2009.933488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of a self-bearing servomotor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256358/","displayDocTitle":"Control of a self-bearing servomotor","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880642","htmlLink":"/document/5256358/","volume":"29","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of a self-bearing servomotor","sourcePdf":"21-29mcs05-grochmal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078799S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5488303","isNumber":"5256264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5256264","articleId":"5256358","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5256665,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.

Characteristics of MANETs are thus a lack of central coordination, the mobility of hosts and a dynamically varying network topology. A multi-hop wireless ad hoc network is considered, where all nodes share a common channel and code division multiple access (CDMA) is used to facilitate concurrent transmissions. The network model consists of groups of nodes, termed as clusters. We address the question of how to efficiently facilitate intra-cluster and inter-cluster communications between multiple source-destination pairs. The influence of a change in cluster topology is also considered, and we study the effect of the node mobility in ad hoc networks. The used performance metrics is throughput per unit power. The concurrent transmissions employ distributed power control and are scheduled to resolve conflicts. A dynamic forwarding mechanism is used, in which forwarding nodes are used when it is energy efficient, and the choice of forwarding node varies according to source destination pairs. We compare the fixed topology and the varying topology for two example clusters. We also study the effect of node mobility by move one node in each cluster in two moving methods: random walk, and move in area node.","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.2009.5256710","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5235870/5256625/05256710.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.2009.5256710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of varying topology and nodes mobility for clustered CDMA wireless ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256710/","displayDocTitle":"Study of varying topology and nodes mobility for clustered CDMA wireless ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10890789","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256710/","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of varying topology and nodes mobility for clustered CDMA wireless ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Ouarzazate, Morocco","sourcePdf":"PaperFR106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137775S","chronDate":"2-4 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5235870","isNumber":"5256625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5235870","xplore-issue":"5256625","articleId":"5256710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5256712,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The implementation complexity of the scheme is linear in the number of users and operates on the fact that parallel processing simultaneously removes from each user a part of the interference produced by the remaining users accessing the channel the amount being proportional to their reliability. The parallel processing can be done in multiple stages. The proposed scheme uses an hybrid interference cancellation combining the advantages of these two schemes: parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The hybrid scheme (S-PIC) is faster, reliable and it reduces the computational load.

The sources of energy are defined by specifying the electric potential of all conductive spheres; these potentials are obtained from the vertical electric field profile proposed by Gish.

As a further intention of this paper, the basic reasons for the limitation of the tuning range in millimeter-wave VCOs are shown and the improvement by using two (instead of one) varactor pairs is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2026822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5256964/05256966.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2026822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256964","startPage":"2655","endPage":"2662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SiGe Bipolar VCO With Ultra-Wide Tuning Range at 80 GHz Center Frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5256966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SiGe Bipolar VCO With Ultra-Wide Tuning Range at 80 GHz Center Frequency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880515","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5256966/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SiGe Bipolar VCO With Ultra-Wide Tuning Range at 80 GHz Center Frequency","sourcePdf":"44jssc10-npohl-2026822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093519S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5256964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5256964","articleId":"5256966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5256967,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyue Wang","affiliation":["University of California, Davis, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5256964/5256967/5256967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haoyue Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Peking University, China, the M.S. degree from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Davis, in 2008.","His research interests include analog and mixed-signal circuit design and digital signal processing."]},"firstName":"Haoyue","lastName":"Wang","id":"38107216300"},{"name":"Xiaoyue Wang","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5256964/5256967/5256967-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyue Wang (S'99\u2013M'04) was born in Yunnan, China, in 1972.

The nested architecture calibrates the pipelined ADC with an algorithmic ADC that is also calibrated. Without an input SHA, a timing difference between the sampling instants of the two ADCs creates an error that interferes with calibration of the pipelined ADC. This problem is overcome with digital background timing compensation. It uses a differentiator with fixed coefficients to build an adaptive interpolator. With a 58-kHz sinusoidal input, the 12-bit 20-Msample/s pipelined ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 70.2 dB, a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 80.3 dB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of 0.75 least significant bit (LSB).

The industry standard bonding wires are exploited to provide high efficiency and low-cost antennas.

The system uses binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation to keep the design compact and power efficient. The transmitter includes a differential to single-ended modulator and a two-stage power amplifier (PA). The receiver includes a low-noise amplifier (LNA), pre-amplifiers, envelope detectors (ED), a variable gain amplifier (VGA), and a comparator. The chip is fabricated in 180-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. With power-efficient transceivers and low-cost high-performance antennas, the implemented inter-chip link achieves bit-error rate (BER) around 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-8</sup>\n for 6 Gb/s over a distance of 2 cm. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recovered signal is about 24 dB with 18 ps of rms jitter. The transmitter and receiver consume 57 mW and 60 mW, respectively, including buffers.

These applications require wide dynamic range (WDR), high linearity and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which cannot be met simultaneously by existing CMOS imaging sensors. This paper introduces a new activity-triggered WDR CMOS imaging sensor with very low distortion. The new WDR pixel includes self-resetting circuits to partially quantize the photocurrent in the pixel. The pixel residual analog voltage is further quantized by a low-resolution column-wise ADC. The ADC code and the partially quantized pixel codes are processed by column-wise digital circuits to form WDR images. Calibration circuits are included in the pixel to improve the pixel linearity by a digital calibration method, which requires low calibration overhead. Current-mode difference circuits are included in the pixel to detect activities within the scene so that the imaging sensor captures high quality images only for scenes with intense activity. A proof-of-concept 32 times 32 imaging sensor is fabricated in a 0.35 mum CMOS process. The fill factor of the new pixel is 27%. Silicon measurements show that the new imaging sensor can achieve 95.3 dB dynamic range with low distortion of -75.6 dB after calibration. The maximum SNR of the sensor is 74.5 dB. The imaging sensor runs at frame rate up to 15 Hz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5256974/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10880520","volume":"44","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Activity-Triggered 95.3 dB DR <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-$</tex></formula>75.6 dB THD CMOS Imaging Sensor With Digital Calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Activity-Triggered 95.3 dB DR <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-$</tex></formula>75.6 dB THD CMOS Imaging Sensor With Digital Calibration","sourcePdf":"44jssc10-jyuan-2027929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121771S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5256964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5256964","articleId":"5256974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5256975,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin W.

A wideband envelope amplifier provides dynamic collector supply biasing to the RF stage. A digital pre-distortion technique is employed to satisfy the linearity specifications of WCDMA. The measured overall power-added efficiency reached 58% with a normalized root-mean-square (RMS) error of 2.9% and an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of -49\u00a0dBc at 5-MHz offset at an average output power of 42 W and a gain of 10.3 dB for a single carrier WCDMA signal with 6.6-dB peak-to-average power ratio. A memory mitigation algorithm further improves the linearity, resulting in an ACLR of -70 dBc and a normalized RMS error of 0.3%. Measurements were made to quantify separately the efficiency contributions of the HVHBT-based RF stage, and of the envelope amplifier. The measurements show that the RF stage operates at collector efficiency above 85% over most of the instantaneous power range of the WCDMA signal. This remarkably high efficiency is the result of low ldquoon-resistancerdquo and low (and nearly voltage independent) output capacitance of the HVHBT.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2026845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5256964/05256978.pdf","startPage":"2629","endPage":"2639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2026845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency WCDMA Envelope Tracking Base-Station Amplifier Implemented <newline/>With GaAs HVHBTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5256978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency WCDMA Envelope Tracking Base-Station Amplifier Implemented <newline/>With GaAs HVHBTs","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5256978/","accessionNumber":"10880524","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency WCDMA Envelope Tracking Base-Station Amplifier Implemented <newline/>With GaAs HVHBTs","sourcePdf":"44jssc10-jjeong-2026845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095166S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5256964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5256964","articleId":"5256978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5256979,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5256964/5256979/5256979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongwoo Lee (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Seoul Nation University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","Prior to beginning his graduate studies, he was an operation/research officer (1st LT) at the Ministry of Nation Defense in Korea for two and half years.

Passive elements play an important role in PA design, as they determine both the output power and power gain of the circuit. In this work, we have developed a methodology for design of transformer-coupled power amplifiers. A distributed model of on-chip transformers has been developed that can predict the performance up to very high frequencies, is length scalable and uses only a few parameters , compared to a complete lumped model. Using the model, a two-stage transformer-coupled PA has been designed in 90 nm CMOS. The prototype has one of the highest output powers reported for a 60 GHz CMOS PA. A three-stage improved design with higher gain and efficiency is reported, stressing the importance of driver stage design at these frequencies.

In this paper, we propose models for these processes and discuss ongoing progress in 2-D experimental waveform retrieval that will be used to validate the models.

Simulation results show that significant performance improvements in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) can be achieved, especially when iterative decoding/detection algorithms are implemented, whereby soft extrinsic messages are exchanged between the belief-propagation-based decoder for the nonbinary LDPC code and the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR)-based detector for the patterned media storage channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Correction Coding With LDPC Codes for Patterned Media Storage","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257016.pdf","startPage":"3745","endPage":"3748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Error Correction Coding With LDPC Codes for Patterned Media Storage","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257016/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879918","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Correction Coding With LDPC Codes for Patterned Media Storage","sourcePdf":"45tmag10-xliu-2022333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042862S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5257018,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Miura","affiliation":["RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Miura","id":"37270833900"},{"name":"Eiji Yamamoto","affiliation":["RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37273717100"},{"name":"Hajime Aoi","affiliation":["RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Aoi","id":"37266430600"},{"name":"Hiroaki Muraoka","affiliation":["RIEC, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Muraoka","id":"37275122300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5257018","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Writing","Magnetic heads","Magnetic recording","Tin","Crosstalk","Signal to noise ratio","Perpendicular magnetic recording","Density measurement","Design optimization","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic heads","magnetic recording noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum track density","narrow track pitch shingled writing","two-dimensional magnetic recording","high track density","magnetic heads","magnetic recording media","squeezing model","SN ratio","write-to-write misregistration","signal-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["747 curve","off track capability","shingled writing","squeezed track","two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the feasibility of two-dimensional magnetic recording is discussed from the viewpoint of high track density. 747 curves of shingled track were measured using existing heads and media and were interpreted with a squeezing model dominated by the SN ratio of the read head output.

However, since the airgap field is produced by the stator-magnets alone, it is difficult to be regulated. Hence, a hybrid excitation method, i.e., by introducing a set of field windings into FSPM motor is employed. In this paper, a novel hybrid excitation flux-switching (HEFS) motor is proposed, in which the airgap field can be easily controlled and is favorable for hybrid vehicles. The preliminary topology, operation principle, design and static characteristics including phase flux-linkage, back-EMF waveforms under different excitations as well as cogging torque are evaluated based on finite element (FE) analysis. The results confirm the excellent field-regulation capability of a ldquoproof-of-principlerdquo HEFS motor.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257019.pdf","startPage":"4728","endPage":"4731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Excitation Flux-Switching Motor for Hybrid Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257019/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Excitation Flux-Switching Motor for Hybrid Vehicles","volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879921","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5257019/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Excitation Flux-Switching Motor for Hybrid Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tmag-whua-2022497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080416S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5257022,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Ho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Ho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404038300"},{"name":"Kwang-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang-Soo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406164900"},{"name":"Seung-Joo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Joo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37984781700"},{"name":"Dong-Woo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Woo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37630007900"},{"name":"Sung-Chul Go","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Chul","lastName":"Go","id":"37297148600"},{"name":"Yon-Do Chun","affiliation":["Electric Motor Research Group, Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, Changwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yon-Do","lastName":"Chun","id":"37303854700"},{"name":"J.

The outer speed loop in vector controlled PMSM drive greatly affects the drive performance. In order to combine the advantages of proportional plus integral (PI) and fuzzy controllers, hybrid fuzzy-PI controllers are used in which the output can either be the outputs of the two, i.e. the PI or fuzzy units being switched as per the predetermined speed errors or be a combination of the two outputs with separate weights assigned to them with online calculations for the weights from the speed errors. The former method based on switching often causes chattering effects, and later method demands larger execution time because of inclusion of separate switching algorithms. This paper reports the vector control of PMSM with hybrid fuzzy-PI speed controller with switching functions calculated based on the weights for both the controller outputs using the output of (a) only the fuzzy controller, (b) only the PI controller and (c) a combination of the outputs of both the controllers. These switching functions are very simple and effective and do not demand any extra computations to arrive at the hybrid fuzzy-PI controller outputs. These control algorithms have been simulated and also implemented on hardware with TMS320F2812 digital signal processor, and it is observed that the performance of the vector controlled PMSM drive with these hybrid fuzzy-PI speed controllers in terms of the response and torque ripples is very promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10879934","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257034/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PM Synchronous Motor Speed Control Using Hybrid Fuzzy-PI With Novel Switching Functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PM Synchronous Motor Speed Control Using Hybrid Fuzzy-PI With Novel Switching Functions","sourcePdf":"tmag-rajagopal-2022191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051394S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5257056,"authors":[{"name":"L.

On the other hand, permanent-magnet (PM) gear has drawn significant attention from both academies and industries due to the conspicuous merits, such as reduced acoustic noise, maintenance free, improved reliability, precise peak torque transmission capability, and inherent overload protection. In this paper, a magnetic-geared PM brushless motor is presented. It is a novel low-speed and high-torque motor which merges the advantages of conventional PM brushless motor and PM gear. Its topology and operation principle are introduced. Some techniques are employed to optimize and improve the motor performance, while the validity of the proposed techniques is verified with finite-element analysis. Moreover, an alternative operation condition, which can further reduce the motor speed and increase its output torque, is proposed and analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257056.pdf","startPage":"4578","endPage":"4581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Magnetic-Geared Permanent-Magnet Brushless Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brushless motors","Gears","Torque","Permanent magnet motors","Topology","Magnetic analysis","Acoustic noise","Finite element methods","Rotors","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drives","permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic-geared permanent-magnet brushless motor","low-speed electrical drives","high-torque electrical drives","mechanical gearing","reduced acoustic noise","maintenance free","improved reliability","peak torque transmission capability","overload protection","permanent-magnet gear"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct drive","finite-element analysis","high torque","low speed","magnetic gear","permanent-magnet (PM) motor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Magnetic-Geared Permanent-Magnet Brushless Motor","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257056/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879955","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Magnetic-Geared Permanent-Magnet Brushless Motor","sourcePdf":"tmag-lwang-2023071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047821S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5257085,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this work, we apply image processing techniques to a scanning electron microscope image of a candidate BPM nano-mask, produced by a self-assembly technique, to estimate likely size and location fluctuations of the islands. These statistics may also be useful to characterize the samples of candidate BPM masks. We assume that these observed fluctuations are representative of patterning noise that might result from such a mask. The results indicate that these fluctuations are correlated and can be modeled by Gaussian random processes. Using estimated characteristics of islands size and location fluctuations, we model the correlated media noise and investigate the performance of BPM channels in the presence of such correlated media noise.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

supply, the cause of noise should be investigated. We carry out vibration analysis of a single phase of a reactor while considering electromagnetism and magnetostriction to clarify the mechanism of noise generation in the reactor. In this analysis, magnetostriction is modeled three-dimensionally with equivalent nodal forces. First, the nodal forces in the cores of reactor due to the electromagetism and magnetostriction are calculated using the flux distribution obtained from magnetic field analysis. To determine the dominant cause of noise, the spatial distributions of displacements generated by both nodal forces are then obtained by static structure analysis and they are compared in detail. Moreover, the actual movements of the cores are calculated by vibration analysis. Finally, the effect of the hardness of the cores on noise generation is calculated and measured. It is shown that the hardness of the insulator inserted in gaps between cores affects the vibration and it seems to have an optimal value. Moreover, the analyzed results are proved by measurement.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257228.pdf","startPage":"4789","endPage":"4792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vibration Analysis of a Reactor Driven by an Inverter Power Supply Considering Electromagnetism and Magnetostriction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Vibration Analysis of a Reactor Driven by an Inverter Power Supply Considering Electromagnetism and Magnetostriction","volume":"45","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5257228/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880121","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257228/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vibration Analysis of a Reactor Driven by an Inverter Power Supply Considering Electromagnetism and Magnetostriction","sourcePdf":"tmag-ygao-2024638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084903S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5257236,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Wook Cho","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han-Wook","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276158200"},{"name":"Hyung-Suk Han","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Suk","lastName":"Han","id":"37289999500"},{"name":"Jong-Min Lee","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406221800"},{"name":"Bong-Sub Kim","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bong-Sub","lastName":"Kim","id":"38104711000"},{"name":"So-Young Sung","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"So-Young","lastName":"Sung","id":"37393452800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5257236","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":667},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257236","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Propulsion","Magnetic devices","Vehicles","Testing","Electromagnets","Permanent magnets","Coercive force","Synchronous motors","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coercive force","electric propulsion","linear motors","magnetic levitation","permanent magnet machines","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EM-PM hybrid levitation","propulsion device","magnetically levitated vehicle","electromagnet-permanent magnet hybrid levitation","permanent magnet machine","coercive force","long-stator linear synchronous motor","levitation airgap length","zero-power levitation control","machine structure","translator structure","U-shape magnets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnet/permanent magnet (EM-PM) hybrid","levitation and propulsion","linear synchronous motor (LSM)","maglev","zero-power control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023998","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257236.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"4632","endPage":"4635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Considerations of EM-PM Hybrid Levitation and Propulsion Device for Magnetically Levitated Vehicle","abstract":"This paper deals with the design considerations of electromagnet/permanent magnet (EM-PM) hybrid levitation and propulsion device for magnetically levitated (maglev) vehicle. The machine requires PMs with high coercive force in order to levitate the vehicle by only PMs, and propulsion force is supplied by long-stator linear synchronous motor (LSM). The advantages of this configuration are an increasing levitation airgap length and decreasing total weight of the vehicle, because of the zero-power levitation control. Several design considerations such as machine structure, manufacturing, and control strategy are described.

The use of an iron core under dc-biased magnetization gives rise to asymmetrical hysteresis loops and the hysteresis loss in the iron core also increases with the value of dc excitation. For iron cores working with dc-biased excitation, accurate modeling of the nonlinear characteristics for the iron core that includes the dc-bias is very important for the computation of the exciting current and the iron loss. In this paper, an efficient approach for simulating the hysteresis loop of iron core under dc-biased excitation using neural-network theory is presented. The proposed method has the merits that a specific hysteresis loop can be identified conveniently and effectively to ensure that accurate electromagnetic-field analysis can be realized.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023070","startPage":"3958","endPage":"3961","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257257.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2023070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Magnetic Hysteresis Under DC-Biased Magnetization Using the Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic hysteresis","Magnetization","Neural networks","Iron","Magnetic cores","Steel","Magnetic properties","Coils","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iron","magnetic hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic hysteresis","dc-biased magnetization","neural network","hysteresis loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-biased excitation","hysteresis model","magnetic property","neural-network theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Magnetic Hysteresis Under DC-Biased Magnetization Using the Neural Network","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257257/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10880149","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Magnetic Hysteresis Under DC-Biased Magnetization Using the Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tmag-liu-2023070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066851S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5257266,"authors":[{"name":"Yukoh Katoh","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukoh","lastName":"Katoh","id":"37690255700"},{"name":"Shinsaku Saito","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsaku","lastName":"Saito","id":"38560116900"},{"name":"Hiroaki Honjo","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Honjo","id":"37300124200"},{"name":"Ryusuke Nebashi","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryusuke","lastName":"Nebashi","id":"37294561200"},{"name":"Noboru Sakimura","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Noboru","lastName":"Sakimura","id":"37300122300"},{"name":"Tetsuhiro Suzuki","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuhiro","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37290094600"},{"name":"Sadahiko Miura","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Sadahiko","lastName":"Miura","id":"37286078400"},{"name":"Tadahiko Sugibayashi","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadahiko","lastName":"Sugibayashi","id":"37300124900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5257266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"We have demonstrated 500-MHz operation with our high-speed magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM).

Although some failure modes related to the switching current distribution among multiple cells caused by rotated or shifted magnetic properties have been reported, they do not explain the extraordinary properties of each cell. To determine the origin of these properties, we investigated the influence of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) edge concave and convex deformation observed in MRAM fabrication. We found that the edge deformation and changed switching process generated a magnetization vortex, causing large switching current in a simulation. The switching characteristics of MTJs with some MTJ edge structures were fabricated and their characteristics were evaluated. We revealed that the edge deformation causes both large switching current and large switching current distribution of each cell. These characteristics correspond with those observed in the MRAM evaluation. Because cell sizes will become smaller and deformation size will become relatively large in the future, controlling MTJ shapes will become increasingly important for developing next-generation MRAMs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current distribution","Magnetic tunneling","Magnetic switching","Magnetic properties","Magnetization","Shape control","Magnetic analysis","Magnetoresistance","Random access memory","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic switching","magnetic tunnelling","magnetisation","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching current distribution","next-generation high-speed MRAM","high-speed magnetoresistive random access memory","magnetization switching current","magnetic tunnel junction","MTJ edge concave deformation","MTJ edge convex deformation","frequency 500 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic memories","magnetization reversal","magnetoresistive devices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257266","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022336","startPage":"3804","endPage":"3807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MTJ Edge Deformation Influence on Switching Current Distribution for Next-Generation High-Speed MRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MTJ Edge Deformation Influence on Switching Current Distribution for Next-Generation High-Speed MRAMs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257266/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257266/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880158","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MTJ Edge Deformation Influence on Switching Current Distribution for Next-Generation High-Speed MRAMs","sourcePdf":"tmag-katoh-2022336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053412S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5257278,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel A.

The Finite Element Method (FEM) has proven be to be powerful numerical technique for solving the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) describing eddy currents. In order to solve the PDE, boundary conditions must be provided, and in many applications the boundary conditions are not known explicitly but can be provided by a Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor (RLC) circuit model. The emphasis of this paper is on an efficient and exact coupling of the RLC network equations with the FEM equations. The coupling is based on an exact linear algebra identity known as the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) formula. One advantage of this approach is that the FEM matrices are not modified. This is important if a fast ldquoblack-boxrdquo solver is available for the FEM matrices, these solvers typically require that the matrices have certain mathematical properties and these properties are not modified by the SMW approach. A second advantage is that the SMW approach is valid for an arbitrary number of independent external circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257278.pdf","startPage":"3915","endPage":"3918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2022274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury Formula for Coupling External Circuits With FEM for Simulation of Eddy Current Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupling circuits","Circuit simulation","Eddy currents","RLC circuits","Pulsed power supplies","Finite element methods","Partial differential equations","Boundary conditions","Capacitors","EMP radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","eddy currents","finite element analysis","matrix algebra","partial differential equations","RLC circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula","external circuits","FEM","three-dimensional transient eddy current problems","finite element method","partial differential equations","PDE","boundary conditions","resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit model","RLC network","exact linear algebra","black-box solver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuits","eddy currents","finite element","pulse power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury Formula for Coupling External Circuits With FEM for Simulation of Eddy Current Problems","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257278/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880169","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury Formula for Coupling External Circuits With FEM for Simulation of Eddy Current Problems","sourcePdf":"tmag-white-2022274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5257290,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

In this paper, the prospects for these alternative technologies to displace HDDs in 2020 are analyzed. In order to compare technologies, projections were made of storage density and performance in year 2020 for both hard disks and the alternative technologies, assuming the alternative technologies could solve their remaining problems and assuming that hard drives would continue to advance areal density at a pace of about 40% per year, which would result in a two-disk 2.5-in disk drive that stores approximately 40 Terabytes and costs about $40. A major conclusion of the study is that to compete with hard drives on a cost per terabyte basis will be challenging for any solid state technology, because the ITRS lithography roadmap limits the density that most alternative technologies can achieve. Those technologies with the best opportunity have a small cell size and the capability of storing multiple bits per cell. Phase change random access memory (PCRAM) and spin transfer torque random access memory (STTRAM) appear to meet these criteria. PCRAMs are being marketed by at least one supplier and therefore appear to be closer to practical realization. On the other hand, STTRAMs would appear to have a performance edge assuming they, too, can be brought to market with multiple bits per cell. Although there are technologies that are not limited by the lithography roadmap and thus have greater areal density potential, they tend to be further from practical realization.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257331.pdf","startPage":"3406","endPage":"3413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"After Hard Drives\u2014What Comes Next?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"After Hard Drives\u2014What Comes Next?","volume":"45","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5257331/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880218","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257331/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"After Hard Drives\u2014What Comes Next?","sourcePdf":"tmag-ckim-2024163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072863S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5257335,"authors":[{"name":"Yasuaki Nakamura","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuaki","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37656966700"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Okamoto","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37336474400"},{"name":"Hisashi Osawa","affiliation":["Institution for Collaborative Relations, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Osawa","id":"37297985400"},{"name":"Hajime Aoi","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hajime","lastName":"Aoi","id":"37266430600"},{"name":"Hiroaki Muraoka","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC), University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Muraoka","id":"37275122300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5257335","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Magnetic recording","Computer errors","Magnetic heads","Collaboration","Computer simulation","Error correction codes","Lattices","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","iterative decoding","magnetic recording","parity check codes","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC coding","iterative decoding system","magnetic recording system","write error","bit-patterned medium","low-density parity-check coding","write synchronization","recording sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-patterned medium (BPM)","iterative decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) code","write error"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding and iterative decoding system is studied in the magnetic recording system using a bit-patterned medium (BPM).

Simulation results show that the proposed 2-D equalizer with 1-D target based approach achieves significant performance gain over the system designed without considering media noise.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Signal analysis","Magnetic noise","Ground penetrating radar","Interference","Jitter","Magnetic analysis","Signal generators","Signal design","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","magnetic recording noise","mean square error methods","storage media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional equalization","bit-patterned media channels","media noise","readback signals","2D equalizer","1D channel partial response","minimum mean square error","magnetic recording"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D island pulse response","bit-patterned media","inter-track interference","media noise","two-dimensional equalization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5257336","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024427","startPage":"3535","endPage":"3538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Two-Dimensional Equalization for Bit-Patterned Media Channels With Media Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Two-Dimensional Equalization for Bit-Patterned Media Channels With Media Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257336/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","volume":"45","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5257336/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10880223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Two-Dimensional Equalization for Bit-Patterned Media Channels With Media Noise","sourcePdf":"tmag-yng-2024427.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049599S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5257351,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Several promising technology options have been explored to increase the areal density beyond the limit such as bit patterned magnetic recording (BPMR), heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), and microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR). In addition to these three technology options, there is recent interest in a fourth approach that has the advantage of staying with a relatively conventional perpendicular medium and head. This combines shingled write recording (SWR) and/or 2-D read back and signal processing. Either technique can be used separately to give large gains and the combination of the two, which is referred to as 2-D magnetic recording (TDMR), promises particularly large gains. Recording with energy assist on BPM or 2-D signal processing will enable the areal density beyond around 5 Tb/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, although none of them have shown a clear problem-free solution.

It shows that it is simple to manufacture compared to E-core SPM actuators and solves the problem of significant leakage flux in C-core actuators. In addition, the E-core IPM actuator is capable of producing reluctance force due to the salient mover structure, which enhances the spring stiffness and is conducive to the oscillation, although has no contribution to the output power. The influence of the magnet pole ratio and split ratio on the performance of the IPM LOA is investigated, and the optimal parameters have been identified with reference to the peak value and flatness of the excitation force-displacement characteristic.

Furthermore, an array-coil unit which consists of 7 circular coils is also analyzed using an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) to search for the optimal parameters of the coils in order to obtain the desired deep and sharp distribution of magnetic fields in deep magnetic stimulation.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2025892","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5256997/05257436.pdf","startPage":"4849","endPage":"4852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2025892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5256997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Array Magnetic Coil Design for Functional Magnetic Stimulation Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5257436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Array Magnetic Coil Design for Functional Magnetic Stimulation Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm","volume":"45","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10880278","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5257436/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Array Magnetic Coil Design for Functional Magnetic Stimulation Based on Improved Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tmag-gxu-2025892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078814S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5256997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5256997","articleId":"5257436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5259073,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, it addresses two important subjects of AC induction motor drives: the control of the machine and the speed estimation is sensorless drives. On this basis, this work summarizes the fuzzy-neural control and the speed estimator based on a MRAS. Speed control performance and sensorless speed estimation and induction motors are affected by parameter variations and nonlinearities in the induction motor. This paper also uses a very realistic and practical scheme to estimate and control the noise content in the speed load torque characteristic of the motor. The technique MRAS rotor speed estimator has been incorporated for which stability, robustness and parameter variations are assured. The aim of the proposed control fuzzy-neural ANFIS is to improve the performance and robustness of the induction motor drives under non linear loads variations is presented in this work. The availability of the proposed structure scheme is verified by through a laboratory implementation and under computation simulations with Matlab-software. The proposed technique can be generalized to other motor drives. Simulation results are presented in order to prove the excellent tracking performance of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ELECTROMOTION.2009.5259073","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234983/5259072/05259073.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 8th International Symposium on Advanced Electromechanical Motion Systems & Electric Drives Joint Symposium","publicationTitle":"2009 8th International Symposium on Advanced Electromechanical Motion Systems & Electric Drives Joint Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTROMOTION.2009.5259073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5259072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-neural networks controller-based adapatation mechanism for MRAS sensorless induction motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-neural networks controller-based adapatation mechanism for MRAS sensorless induction motor drives","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10892890","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5259073/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-neural networks controller-based adapatation mechanism for MRAS sensorless induction motor drives","confLoc":"Lillie, France","sourcePdf":"ELECTROMOTION2009Paper84DS210PID975399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076729S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234983","isNumber":"5259072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234983","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5259072","articleId":"5259073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5259074,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Bahri","affiliation":["Tunis le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Imen","lastName":"Bahri","id":"37541326500"},{"name":"Jihen Arbi","affiliation":["Tunis le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Jihen","lastName":"Arbi","id":"38322698100"},{"name":"Ilhem Slama-Belkhodja","affiliation":["Tunis le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ilhem","lastName":"Slama-Belkhodja","id":"38271006100"},{"name":"E.

Topology optimization methods have the advantage to release this constraint. They are based on a splitting of the design space into cells, in which they attempt to distribute optimally some given materials. In this paper, the optimization is based on a discrete formulation of the Maxwell equations obtained thanks to a finite element model. The gradient of the objective function is computed immediately from this discrete form, which is more convenient than the adjoint variable method. A line-search method (steepest descent direction) is then applied. The step size is computed by a simple and quick algorithm, to achieve good and fast convergence. Several convexity issues were already highlighted in topology optimization. We explain how we can face some of them by performing the optimization on a variable linked to the permeability by a given mapping. This mapping actually affects the value of intermediate materials and must be selected carefully to avoid the algorithm to be trapped in some local minimizers. In order to illustrate the concepts presented along the paper, the method is applied for the topology optimization of a linear reluctant actuator.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTROMOTION.2009.5259087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5259072","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 8th International Symposium on Advanced Electromechanical Motion Systems & Electric Drives Joint Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5234983/5259072/05259087.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology optimization method applied to the design of electromagnetic devices: Focus on convexity issues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5259087/","displayDocTitle":"Topology optimization method applied to the design of electromagnetic devices: Focus on convexity issues","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10892829","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology optimization method applied to the design of electromagnetic devices: Focus on convexity issues","confLoc":"Lillie, France","sourcePdf":"ELECTROMOTION2009Paper69DS14PID975347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094501S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5234983","isNumber":"5259072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5234983","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5259072","articleId":"5259087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5259098,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The PHD filter admits a closed-form solution for a linear Gaussian multi-target model. However, this model is not general enough to accommodate maneuvering targets that switch between several models. In this paper, we generalize the notion of linear jump Markov systems to the multiple target case to accommodate births, deaths, and switching dynamics. We then derive a closed-form solution to the PHD recursion for the proposed linear Gaussian jump Markov multi-target model. Based on this an efficient method for tracking multiple maneuvering targets that switch between a set of linear Gaussian models is developed. An analytic implementation of the PHD filter using statistical linear regression technique is also proposed for targets that switch between a set of nonlinear models. We demonstrate through simulations that the proposed PHD filters are effective in tracking multiple maneuvering targets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5259174/","accessionNumber":"10890512","displayDocTitle":"A Gaussian Mixture PHD Filter for Jump Markov System Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Gaussian Mixture PHD Filter for Jump Markov System Models","sourcePdf":"45aes03-Pasha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07296S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5259163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5259163","articleId":"5259174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5259179,"authors":[{"name":"Kusha Panta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5259163/5259179/5259179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kusha Panta received his B.E. degree (with first-class honors) from The University of Melbourne, Australia in 1997, M.E. degree from La Trobe University, Australia, in 2002, and Ph.D. degree from The University of Melbourne in 2007.","Currently, he is a research fellow at The Melbourne System Laboratory (MSL), The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia.

Two significant challenges are: 1) the large amount of image data can be taxing for a human operator over a long period of time (as well as for other system resources such as network bandwidth), and 2) relatively expensive optics and large focal plane arrays are needed to produce high quality images. Compressed sensing holds the promise for radically novel sensors that can perfectly reconstruct images using comparatively simple hardware and considerably fewer samples of data than required by the otherwise general Shannon sampling theorem. It has been shown by Candes, Romberg, and Tao, Donoho, and others that by measuring relatively few projections of a scene on random vectors, iterative greedy algorithms and basis pursuit techniques that minimize the L1 norm of the solution vector can perfectly reconstruct the entire image. To reduce the load on the human operator, however, it is also desirable to cue regions of the image where objects of interest may exist. Towards this end, we are interested here in selectively imaging interesting objects in a scene, without necessarily seeking perfect reconstruction of the whole image. We show that our goals are achieved by minimizing a modified L2-norm criterion when the reconstruction of only specific objects is of interest. We achieve this by introducing prior knowledge about objects in a known basis as soft constraints in the reconstruction equation. At first blush it may appear that the same could be achieved by measuring projections of the objects directly on the basis set. However, this trivial solution requires that the basis functions be changed for every object; thus, the solution is not suitable for practical applications. We show that the proposed approach takes advantage of the simplicity, elegance, and generality of the compressed sensing architecture by achieving object-specific reconstruction using random projection on simple binary masks. Most importantly, a single set of random projective measurements can be used to algorithmically reconstruct any object of interest without requiring explicit and repeated measurements on different basis sets that vary with the object of interest. Clearly, this has significant implications on system issues and practical consideration such as hardware complexity and time required for searching for objects over a large number of classes. Our assumption that some information is known about specific objects of interest is distinctly different from the original theory of compressed sensing as postulated by Candes, et al. and Donoho. The proposed method is not an alternative when the perfect reconstruction of arbitrary images is required, but nevertheless operates within the same framework by extracting information from compressive measurements. The proposed method yields a simple closed-form analytical solution that does not require iterative processing. Objects can be meaningfully sensed in considerable detail while heavily compressing the scene elsewhere. Essentially, this embeds the object detection and clutter discrimination function in the sensing and imaging process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a compressed sensing architecture that is explicitly tailored for surveillance scenarios where the ability to find specific objects is of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5259191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5259163/05259191.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5259191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5259163","startPage":"1167","endPage":"1180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Specific Image Reconstruction using a Compressive Sensing Architecture for Application in Surveillance Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5259191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Object Specific Image Reconstruction using a Compressive Sensing Architecture for Application in Surveillance Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10890519","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5259191/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Specific Image Reconstruction using a Compressive Sensing Architecture for Application in Surveillance Systems","sourcePdf":"45aes03-Mahalanobis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081593S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5259163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5259163","articleId":"5259191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5259194,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["Aware, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5259163/5259194/5259194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Wu received the B.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China in 2005, and the M.S. degree from the University of Arizona, Tucson, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.","From 2006\u20132007, he was a graduate research assistant in the Laboratory for Sensor and Array Processing in the ECE Department at the University of Arizona.

In a switched-element system, simultaneous data collection occurs on only a subset of the array's N elements at any given time. The data collection interval is divided into subintervals, and at each subinterval a multiplexer selects a different subset of M<N elements to connect to the data acquisition channels. Since the switched-element system only collects data on M channels at a time, hardware costs can be reduced at the expense of a time-accuracy tradeoff compared to a full-channel system. We propose two algorithms. The first is a modification of the root-MVDR (minimum variance distortionless-response) algorithm that is appropriate for linear arrays and noncoherent sources. When sources are coherent, a second algorithm based on a compositely formed full-size covariance matrix is proposed. Although performance depends strongly on the number of sources, good performance can be obtained even when the number of sources is greater than M.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","volume":"45","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10880998","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5259194/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Switched-Element Direction Finding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-Element Direction Finding","sourcePdf":"45aes03-Wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060385S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5259163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5259163","articleId":"5259194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5259195,"authors":[{"name":"Jabran Akhtar","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Kjeller, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5259163/5259195/5259195-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jabran Akhtar received the M.Sc. degree in informatics from the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications also from University of Oslo in 2005.","Since 2006 he has been with Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI)."]},"firstName":"Jabran","lastName":"Akhtar","id":"37533801900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5259195","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":849},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic countermeasures","Jamming","Diversity methods","Radar countermeasures","Radar imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Radar signal processing","Pulse modulation","Chirp modulation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","electronic countermeasures","orthogonal codes","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal block coded ECCM","repeat radar jammers","radar signaling","radar systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper develops radar signaling schemes to combat the impact of repeat jammers on radar systems.

Similarities and specifics of behavioral modeling and digital predistortion were presented. Thereby, digital predistortion can be seen as a behavioral modeling problem for which performance assessment is much more straightforward. For DUT behavioral modeling, there is no comprehensive metric that allows the model performance evaluation while taking into account the model accuracy in predicting all the three components of the DUT behavior (in-band distortion, static nonlinearity and memory effects).

On-going research and development activities are presently addressing the multitone requirement. The availability of RF I-V measurement and engineering capability extends the characterization opportunities for both high-frequency/speed transistor technology developers and circuit/system designers; terminal waveforms are the unifying theoretical link between transistor technology, circuit design, and system performance. Design support can involve the direct utilization of such a measurement system in the design investigation/evaluation loop of either power transistor technology or PAs. This eliminates the black box design processes and allows for the development of new intelligent design processes that are completely founded on theoretical waveform analysis. Alternatively, it can also indirectly support the amplifier investigation/evaluation loop by supporting the development or improving the accuracy of nonlinear transistor models or by providing CAD-accessible behavioral or behavioral model parameter datasets. W can now only hope that, triggered by the availability of RF waveform measurement and engineering systems, we will see a renaissance in theoretical waveform mathematical analysis addressing not only power and efficiency but also design sensitivity and linearity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Systems engineering and theory","Availability","Design engineering","Power measurement","Process design","Power system modeling","Research and development","Velocity measurement","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","power transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["practical waveform engineering","RF I-V waveform measurement","continuous wave stimulus","multitone requirement","terminal waveforms","high-frequency transistor technology","circuit design","power transistor technology","nonlinear transistor models","CAD"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMM.2009.934518","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/5259202/05259212.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5259202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2009.934518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical waveform engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5259212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical waveform engineering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259212/","volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5259212/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10985635","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical waveform engineering","sourcePdf":"10-10mmm07-tasker.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111252S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"5259202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5259202","articleId":"5259212","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5259701,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Yale University, New Heaven, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5259693/5259701/5259701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Tang (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Peking University, Peking, China, in 2006 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at Yale University, New Haven, CT.","In 2007, he became a Research Assistant affiliated with Yale E-Lab.

The transceiver chip is designed for close-coupled MEMS transducer arrays which operate with a 3.3-V power supply. In addition, a transmit digital beamforming system architecture is supported in this work. A prototype chip containing 16 receive and transmit channels with preamplifiers, time-gain compensation amplifiers, a multiplexed analog-to-digital converter with 3 kB of on-chip SRAM, and 50-MHz resolution time delayed excitation pulse generators has been fabricated. By utilizing a shared A/D converter architecture, the number of A/D converter and SRAM is cut down to one, unlike typical digital beamforming systems which need 16 A/D converters for 16 receive channels. The chip was fabricated in a 0.35-mum standard CMOS process. The chip size is 10 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and its average power consumption in receive mode is approximately 270 mW with a 3.3-V power supply. The transceiver chip specifications and designs are described, as well as measured results of each transceiver component and initial pulse-echo experimental results are presented.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/5259693/05259718.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5259693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2023912","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2023912","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5259718","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Transceivers","Power supplies","Array signal processing","Random access memory","Pulse measurements","Image resolution","Micromechanical devices","Ultrasonic transducers","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","CMOS digital integrated circuits","micromechanical devices","transceivers","ultrasonic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS ultrasound transceiver chip","ultrasonic imaging","MEMS transducer arrays","transmit digital beamforming system","time-gain compensation","analog-to-digital converter","on-chip SRAM","A/D converter","power consumption","voltage 3.3 V","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital beamforming","high-frequency PZT transducer","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasound transceiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Ultrasound Transceiver Chip for High-Resolution Ultrasonic Imaging Systems","accessionNumber":"10890441","pubMedId":"23853268","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Ultrasound Transceiver Chip for High-Resolution Ultrasonic Imaging Systems","sourcePdf":"tbcas-ikim-2023912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039489S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","isNumber":"5259693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"34","articleId":"5259718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5259744,"authors":[{"name":"Alistair McEwan","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, London, UK","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5259693/5259744/5259744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alistair McEwan (M'89\u2013SM'09) He received the B.E.,B.Com. and M.Phil. degrees in economics and in electrical engineering from The University of Sydney, Sydney.

Code-division multiplexing is proposed as a new method that can provide simultaneous impedance measurements of the multiple channels. Code division provides clear advantages of a wide frequency range at reduced cost and reduced complexity of sources. A potential drawback is the lack of perfectly orthogonal code sets. This caused an increase of 0.62% in root-mean-square spectral error when two codes were used to record two impedance channels simultaneously on a low-pass filter network. The method described provides images and spectra which are equivalent to the conventional time-multiplexed method, with increases in frequency resolution and measurement speed which may be of benefit in some applications of electrical impedance tomography spectroscopy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10890439","htmlLink":"/document/5259744/","pubMedId":"23853272","displayDocTitle":"Code-Division-Multiplexed Electrical Impedance Tomography Spectroscopy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Division-Multiplexed Electrical Impedance Tomography Spectroscopy","sourcePdf":"tbcas-amcewan-2032159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080447S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"5259693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5259693","articleId":"5259744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5259916,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Xu","affiliation":["Ecole Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel, UMR CNRS 6133, Marseilles, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5288428/5259916/5259916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Xu was born in 1983.

Frequency hopping within the first three bands of IEEE 802.15.3a has been used in experiments to obtain an MB-OFDM UWB signal. The frequency quadrupling can be achieved by using only one Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and two cascaded MZMs. It is found that using one MZM is better than using two cascaded MZMs in the performance of mm-wave generation. For using one MZM, it is found that transmission through 20 km of fiber degrades the EVM by less than 0.5 dB compared with back-to-back. Also, the EVM is degraded by less than 1 and 0.25 dB for a bias drift of less than 20% and an extinction ratio of more than 10 dB, respectively. Moreover, the EVM of the system using one MZM is improved by more than 2.5 dB compared with the two cascaded MZMs. In addition, it is found that the minimum EVM required of -17 dB can be achieved by using a local oscillator modulation index of ~63% and 70% at least for using the one MZM and two cascaded MZMs, respectively.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.1.000428","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5288428/05259918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.1.000428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5288428","startPage":"428","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Quadrupler for Millimeter-Wave Multiband OFDM Ultrawideband Wireless Signals and Distribution Over Fiber Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5259918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Quadrupler for Millimeter-Wave Multiband OFDM Ultrawideband Wireless Signals and Distribution Over Fiber Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939184","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5259918/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Quadrupler for Millimeter-Wave Multiband OFDM Ultrawideband Wireless Signals and Distribution Over Fiber Systems","sourcePdf":"428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072667S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5288428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5288428","articleId":"5259918","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5259920,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Jurado-Navas","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of M\u00e0laga, Malaga, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5288428/5259920/5259920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Jurado-Navas (S'06) received the Telecommunication Engineering Degree from the University of M\u00e1laga Spain, in 2002, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of M\u00e1laga.

Even if the interference is off axis, its signal can couple into the receiver through scattering. We would like our communication system to perform well in the presence of interference, background noise, and fading. This paper investigates the performance of diversity coherent and incoherent receivers in the presence of fading, background noise, and various interference types. We find that diversity coherent detection provides significant power gain over diversity direct detection and that most of the benefit of diversity coherent detection can be achieved with a small amount of diversity. Moreover, we find that diversity always improves the performance of coherent detection, whereas in the presence of worst-case interference, diversity degrades the performance of direct detection. This paper also describes a sensible way to select the amount of diversity and power margin to deal with atmospheric turbulence and interference and quantifies the amount of interference that the system can handle while still achieving a given outage probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5259921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5259921/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10927453","volume":"1","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Coherent and Incoherent Receivers for Free-Space Optical Communication in the Presence and Absence of Interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Coherent and Incoherent Receivers for Free-Space Optical Communication in the Presence and Absence of Interference","sourcePdf":"463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054846S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5288428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5288428","articleId":"5259921","onlineDate":"25 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
