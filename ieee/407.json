At the switch level, a circuit is modeled as a network of transistor switches connecting a set of charge storage nodes. Node voltages are represented by discrete logic levels, and electrical behavior is modeled in a highly simplified way. Switch-level algorithms have been applied to such tasks as logic and fault simulation, formal hardware verification, timing analysis, and automatic test program generation. They have been implemented on sequential and parallel computers as well as by hardware simulation accelerators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4070016/","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Switch-Level Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Switch-Level Algorithms","sourcePdf":"MDT-v4-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039637S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4070007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"49","articleId":"4070016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4070044,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In addition to accelerating many graph-related problem solutions, MARS is ideally suited for performing event-driven simulations of VLSI circuits. Its highly pipelined and parallel architecture yields a performance comparable to that of existing special-purpose hardware simulators. MARS has the added advantage of flexibility because its VLSI processors are custom-designed to be microprogrammable and reconfigurable. When programmed as a logic simulator, MARS should be able to achieve 1 million gate evaluations per second.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MARS: A Multiprocessor-Based Programmable Accelerator","doi":"10.1109/MDT.1987.295211","startPage":"28","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.1987.295211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4070034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4070034/04070044.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4070044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4070044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1987","displayDocTitle":"MARS: A Multiprocessor-Based Programmable Accelerator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MARS: A Multiprocessor-Based Programmable Accelerator","sourcePdf":"MDT-v4-n5-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067407S","chronDate":"Oct.  1987","isNumber":"4070034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4070044","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4070065,"authors":[{"name":"Lindsay Kleeman","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lindsay","lastName":"Kleeman","id":"37319383900"},{"name":"Antonio Cantoni","affiliation":["University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Cantoni","id":"37269399500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0740-7475"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1918"}],"articleNumber":"4070065","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":25,"totalDownloads":1009},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design and Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metastasis","Digital systems","Timing","Clocks","Flip-flops","Digital circuits","Propagation delay","Combinational circuits","Delay effects","Circuit faults"]}],"abstract":"Fault-free digital circuits may malfunction when asynchronous inputs have critical timing combinations that result in metastable operation.

In order to realize economical HA, a standard protocol for HBS was established and standardized interface LSIs were developed. These LSIs were incorporated into various equipment made by different manufacturers and usefulness of the HBS was verified by system experiments undertaken in two model houses.

A class-G PA consists of two or more parallel-connected class-B PAs with different supply voltages. Low-voltage segments of the signal are amplified by the low-voltage component of the amplifier, thus reducing power dissipation and increasing efficiency. The average efficiency of a class-G PA depends upon both the supply-voltage transition point and the amplitude distribution of the signal. Average efficiencies are computed for a number of signals that occur in AF amplification, full- carrier amplitude modulation, and envelope modulation of a linear RF PA. For typical peak-to-average ratios, an ideal, two-voltage class-G PA has average efficiencies in the range of 60 to 70 percent, in contrast to the 35 to 40 percent of an analogous class-B PA.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1986.290146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4071343/04071365.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1986.290146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average Efficiency of Class-G Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4071365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071365/","displayDocTitle":"Average Efficiency of Class-G Power Amplifiers","volume":"CE-32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average Efficiency of Class-G Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"TCE-vCE-32-n2-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058141S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4071343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"71","articleId":"4071365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4071396,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Tsinberg","affiliation":["Philips Laboratories, North American Philips Corporation, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Tsinberg","id":"37620472800"},{"name":"Eberhard Fisch","affiliation":["Philips Laboratories, North American Philips Corporation, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Eberhard","lastName":"Fisch","id":"37386417200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"4071396","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":20},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Decoding","Sampling methods","TV","Transmitters","Delay lines","Digital signal processing","Equations","Fourier transforms","Laboratories"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a method of NTSC compatible encoding and decoding of chrominance and luminance.

An optional technique widens the image aspect ratio and creates bandwidth within the original NTSC standard large enough to transmit a digitally-encoded stereo audio signal to match the improved visual characteristics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1987.290212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071488","startPage":"14","endPage":"27","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4071488/04071500.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proposal for a New High-Definition NTSC Broadcast Protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1987","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Proposal for a New High-Definition NTSC Broadcast Protocol","publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"CE-33","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposal for a New High-Definition NTSC Broadcast Protocol","sourcePdf":"TCE-vCE-33-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05373S","chronDate":"Feb.  1987","isNumber":"4071488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4071500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4071504,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Encoder systems decompose the wide aspect ratio source image into a center 4:3 image and two side panels, maintaining compatibility with existing standards (NTSC) for the center picture. Transmission schemes then transmit the center image over a standard 6 Mhz TV channel (channel 1) and the panel information over another channel (channel 2). Decoders which accept the center and panel information recombine the signals to construct the original wider image. An example of this technique is utilized in the two channel ENTSC System [1]. Due to linear distortions, various parameters such as hue, saturation, black level, gain and static time delay must be normalized in both video signals before recombination of the wide aspect ratio picture. A description of techniques which employ insertion of a training signal at the transmitter and a microprocessor at the receiver, used to control these parameters is presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1987.290255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4071510/04071533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1987.290255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071510","startPage":"154","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Matching Techniques for 2-Channel Television","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4071533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Matching Techniques for 2-Channel Television","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"CE-33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Matching Techniques for 2-Channel Television","sourcePdf":"TCE-vCE-33-n3-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026781S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4071510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4071533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4071534,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Peter Cavallerano","affiliation":["Philips Laboratories, North American Philips Corporation, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Alan Peter","lastName":"Cavallerano","id":"37353869500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"4071534","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":14},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HDTV","Multimedia communication","TV broadcasting","Image reconstruction","Displays","Bandwidth","Testing","Laboratories","Signal resolution","Video signal processing"]}],"abstract":"A video system providing enhanced viewing of television pictures sourced from a widescreen format (e.g. 5\u2153:3 aspect ratio) should not preclude compatibility with NTSC standards.

The acoustic method employed a search head consisting of one to three loudspeakers, used C. W. either as sources or sensors at around 100 Hz, which were held within 5 to 25 cm of the surface. It apparently detected local variations in acoustic compliance. The electric resistivity method employed a field of alternating current injected into the ground outside the area to be searched, and a symmetrical-coil magnetic-gradient search head. Both methods utilized induced proximity effects which diminish rapidly with distance, but experiments indicated that they are capable of detecting nonmetallic objects buried as deeply as 25 cm in bare or grass-covered soil, without disturbing or touching the ground being searched. The thermal method employed a differential radiation detector operating at infrared wavelengths greater than 5 microns. It has detected localized thermal and moisture barriers under 12 cm of a uniform, bare soil, using the diurnal insolation cycle as an energy source.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1973.294303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071632/04071636.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1973.294303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Remote Acoustic, Electric, and Thermal Sensing of Small Buried Nonmetallic Objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1973","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Remote Acoustic, Electric, and Thermal Sensing of Small Buried Nonmetallic Objects","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1973","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Remote Acoustic, Electric, and Thermal Sensing of Small Buried Nonmetallic Objects","sourcePdf":"TGE-v11-n3-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037111S","chronDate":"July  1973","isNumber":"4071632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4071636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4071646,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The procedure is based on a set of descriptors which give a statistical description of porous media.

On the basis of these textural features, a simple identification rule using piecewise linear discriminant functions is developed for categorizing the photomicrograph images. The procedure was applied to a set of 243 distinct images comprising 6 distinct rock categories. The coefficients of the discriminant functions were obtained using 143 training samples. The remaining (100) samples were then processed, each sample being assigned to one of 6 possible sandstone categories.

The actual locations of the underground transmitters in each case were projected to the surface using mine maps and conventional surveying techniques. A crossed loop direction finding receiver was developed to respond to the magnetic field. A null in the horizontal magnetic field was used to identify the surface location directly above the transmitter. Evaluation of this system at five locations in the four mines revealed location errors of 13 meters, 7 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. Theoretical computations of magnetic field strengths based on transmitter frequency, ground conductivity and transmitter depth are shown along with measured profiles for two of the four mines visited. The effects of uniformly sloping terrain and dipole tilt are also examined theoretically and the results are shown to be consistent with the field measurements made under these conditions. Using known theoretical corrections for hill slope, it is shown that the measured source location can be improved to where it is within three meters of the actual location.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1973","publicationDate":"Oct. 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","volume":"11","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Direction Finding Experiments for Location of Trapped Miners","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Direction Finding Experiments for Location of Trapped Miners","sourcePdf":"TGE-v11-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026657S","chronDate":"Oct.  1973","isNumber":"4071642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4071647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4071648,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The scattering coefficient was measured for all linear polarization combinations at angles of incidence between nadir and 70\u00b0. The ground truth data consisted of soil moisture, soil and air temperatures, snow depth, snow density, and snow water equivalent. The results of the experiment indicate that the radar sensitivity to the total snow water equivalent increases in magnitude with increasing frequency and is almost angle independent for angles of incidence higher than 30\u00b0, particularly at the higher frequencies. In the 50-70\u00b0 angular range in the 6-8-GHz frequency range, the sensitivity is typically around -0.4 dB/0.1 g/cm2 of the snow water equivalent and the associated linear correlation coefficient has a magnitude of about 0.8.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071849/04071852.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1977.294490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1977.294490","startPage":"185","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments on the Radar Backscatter of Snow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071852/","displayDocTitle":"Experiments on the Radar Backscatter of Snow","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments on the Radar Backscatter of Snow","sourcePdf":"TGE-v15-n4-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057242S","chronDate":"Oct.  1977","isNumber":"4071849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4071852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4071853,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian K.

Closed form bistatic scattering coefficients are obtained using the method of field renormalization for a vegetation-like medium characterized by a random permittivity function with a large variance and a cylindrically symmetric, fast-decaying correlation function. Multiple-scattering effects are accounted for to the same extent as in the first-order renormalization approach. Behaviors of the scatter model are illustrated by computing sample cases using Carlson's permittivity model for leaves. Cursory comparison between this theory and some recent data shows general agreements in both level and angular trends, indicating promise in the use of the developed scatter model for explaining vegetation scatter.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1977.294491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071849/04071853.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1977.294491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of First-Order Renormalization Method to Scattering from a Vegetation-Like Half-Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4071853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071853/","displayDocTitle":"Application of First-Order Renormalization Method to Scattering from a Vegetation-Like Half-Space","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of First-Order Renormalization Method to Scattering from a Vegetation-Like Half-Space","sourcePdf":"TGE-v15-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067598S","chronDate":"Oct.  1977","isNumber":"4071849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"63","articleId":"4071853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4071887,"authors":[{"name":"Paul R.

Particular attention was paid to the effects of surface roughness, and a preliminary examination of the role of soil texture was performed. The results of this investigation confirm the findings of a previous experiment [1] which concluded that the effects of surface roughness can be minimized by operating at a frequency in the neighborhood of 5 GHz over the 7-17\u00b0 angle of incidence range. The precision with which soil moisture in the surface soil layer can be estimated is comparable to the precision of the ground-truthed estimate. Because the moisture in the surface layer is highly correlated to the subsurface moisture, it was not possible to determine experimentally the effective depth of the layer responsible for the observed radar backscatter.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1978.294586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071935/04071939.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1978.294586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part I-Bare Soil","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part I-Bare Soil","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part I-Bare Soil","sourcePdf":"TGE-v16-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047093S","chronDate":"Oct.  1978","isNumber":"4071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"299","articleId":"4071939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4071944,"authors":[{"name":"Constantine A.

Using a two-path interferometer at microwave frequencies (\u22439 GHz), the samples of solid eastern bituminous coal were tested as a function of temperature, electric-field polarization, and direction of the coal samples. There were slight decreases in the dielectric constant and conductivity of coal as a function of temperature from ambient up to 700\u00b0F. However, there were significant variations in the conductivity as a function of polarization, with the vertical polarization possessing lower conductivity. Only slight changes in conductivity were detected as a function of direction, with the face cleats exhibiting somewhat higher losses. The dielectric constant remained essentially constant as a function of polarization and direction of the electromagnetic wave. Measurements of electrical properties of coal were also made in the 0.5-100-MHz region using capacitance techniques. In general, there was a decrease in the values of dielectric constant and an increase in conductivity as the frequency increased.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic wave polarization","Electromagnetic scattering","Temperature","Conductivity","Dielectric constant","Face detection","Monitoring","Microwave frequencies","Solids","Testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGE.1978.294591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071935/04071944.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1978.294591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Properties of Eastern Bituminous Coal as a Function of Frequency, Polarization and Direction of the Electromagnetic Wave, and Temperature of the Sample","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4071944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Properties of Eastern Bituminous Coal as a Function of Frequency, Polarization and Direction of the Electromagnetic Wave, and Temperature of the Sample","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071944/","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1978","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Properties of Eastern Bituminous Coal as a Function of Frequency, Polarization and Direction of the Electromagnetic Wave, and Temperature of the Sample","sourcePdf":"TGE-v16-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043444S","chronDate":"Oct.  1978","isNumber":"4071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4071944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":4071946,"authors":[{"name":"Stanley C.

A complete investigation, including skin effect, reveals that the contribution of the skin effect is adequately compensated for by boosting the induction-log signal by the amount of skin effect that would be expected if the sonde were surrounded by a homogeneous medium. Thus a geometrical-factor-type theory is sufficiently general to account for the effect of eccentricity of the sonde position in the borehole. The theoretical equations developed are applied to a focused induction-logging tool with a medium depth of investigation (ILm) and a focused induction-logging tool with deep investigation (ILd). The results are found to be in fair agreement with experimental results. Some disparity in the two sets of results can be attributed to the effect of the finite size of the mandrel, which is not taken into account in the theoretical development.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Sonde Eccentricity on Responses of Conventional Induction-Logging Tools","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1978.294593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071935/04071946.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1978.294593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4071946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Sonde Eccentricity on Responses of Conventional Induction-Logging Tools","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Sonde Eccentricity on Responses of Conventional Induction-Logging Tools","sourcePdf":"TGE-v16-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037851S","chronDate":"Oct.  1978","isNumber":"4071935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4071946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4071968,"authors":[{"name":"Fawwaz T.

It is shown that the highest correlation between \u03c3\u00b0 and soil moisture is 0.92 for the combined response of four crop types measured at 4.25 GHz, 10\u00b0 incidence angle, and HH polarization. Radar look direction, relative to the crop row direction, is shown to have an insignificant effect on soil moisture estimation if the radar frequency is higher than 4 GHz. The dependence on soil type can be minimized by expressing soil moisture in units of percent of field capacity. The possibility of using a single radar for measuring soil moisture for both bare and vegetated fields is demonstrated with a linear estimation algorithm having an experimental correlation coefficient of 0.8.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1979.294626","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4071963/04071968.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1979.294626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4071963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part II-Vegetation-Covered Soil","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4071968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part II-Vegetation-Covered Soil","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1979","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Backscatter Dependence on Surface Roughness, Soil Moisture, and Soil Texture: Part II-Vegetation-Covered Soil","sourcePdf":"TGE-v17-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078393S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"4071963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"125","articleId":"4071968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4071995,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan S.

This paper proposes a new MOEA that performs well on problems with a large number of objectives.

The two archives focused on convergence and diversity, respectively, in optimisation.

A chaotic genetic algorithm (CGA) is proposed to schedule jobs with uncertain operation time and flexible deadline on grid. The uncertainty is modeled by fuzzy set based execution time (FSET) model. Chaos is incorporated into standard genetic algorithm by logistic function, a simple equation involving chaos. The convergence of CGA is controlled by the three famous characteristic of logistic function: convergent, bifurcating, and chaotic during evolution. Instead of producing a single optimal solution, CGA provides a set of quasi-optimal resolutions. It's flexible for users to make the final decision according to their preferences. In order to evaluate the performance of CGA, an entropy based statistical method is introduced.

Their applicability depends on the availability of the underlying network bandwidth. However, network resources are shared and the available network bandwidth varies with time. There is no satisfactory solution available for network performance predictions. This lack of prediction limits the applicability of network-based computing, especially for grid computing where concurrent remote processing is essential. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN) based approach for network performance prediction. The ANN mechanism has been tested on classical trace files and compared with the well-known system NWS (Network Weather Service) for performance. Experimental results show the ANN approach always provides an improved prediction over that of NWS","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294150","startPage":"333","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072024","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4072023/4072024/04072103.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A New Predictive Mechanism Based on Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072103/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A New Predictive Mechanism Based on Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"9308906","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A New Predictive Mechanism Based on Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCIAS-1-79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091512S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2006","isNumber":"4072024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4072023","articleId":"4072103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4072106,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchao Zeng","affiliation":["Divison of System Simulation & Computer Application, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274478800"},{"name":"Jing Jie","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jie","id":"37267563500"},{"name":"Jianxiu Hu","affiliation":["Divison of System Simulation & Computer Application, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Jianxiu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37856168700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0604-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0605-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4072106","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072106","abstract":"In order to improve the global convergent ability of the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO), the paper develops a new version of particle swarm optimization guided by the acceleration information (AGPSO).

The proposed method possesses distinctive properties of Lyapunov theory-based adaptive filtering (LAF) in Seng Kah Phooi et. al, (2002). This method is different from many RBF NN training methods using gradient search techniques. A new Lyapunov function of the error between the desired output and the RBF NN output is first defined. The output asymptotically converges to the desired output by proper design of the weight adaptation law in Lyapunov sense. In this paper, we have proved that the design is independent of statistic properties of the input and output signals. The proposed method has better tracking capability compared with the LAF.

After extracting Gabor face representations for every face sample, a kernel PCA with fractional power polynomial models is chosen to extract high-order statistical features of extracted Gabor face representations. At last, a new IRBF neural network is built to classify these extracted high-order statistical features of Gabor face representations. According to the experiments on the famous CAS-PEAL face database, our proposed approach could outperform PCA, ICA with architecture II (ICA2) and kernel PCA (KPCA) with standing testing sets proposed in the current release disk of the CAS-PEAL face database","doi":"10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294223","startPage":"690","endPage":"695","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4072023/4072024/04072176.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Model for Independent RBF Neural Networks Employing Gabor-based Kernel PCA with Fractional Power Polynomial Models for Feature Extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Kernel","Principal component analysis","Polynomials","Feature extraction","Spatial databases","Gabor filters","Frequency","Lighting","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image representation","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent RBF neural networks","Gabor-based kernel PCA","fractional power polynomial model","feature extraction","radial basis function network","Gabor filter","Gabor face representation","face recognition","high-order statistical features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Model for Independent RBF Neural Networks Employing Gabor-based Kernel PCA with Fractional Power Polynomial Models for Feature Extraction","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4072176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308948","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Model for Independent RBF Neural Networks Employing Gabor-based Kernel PCA with Fractional Power Polynomial Models for Feature Extraction","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCIAS-1-152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062807S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4072023","isNumber":"4072024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4072023","xplore-issue":"4072024","articleId":"4072176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4072217,"authors":[{"name":"Dong You Choi","affiliation":["Division of Electronics & Information Engineering, Cheongju University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong You","lastName":"Choi","id":"38258001200"},{"name":"Kwan Houng Lee","affiliation":["Division of Electronics & Information Engineering, Cheongju University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwan Houng","lastName":"Lee","id":"38254234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0604-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0605-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4072217","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Base stations","Shape","Structural beams","Interference","Frequency","Antenna radiation patterns","Information analysis","Directional antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell sectorization","CDMA mobile communication channels","wide-beam three sector cell","narrow-beam three sector cell"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, in order to efficient cell sector and to improve the Ec/Io of the pilot channel in CDMA mobile communication systems, we analyze and compare the wide-beam three sector cell (WTSC) with the narrow-beam three sector cell (NTSC) as a method for cell sectorization.

Soil texture is shown to have an effect on dielectric behavior over the entire frequency range and is most pronounced at frequencies below 5 GHz. In addition, the dielectric properties of frozen soils suggest that a fraction of the soil water component remains liquid even at temperatures of -24\u00b0 C. The dielectric data as measured at room temperature are summarized at each frequency by polynomial expressions dependent upon both the volumetric moisture content m and the percentage of sand and clay contained in the soil; separate polynomial expressions are given for the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. In Part II, two dielectric mixing models will be presented to account for the observed behavior: 1) a semiempirical refractive mixing model that accurately describes the data and requires only volumetric moisture and soil texture as inputs, and 2) a theoretical four-component mixing model that explicitly accounts for the presence of bound water.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072232/04072239.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1985.289497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1985.289497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Dielectric Behavior of Wet Soil-Part 1: Empirical Models and Experimental Observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric constant","Dielectric measurements","Frequency measurement","Soil measurements","Soil texture","Dielectric liquids","Temperature dependence","Temperature measurement","Polynomials","Moisture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Dielectric Behavior of Wet Soil-Part 1: Empirical Models and Experimental Observations","volume":"GE-23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Dielectric Behavior of Wet Soil-Part 1: Empirical Models and Experimental Observations","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-23-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105967S","chronDate":"Jan.  1985","isNumber":"4072232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"802","articleId":"4072239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4072240,"authors":[{"name":"Myron C.

Part II draws upon the data presented in Part 1 [13] to develop appropriate empirical and theoretical dielectric mixing models for the 1.4-to 18-GHz region. A semiempirical mixing model based upon the index of refraction is presented, requiring only easily ascertained soil physical parameters such as volumetric moisture and soil textural composition as inputs. In addition, a theoretical model accounting explicitly for the presence of a hydration layer of bound water adjacent to hydrophilic soil particle surfaces is presented. A four-component dielectric mixing model treats the soil-water system as a host medium of dry soil solids containing randomly distributed and randomly oriented disc-shaped inclusions of bound water, bulk water, and air. The bulk water component is considered to be dependent upon frequency, temperature, and salinity. The soil solution is differentiated by means of a soil physical model into 1) a bound component and 2) a bulk soil solution. The performance of each model is evaluated as a function of soil moisture, soil texture, and frequency, using the dielectric measurements of five soils ranging from sandy loam to silty clay (as presented in Part I [13]) at frequencies between 1.4 and 18 GHz. The semiempirical mixing model yields an excellent fit to the measured data at frequencies above 4 GHz.

In this paper, we present a new alignment procedure in which the time shifts necessary to align simultaneously an ensemble of signals are determined through a parameter-optimization problem in the discretefrequency omain. A comparison of this procedure with the parabolic fit procedure is performed on synthetic data with various levels of signal-to-noise ratios.

The 3-D measurements consist of countrates at 30 energies and 128 angles evenly distributed over the 4xr solid-angle sphere. The energy range is 15 eV-30 keV for electrons and 20 eV/q-40 keV/q for ions. The RPA extends the electron measurements to lower energies. Three microcomputers within the experinent perform extensive on-board data-processing functions.

The canopy model, although one-dimensional, is able to reproduce typical canopy features like the \"bowl shape\" and the canopy \"hot spot.\" In the decoupled mode, it can be used to compute canopy-equivalent BRDF's. The atmospheric perturbation of the angular reflectance pattern of a Lambertian, a mixed Lambertian/specular BRDF, and of the measured BRDF's of savannah and coniferous forest canopies is studied using one aerosol-free and two polluted atmospheres with surface visual ranges of V0 = 23 km and V0 = 5 km. It is shown that for surface albedoes > 10%, local extremes in the angular distribution of the surface reflectance and dependencies on the view azimuth angle are still detectable above the atmosphere and are nearly invariant to atmospheric perturbations. This result leads to the recommendation that off-nadir satellite observations in the near-infrared may contribute additional valuable information to crop identification. However, canopy reflectance variations with varying view zenith angles are dominated by atmospheric perturbations even for relatively clear atmospheres.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1985.289383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072348","startPage":"648","endPage":"658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072348/04072359.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote Sensing of Angular Characteristics of Canopy Reflectances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Remote Sensing of Angular Characteristics of Canopy Reflectances","publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"GE-23","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Sensing of Angular Characteristics of Canopy Reflectances","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-23-n5-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039793S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"4072348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4072359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4072365,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowen Li","affiliation":["Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Department of Geology andGeography,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Li","id":"37280864300"},{"name":"Alan H.

The model is driven by interpixel variance generated from three sources: 1) the number of crowns in the pixel; 2) the size of individual crowns; and 3) overlapping of crowns and shadows. The model uses parallel-ray geometry to describe the illumination of a three-dimensional cone and the shadow it casts. Cones are assumed to be randomly placed and may overlap freely. Cone size (height) is distributed lognormally, and cone form, described by the apex angle of the cone, is-fixed in the model but allowed to vary in its application. The model can also be inverted to provide estimates of the size, shape, and spacing of the conifers as cones using remote imagery and a minimum of ground measurements. Field tests using both 10-and 80-m multispectral imagery of two test conifer stands in northeastern California produced reasonable estimates for these parameters. The model appears to be sufficiently general and robust for application to other geometric shapes and mixtures of simple shapes. Thus it has wide potential use not only in remote sensing of vegetation, but also in other remote sensing situations in which discrete objects are imaged at resolutions sufficiently coarje that they canot be resolved individually.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072348/04072365.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1985.289389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1985.289389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric-Optical Modeling of a Conifer Forest Canopy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Shape measurement","Testing","Remote sensing","Image resolution","Casting","Geometry","Lighting","Size measurement","Multispectral imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Plant canopy model","remote sensing","forest reflectance modeling","geometric probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Geometric-Optical Modeling of a Conifer Forest Canopy","volume":"GE-23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric-Optical Modeling of a Conifer Forest Canopy","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-23-n5-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053908S","chronDate":"Sept.  1985","isNumber":"4072348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"335","articleId":"4072365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4072415,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Schmugge","affiliation":["Sapce and Earth Sciences Directorate, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schmugge","id":"37295379300"},{"name":"Peggy E.

Seasat SAR imagery of Oklahoma was used to evaluate the textural autocorrelation function of five land-use categories: water, forest, pasture, urban, and cultivated. It was found that the maximum classification accuracy achievable using first-order statistics was 72 percent and that this level of accuracy was obtainable only by significantly degrading the spatial resolution in order to increase the number of independent samples per pixel. In contrast, second-order statistics-specifically, image contrast and inverse moment-provided a classification accuracy of 88 percent, with only a modest degradation in spatial resolution. A second study using SIR-A imagery of five forested regions has shown that the use of textural information can improve the classification accuracy among the five forest types from 75 to 93 percent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072439/04072450.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1986.289643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1986.289643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Textural Infornation in SAR Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Fading","Radar imaging","Speckle","Spatial resolution","Layout","Autocorrelation","Degradation","Spaceborne radar","Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"Textural Infornation in SAR Images","volume":"GE-24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textural Infornation in SAR Images","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-24-n2-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054656S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4072439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"405","articleId":"4072450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4072454,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel S.

Canopy characteristics were measured on the ground. The reflectance distributions are reported and compared to the scattering behavior of agricultural and natural grassland canopies. In addition, the three-dimensional radiative transfer model of Kimes was used to document the unique radiant transfers that take place in forest canopies due to their special geometric structure. Measurements and model simulations showed that the scattering behavior of relatively dense forest canopies is similar to the scattering behavior of agricultural crops and natural grasslands. Only in more sparse forest canopies with significant spacing between the tree crowns (or clumps of tree crowns) does the scattering behavior deviate from homogeneous agricultural and natural grassland canopies. This clumping of vegetation material has two effects on the radiant transfers within the canopy: A) it increases the probability of gap to the understory and/or soil layers that increases the influence of the scattering properties of these lower layers; and B) it increases the number of low transmitting clumps of vegetation within the scene causing increased backscatter and decreased forward scatter to occur relative to the homogeneous case. Both effects, referred to as phenomenon A and B, respectively, tend to increase backscatter relative to forward scatter.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1986.289647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072439/04072454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1986.289647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072439","startPage":"281","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional Reflectance Distributions of a Hardwood and Pine Forest Canopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Directional Reflectance Distributions of a Hardwood and Pine Forest Canopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072454/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"GE-24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional Reflectance Distributions of a Hardwood and Pine Forest Canopy","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-24-n2-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044144S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4072439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"139","articleId":"4072454","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4072476,"authors":[{"name":"Ardeshir Goshtasby","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Ardeshir","lastName":"Goshtasby","id":"37354975600"},{"name":"George C.

Interpretation of SIR-A images by McCauley et al. [1], [2] dramatically changed previous concepts of the role that fluvial processes have played over the past 10000 to 30000000 years in shaping this now extremely flat, featureless, and hyperarid landscape. In the present paper we summarize the near-surface stratigraphy, the electrical properties of materials, and the types of radar interfaces found to be responsible for different classes of SIR-A tonal response. The dominant factors related to efficient microwave signal penetration into the sediment blanket include a) favorable distribution of particle sizes, b) extremely low moisture content and c) reduced geometric scattering at the SIR-A frequency (1.3 GHz). The depth of signal penetration that results in a recorded backscatter, here called \"radar imaging depth,\" was documented in the field to be a maximum of 1.5 m, or 0.25 of the calculated \"skin depth,\" for the sediment blanket. Radar imaging depth is estimated to be between 2 and 3 m for active sand dune materials. Diverse permittivity interfaces and volume scatterers within the shallow subsurface are responsible for most of the observed backscatter not directly attributable to grazing outcrops.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","volume":"GE-24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Shuttle Imaging Radar: Physical Controls on Signal Penetration and Subsurface Scattenng in the Eastern Sahara","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shuttle Imaging Radar: Physical Controls on Signal Penetration and Subsurface Scattenng in the Eastern Sahara","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-24-n4-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057601S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4072487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"96","articleId":"4072512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4072513,"authors":[{"name":"John F.

The alluvial fill in some of the RR-1 valleys gives a locally intermediate to bright response where cemented by diagenetic CaCO3 (caliche). The RR-2 type (braided channels inset in the RR-1 valleys) are filled with noncalichified, loose sediment, and are visible on SIR because of the \"caliche effect\"-the dark response of unconsolidated alluvium in the inset channels contrasts with the brighter response of calichified alluvium in the broad valleys. The third type, RR-3 (narrow, long, bedrock-incised channels), which are partly visible on the ground and on Landsat in areas where the sand sheet is patchy, are conspicuous on SIR because the dark response of their unconsolidated channel fill contrasts with the brighter response of the surrounding bedrock.

Remote measurement of the surface characteristics is perturbed by atmospheric scattering of sun light. This scattering tends to smooth the angular dependence of non-Lambertian surface reflectances, an effect that is not present in the case of Lambertian surfaces. This effect is calculated to test the validity of a Lambertian assumption used in remote sensing. For the three types of vegetations considered in this study, the assumption of Lambertian surface can be used satisfactorily in the derivation of surface reflectance from remotely measured radiance for a view angle outside the backscattering region. Within the backscattering region, however, the use of the assumption can result in a considerable error in the derived surface reflectance. Accuracy also deteriorates with increasing solar zenith angle. The angular distribution of the surface reflectance derived from remote measurements is smoother than that at the surface. The effect of surface non-Lambertianity on remote sensing of vegetation index is very weak. Since the effect is similar in the visible and near infrared part of the solar spectrum for the vegetations treated in this study, it is canceled in deriving the vegetation index. The effect of the diffuse skylight on surface reflectance measurements at ground level is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1986.289617","startPage":"699","endPage":"708","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072517/04072527.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1986.289617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Lambertian Effects on Remote Sensing of Surface Reflectance and Vegetation Index","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Remote sensing","Reflectivity","Vegetation","Surface treatment","Light scattering","Backscatter","Optical reflection","Satellites","Atmospheric measurements","Sun"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Non-Lambertian Effects on Remote Sensing of Surface Reflectance and Vegetation Index","volume":"GE-24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Lambertian Effects on Remote Sensing of Surface Reflectance and Vegetation Index","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-24-n5-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085566S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4072517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"120","articleId":"4072527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4072538,"authors":[{"name":"Hooshmand M.

The cones are first presumed to be solid dark gray Lambertian objects, located on a lighter gray Lambertian background. To add realism, \"translucence\" is added and light is allowed to pass through cones with negative exponential attenuation.

In some cases the Doppler centroid can be sufficiently determined using available information regarding the terrain topography, the relative motion between the sensor and the terrain, and the antenna pointing direction. But most often, a highly accurate Doppler centroid value has to be derived by analyzing the received SAR signal itself. This kind of signal processing is referred to as Doppler centroid estimation (DCE). This correspondence briefly describes two DCE algorithms, provides a performance summary for these algorithms, and presents the experimental results. These algorithms include a previously reported one and a newly developed one that is optimized for quasi-homogeneous sources. The performance enhancement achieved by the optimal DCE algorithm is clearly demonstrated by the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1986.289568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072543/04072577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1986.289568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072543","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Doppler Centroid Estimation for SAR Data from a Quasi-Homogeneous Source","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Doppler Centroid Estimation for SAR Data from a Quasi-Homogeneous Source","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"GE-24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Doppler Centroid Estimation for SAR Data from a Quasi-Homogeneous Source","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-24-n6-34.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029291S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4072543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"52","articleId":"4072577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4072600,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-tseng Wu","affiliation":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Shih-tseng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37069268600"},{"name":"Steven A.

The ratioed data are linearly stretched to yield a digital number within a range of 0 to 255. The techniques for reducing SAR speckle noise and for measuring the degree of separation are discussed. For surface feature delineation, the results indicate that cross polarization as well as cross polarization ratioed data better delineate those surface features that are difficult to separate by like polarization data. The results suggest using a median value filtering technique to reduce within-plot data fluctuation to increase the separability measure.

The proposed dielectric model is found to give excellent agreement with data over a wide range of moisture conditions and over the entire 0.2-20 GHz range examined in this study.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1987.289833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072678","startPage":"550","endPage":"557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072678/04072685.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Dielectric Spectrum of Vegetation - Part II: Dual-Dispersion Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Microwave Dielectric Spectrum of Vegetation - Part II: Dual-Dispersion Model","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"GE-25","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Dielectric Spectrum of Vegetation - Part II: Dual-Dispersion Model","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-25-n5-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023897S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"4072678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"338","articleId":"4072685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4072692,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

The analyses are based on both theoretical and experimental considerations at the frequencies of 1.4, 5.0, and 10.7 GHz. Radiative transfer calculations of microwave emissivities at these frequencies are performed with a number of moisture profiles measured for two soils. The calculated emissivities are compared with those derived from the Fresnel equation to deduce the microwave sampling depth in soils. The data acquired from the ground-level radiometric measurements during the summers of 1979-1981 are examined and compared with the theoretical retical analysis. Both theoretical and experimental analyses lead to the conclusion that the microwave sampling depth in soils is about one tenth of the wavelength of observation. It is shown that the moisture content at any depth near the surface of a smooth soil can be estimated, in principle, by a combination of a radiometric measurement and a curve generated by the Fresnel equation at an appropriate frequency, provided that the texture of the soil is known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","volume":"GE-25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Emission from Smooth Bare Fields and Soil Moisture Sampling Depth","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Emission from Smooth Bare Fields and Soil Moisture Sampling Depth","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-25-n5-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032815S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"4072678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"52","articleId":"4072692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4072710,"authors":[{"name":"Norbert Bartsch","affiliation":["Institut fuer Hochfrequenztechnik, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Bartsch","id":"37843683800"},{"name":"Konrad Gruner","affiliation":["Institut fuer Hochfrequenztechnik, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Gruner","id":"37298613400"},{"name":"Wolfgang Keydel","affiliation":["Institut fuer Hochfrequenztechnik, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Keydel","id":"37297329200"},{"name":"Franz Witte","affiliation":["Institut fuer Hochfrequenztechnik, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Witte","id":"37089053517"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"4072710","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Microwave radiometry","Petroleum","Oil pollution","Radiometers","Sea surface","Marine vehicles","L-band","Microwave sensors","Instruments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072710","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1987.289737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1987.289737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072700/04072710.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contributions to Oil-Spill Detection and Analysis with Radar and Microwave Radiometry: Results of the Archimedes II Campaign","abstract":"During the Archimedes II campaign in November 1985 (conducted and sponsored by JRC ISPRA) different DFVLR-instruments were flown, an X-band SLAR, an elementary L-band SAR, and microwaveradiometers at 32 and 90 GHz.

The snow types ranged from newly fallen snow to refrozen snow, and the density and mean grain size varied from 0.17 to 0.39 g/cm3 and from 0.2 to 1.6 mm, respectively. From measurements of the transmission loss as a function of sample thickness at a temperature of -15\u00b0C, the extinction coefficient and the surface scattering loss (due to surface roughness at the front and back surfaces of the snow slab) were determined for each snow type. The experimental values were compared against theoretical results computed according to the strong fluctuation theory. In general, good agreement with the experimental data was obtained at 18, 35, and 60 GHz when the grain size used in the theoretical calculations was chosen to be slightly smaller than the observed snow-particle size. However, the extinction coefficient of large-grained refrozen snow as predicted by the strong fluctuation theory is much larger at 90 GHz than the values determined experimentally. The attenuation in snow was observed to increase only slightly with increasing temperature in the -35 to -1\u00b0C range.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1987.289743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1987.289743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072700","startPage":"737","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4072700/04072716.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Snow","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Grain size","Propagation losses","Extinction coefficients","Fluctuations","Loss measurement","Thickness measurement","Temperature"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extinction Behavior of Dry Snow in the 18-to 90-GHz Range","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"GE-25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extinction Behavior of Dry Snow in the 18-to 90-GHz Range","sourcePdf":"TGRS-vGE-25-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027917S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"4072700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"140","articleId":"4072716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4072724,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Mohn","affiliation":["Norwegian Computing Centre, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Mohn","id":"38115727800"},{"name":"Nils L.

The k-means clustering method first partitions the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, we build an ID3 decision tree. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the subgroups within the cluster. To obtain a final decision on classification, the decisions of the k-means and ID3 methods are combined using two rules: 1) the nearest-neighbor rule and 2) the nearest-consensus rule. We perform experiments on three data sets: 1) network anomaly data (NAD), 2) Duffing equation data (DED), and 3) mechanical system data (MSD), which contain measurements from three distinct application domains of computer networks, an electronic circuit implementing a forced Duffing equation, and a mechanical system, respectively. Results show that the detection accuracy of the k-means+ID3 method is as high as 96.24 percent at a false-positive-rate of 0.03 percent on NAD; the total accuracy is as high as 80.01 percent on MSD and 79.9 percent on DED","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Learning systems","Computer networks","Electronic circuits","Equations","Mechanical systems","Classification tree analysis","Clustering methods","Euclidean distance","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised anomaly detection system","k-means clustering","ID3 decision tree learning method","computer network security","Euclidean distance","network anomaly data","Duffing equation data","mechanical system data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","classification","decision trees","k-Means clustering","receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072746","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.44","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4072743/04072746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.44","startPage":"345","endPage":"354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-Means+ID3: A Novel Method for Supervised Anomaly Detection by Cascading K-Means Clustering and ID3 Decision Tree Learning Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"K-Means+ID3: A Novel Method for Supervised Anomaly Detection by Cascading K-Means Clustering and ID3 Decision Tree Learning Methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072746/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4072746/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9329264","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-Means+ID3: A Novel Method for Supervised Anomaly Detection by Cascading K-Means Clustering and ID3 Decision Tree Learning Methods","sourcePdf":"k0345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100989S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4072743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4072743","articleId":"4072746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4072747,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Fouss","affiliation":["ISYS Unit, IAG, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4072743/4072747/4072747-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fran\u00e7ois Fouss received the BS degree in management sciences in 2001 and the MS degree in information systems in 2002, both from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium.

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the \"length\" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the \"Fiedler vector,\" widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called \"statistical relational learning\" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4072743/04072747.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a Graph with Application to Collaborative Recommendation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a Graph with Application to Collaborative Recommendation","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9329265","htmlLink":"/document/4072747/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a Graph with Application to Collaborative Recommendation","sourcePdf":"k0355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139624S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4072743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"629","xplore-issue":"4072743","articleId":"4072747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4072748,"authors":[{"name":"Rudi L.

For computers, the equivalent of \"society\" is \"database,\" and the equivalent of \"use\" is \"a way to search the database\". We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted WordNet categories","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","World Wide Web","Search engines","Web sites","Data mining","Earth","Natural languages","Painting","Books","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","database management systems","search engines","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Google similarity distance","Kolmogorov complexity","search engine","database management system","hierarchical clustering","hierarchical classification","WordNet database","binary classification","support vector machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accuracy comparison with WordNet categories","automatic classification and clustering","automatic meaning discovery using Google","automatic relative semantics","automatic translation","dissimilarity semantic distance","Google search","Google distribution via page hit counts","Google code","Kolmogorov complexity","normalized compression distance (ncd)","normalized information distance (nid)","normalized Google distance (ngd)","meaning of words and phrases extracted from the Web","parameter-free data mining","universal similarity metric."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4072748","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2007.48","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4072743/04072748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2007.48","startPage":"370","endPage":"383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4072743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Google Similarity Distance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Google Similarity Distance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4072748/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","volume":"19","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4072748/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9329266","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Google Similarity Distance","sourcePdf":"k0370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13566S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4072743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"914","xplore-issue":"4072743","articleId":"4072748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4072790,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Commutations of both inverter and rectifier bridges are among the simulations detailed. Recognizing that individual commutations are of negligible importance for many phenomena, a simpler system simulation seemed feasible on the analog computer, and this was begun. Not only was the simulation improved but transient phenomena could be examined, which in real time may be of longer duration than simulated and accuracy will be retained. This is of special importance in studying electromechanical transients in parallel ac-dc power systems, especially during sudden load changes. The validity of the new simulation is established.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Direct-and Quadrature-Axis Representation of a Parallel AC and DC Power System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1966.291660","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073006/04073013.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1966.291660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4073013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1966","displayDocTitle":"A Direct-and Quadrature-Axis Representation of a Parallel AC and DC Power System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-85","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 1966","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Direct-and Quadrature-Axis Representation of a Parallel AC and DC Power System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-85-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034404S","chronDate":"March  1966","isNumber":"4073006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4073013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4073020,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Effects of excitation and prime mover power controls are included making the program a valuable tool for the equipment designer.

This general problem is particularized to the minimization of transmission line losses by suitable selection of the reactive productions and transformer tap settings. An efficient computational procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method for solving the power-flow equations and on the dual (Lagrangian) variables of the Kuhn and Tucker theorem is discussed. This minimization procedure has been applied successfully to a 500-node system studied by the Bonneville Power Administration for which an effective power-flow program had been developed previously. The dual variables associated with the primary (electrical) variables are obtained in the course of the computation, and their engineering significance for power system design and tariffication is emphasized. The procedure has been extended to the general case of combined active and reactive optimization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Control of Reactive Power Flow","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1968.292254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073408/04073416.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1968.292254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073408","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4073416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Control of Reactive Power Flow","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-87","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Control of Reactive Power Flow","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-87-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075015S","chronDate":"Jan.  1968","isNumber":"4073408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4073416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4073433,"authors":[{"name":"Paul L.

Since phasor and complex impedance concepts are not incorporated, the theory of multiple reference frames permits a convenient and simple method of analyzing steady-state modes of unbalanced or nonsinusoidal operation which have heretofore been limited to analysis by the method of symmetrical components.

This problem arises when transmission line or generation outages cause bus voltage magnitudes to decrease below desirable limits. The problem of selecting where and how much kilovar capacity is required has many feasible solutions which satisfy the conditions imposed. A method for locating that solution with the minimum total installed capacity is presented. This nonlinear programming problem will be solved by using a linear approximation, solving the linear programming problem, and then correcting the linear approximation through the use of differences between the linear and nonlinear results.

Extensions to multiple periods and to include additional constraints such as time dependent start-up costs and geographic constraints are given.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1968.292156","startPage":"1968","endPage":"1978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1968.292156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073480","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073480/04073484.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Mixed-Integer Programming Duality to Scheduling Thermal Generating Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073484/","displayDocTitle":"An Application of Mixed-Integer Programming Duality to Scheduling Thermal Generating Systems","volume":"PAS-87","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of Mixed-Integer Programming Duality to Scheduling Thermal Generating Systems","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-87-n12-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027701S","chronDate":"Dec.  1968","isNumber":"4073480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"128","articleId":"4073484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4073487,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson E.

It appears logical and desirable to utilize and extend the methodology of optimum dispatching to problems encountered during abnormal operating conditions. This paper, as a first step in that direction, discusses a systematic approach toward minimizing the curtailment of service in a power system after a severe fault. The problem of minimizing load curtailment under a given set of emergency conditions is formulated as a problem of static optimization, subject to operational and equipment constraints. First, a feasible steady-state solution is obtained for the postfault network configuration. Starting from this initial feasible solution, the optinum (minimum curtailment) is approached by a gradient technique. An efficient computational procedure is based on the Newton-Raphson technique for solving the power flow equations, and the Kuhn-Tucker theorem for the optimization. The analytical results are verified on a 26-node example problem. Two typical emergency situations are considered: the loss of generation and the loss of an interconnection tie line. The same optimization procedure and the computed dual (Lagrangian) variables can be utilized for computer programs involving optimum service restoration, generation reserve scheduling, and system expansion studies.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1968.292194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1968.292194","startPage":"784","endPage":"795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073536/04073564.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Load-Shedding Policy for Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1968","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Load-Shedding Policy for Power Systems","publicationDate":"March 1968","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","volume":"PAS-87","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073564/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Load-Shedding Policy for Power Systems","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-87-n3-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030582S","chronDate":"March  1968","isNumber":"4073536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4073564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4073569,"authors":[{"name":"John M.

Recently, a new method by Powell for constrained minimization has claimed a better performance than existing methods. An investigation was carried out to test Powell's method on optimal load flow problems and results obtained confirm expectations. Powell's method and its accompanying Fletcher-Powell method, which performs the actual minimizations, are presented. The power system optimal load flow problem is discussed, and its equations are presented in the form required by the nonlinear programming approach. Finally, a numerical example on the IEEE 30- bus standard test system is presented in which an economic dispatching is accomplished with the new method. Computation time is small enough to permit the application of the method for dispatching at practical intervals of time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Use of the Powell and Fletcher - Powell Nonlinear Programming Methods for Optimal Load Flows","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1969.292281","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073738/04073748.pdf","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1969.292281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4073748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","displayDocTitle":"Combined Use of the Powell and Fletcher - Powell Nonlinear Programming Methods for Optimal Load Flows","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-88","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Use of the Powell and Fletcher - Powell Nonlinear Programming Methods for Optimal Load Flows","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-88-n10-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057494S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4073738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4073748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4073750,"authors":[{"name":"Ichiro Hano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ichiro","lastName":"Hano","id":"38132093500"},{"name":"Yasuo Tamura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Tamura","id":"37290403400"},{"name":"Seinosuke Narita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Seinosuke","lastName":"Narita","id":"38116301600"},{"name":"Kimio Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kimio","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"38124781200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4073750","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":77,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Voltage control","Control systems","Reactive power control","Bridge circuits","Rectifiers","Converters","Power systems","Valves","Thyristors"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a centralized optimizing computational algorithm for the on-line control of voltage and reactive power.

A load-flow solution is shown to coincide with the minimum of a function of the power system equations. An unconstrained minimization method, developed by Fletcher-Powell, is used to solve the load-flow problem. The method always finds a solution or indicates the nonexistence of a solution. Its performance is highly independent of the reference- slack bus position and requires no acceleration factors. Several constrained minimization techniques that solve the minimum-loss and economic dispatching problems are investigated. These include the Fiacco-McCormick, Lootsma, and Zangwill methods. The technique finally recommended is shown to be an extension of the method used to solve the load-flow problem.

The application of numerical methods to obtain solutions of practical interest is discussed.

A numerical iterative method of computing this charge distribution is presented. The method is applicable to any general configuration for which the space-charge-free field can be calculated. The line- to-plane configuration is considered. A method of including the effect of conductor surface irregularities in the theoretical calculation of corona losses is outlined, and it is suggested that, by the same method, Popkov's formula may also be modified to make it applicable to lines with practical transmission-line conductors. Calculations by the method of analysis developed as well as by the modified Popkov equation are compared with experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1969.292362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073860/04073888.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1969.292362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Corona Losses on DC Transmission Lines: I - Unipolar Lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4073888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073888/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Corona Losses on DC Transmission Lines: I - Unipolar Lines","volume":"PAS-88","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Corona Losses on DC Transmission Lines: I - Unipolar Lines","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-88-n5Part-I-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056468S","chronDate":"May  1969","isNumber":"4073860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"156","articleId":"4073888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4073950,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Emphasis is placed on the influence of the control parameters upon the damping characteristics of a conventional one-field machine. Regions of instability which may occur due to improper controller design or adjustment are established. Optimization of controller parameters and the effect of controller compensation are considered. Also, the damping characteristics of a two-field machine are presented and compared with those of a one-field machine. The application of the two-field machine to damp frequency oscillations in power systems has the potential of being of practical importance. Damping by excitation control (\"forced\" damping) is compared to damping due to the action of damper windings. The advantages of forced damping are clearly established; particularly in systems where long line lengths exist between large generating units.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous machines","Damping","Machine windings","Control systems","Force control","Frequency","Power systems","Shock absorbers","Proportional control","Impedance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1969.292476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4073958/04073974.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4073958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1969.292476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous Machine Damping by Excitation Control with Direct and Quadrature Axis Field Windings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4073974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous Machine Damping by Excitation Control with Direct and Quadrature Axis Field Windings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4073974/","volume":"PAS-88","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous Machine Damping by Excitation Control with Direct and Quadrature Axis Field Windings","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-88-n8-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024179S","chronDate":"Aug.  1969","isNumber":"4073958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4073974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4074012,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-nan Yu","affiliation":["Department of ElectricalEngineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yao-nan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37292220000"},{"name":"Khien Vongsuriya","affiliation":["National Energy Authority"],"firstName":"Khien","lastName":"Vongsuriya"},{"name":"Leonard N.

This limits the method's applicability to systems of not more than about 50 nodes. This paper presents a decomposition technique that can be used in conjunction with the Fletcher-Powell method to extend the application of the nonlinear programming method to large systems. The method makes very efficient use of computer storage and has been found to reduce computation time by a factor of 90 percent for a 57-bus system.

The construction of a composite representation for the multireservoir hydroelectric power system in the Pacific Northwest is described. The composite model is based on a single measure \"potential energy\" which is indicative of the system's generating capability. This results in a one-dam representation of the multireservoir system which, in effect, receives, stores, and releases potential energy, in a statistical model for the potential energy inflow and in a generation function which relates potential energy released to actual electric power generated. It has applications in the study of different operating policies, market structures, and investment programs through simulation or optimization. As an example, it is used to obtain the net operating revenues as a function of the excess thermal in the system.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1970.292595","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074032/04074053.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1970.292595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite Representation of a Multireservoir Hydroelectric Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Composite Representation of a Multireservoir Hydroelectric Power System","volume":"PAS-89","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Representation of a Multireservoir Hydroelectric Power System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-89-n2-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030572S","chronDate":"Feb.  1970","isNumber":"4074032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"146","articleId":"4074053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4074054,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolaos V.

There have been many methods devised to compute ampacities. Moreover these methods are often quite involved and require the use of computers for their solution. The nomographic process encompasses more complex situations. It operates on the complicated nature of these formulations in a manner that reduces their complexity to a simple, accurate, and hence efficient system of computation. Intentionally, there is a vast amount of versatility built into this procedure whereby many ampacity-related parameters, for example, conductor temperature or wind velocity, may be computed easily and quickly. This development is designed to assist the reader in exploring the complete panorama of parameters or variables that manifest themselves in the science of current rating rather than in portraying a procedure needed to compute only ampere values. Furthermore, it is intended that computer programs would be used to solve problems involving a multitude of conductor sizes and/or ambient conditions, whereas the nomographic approach would, in essence, provide an analytical tool that can be drawn upon for the purposes of solving isolated ampacity problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1970.292715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074057/04074064.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"399","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1970.292715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nomographic Computation of the Ampacity Rating of Aerial Conductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1970","displayDocTitle":"Nomographic Computation of the Ampacity Rating of Aerial Conductors","volume":"PAS-89","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1970","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nomographic Computation of the Ampacity Rating of Aerial Conductors","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-89-n3Part-I-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03586S","chronDate":"March  1970","isNumber":"4074057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4074064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4074095,"authors":[{"name":"Alton D.

Various digital tests are carried out, bearing in mind in particular the nature of dc line termination at the converter stations, which may include filter circuits and a surge capacitor. It is shown that the terminal that looks inductive to a wavefront coming from the dc line is undesirable because it would cause high overvoltages at the terminal of the unfaulted pole. It is also shown that in order to reduce the risk of developing a double-pole outage from a single-pole fault, it is desirable to do away with the surge capacitor, if a suitable dc lightning arrester can be designed. Tests are presented in stages to isolate the effects of fault resistance, grid control, and line resistance. Results also indicate the restraints to be put upon the dv/dt line fault detection in order to avoid operation of this protection in the unfaulted pole.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074092/04074105.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1970.292606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1970.292606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient Overvoltage on a Bipolar HVDC Overhead Line Caused by DC Line Faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","HVDC transmission","Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Surge protection","Capacitors","Digital filters","Lightning","Arresters","Fault detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1970","displayDocTitle":"Transient Overvoltage on a Bipolar HVDC Overhead Line Caused by DC Line Faults","volume":"PAS-89","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1970","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Overvoltage on a Bipolar HVDC Overhead Line Caused by DC Line Faults","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-89-n4-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080631S","chronDate":"April  1970","isNumber":"4074092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"57","articleId":"4074105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4074106,"authors":[{"name":"Narain G.

The proposed algorithm has several advantages over the previously suggested static estimator algorithm in regard to its computational aspects, real-time implementation, and the accuracy of the estimated state.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1970.292822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074207/04074246.pdf","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1970.292822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Estimator for Tracking the State of a Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074246/","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Estimator for Tracking the State of a Power System","volume":"PAS-89","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Estimator for Tracking the State of a Power System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-89-n7-39.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024516S","chronDate":"Sept.  1970","isNumber":"4074207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"239","articleId":"4074246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4074247,"authors":[{"name":"Junichi Toyoda","affiliation":["Research Center, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Toyoda","id":"37360098200"},{"name":"Mo-shing Chen","affiliation":["Power Systems Research Center, University of Technology, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mo-shing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293278100"},{"name":"Yukiyoshi Inoue","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Itami Works, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukiyoshi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"38128126200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4074247","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":327},"abstract":"A precise short-term forecasting method for estimating the status of systems is required for on-line real-time control of complex power systems.

The objective function or the cost function is formed taking only the material cost into account. The specifications like pull out torque, starting torque etc. are put as constraint functions. These functions are expressed in terms of important dimensions of the machine which are assumed to be continuously variable. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique for nonlinear programming is used to obtain an optimum design. Analysis and synthesis programs needed for the problem have also been developed.

A comparison is made with production costs obtained from an established program. The results show that production costing can be reduced to a linear problem with little loss of accuracy. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility achieved by using Linear Programming techniques make it a desirable method of production costing for many study purposes.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1971.293113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074347/04074400.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1971.293113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Minimum Production Costs with Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074400/","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Minimum Production Costs with Linear Programming","volume":"PAS-90","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Minimum Production Costs with Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-90-n2-53.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030287S","chronDate":"March  1971","isNumber":"4074347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4074400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4074401,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this series of papers, the authors will present some of the basic principles which should be considered in the application of a load shedding and load restoration program and will describe the philosophy which led to the frequency actuated load shedding and load restoration program being implemented on the American Electric Power System. As part of this presentation, the various analytical studies which were carried out to determine the load management programs for the AEP system will be described in detail. In addition, the method of program implementation and management is presented in a companion paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1971","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1971","volume":"PAS-90","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1971","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Actuated Load Shedding and Restoration Part I - Philosophy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Actuated Load Shedding and Restoration Part I - Philosophy","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-90-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023151S","chronDate":"July  1971","isNumber":"4074479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"61","articleId":"4074484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4074522,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An integral quadratic performance index of outputs and controller inputs is minimized for impulse type disturbances occurring in the system. This gives a physically realizable control system which optimally \"stabilizes\" the excitation and input power to the synchronous machine. Numerical examples are included to show the application of the theory to a thermal and a hydraulic machine equipped with static exciters, and connected to an infinite bus. It is found that it is desirable to control a synchronous machine using both exciter and input power control gates with both power angle and speed fed back.

Solution of this equation is equivalent to minimization of a nonlinear energy functional. A recent paper has proposed approximate minimization by means of a finite element method, using triangular finite elements and a quadratically convergent iteration scheme. This new method is now applied to a 5 KW d-c machine, whose no-load and on-load characteristics are predicted and compared with experimental measurements. Good agreement is obtained. Since the pole axis is not an axis of magnetic symmetry under load, a periodicity condition is introduced to relate all magnetic vector potentials to those one pole pitch away. This condition is enforced by means of a special connection matrix, whose derivation is shown in the paper. An automatic plotting program has been developed for graphical plotting of the flux distributions, and several field plots for the machine are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074548/04074606.pdf","startPage":"2362","endPage":"2372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1971.293085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1971.293085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Element Analysis of Magnetically Saturated D-C Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Saturation magnetization","Nonlinear equations","Magnetic flux","Magnetic fields","Iron","Electric machines","Minimization","Shape"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1971","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Element Analysis of Magnetically Saturated D-C Machines","volume":"PAS-90","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Element Analysis of Magnetically Saturated D-C Machines","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-90-n5-58.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025227S","chronDate":"Sept.  1971","isNumber":"4074548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"46","articleId":"4074606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4074623,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The question arises of how to decide the weighting matrix Q of the performance function. A new method is developed in this paper to determine Q in conjunction with a left shift of the dominant eigenvalues as far as the practical controllers permit. The method is then applied to the optimal control design of a typical power system. Three cases are investigated, the first with an optimal excitation control uE, the second with optimal governor controls uG and uG, with and without the dash-pot, and the third with uE plus uG control. The stabilizing signals thus obtained are given nonlinear tests on the same power system. It is found from the results that the optimal controls are more effective than conventional excitation control, that the optimal governor control without dash-pot is just as good as the optimal excitation control, and that the optimal uE plus uG control is the best way to stabilize a power system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system control","Power systems","Optimal control","Control systems","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Closed loop systems","Matrices","Regulators","Riccati equations","System testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1972.293473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074768/04074834.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1972.293473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power System Stabilization Through Excitation and/or Governor Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power System Stabilization Through Excitation and/or Governor Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074834/","volume":"PAS-91","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power System Stabilization Through Excitation and/or Governor Control","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-91-n3-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034704S","chronDate":"May  1972","isNumber":"4074768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"111","articleId":"4074834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4074843,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Currents in excess of 15 kA at 20 kV have been interrupted by a single device in an inductive circuit. Tests are reported in which higher current were cleared by paralleling interrupters.

The maximum frequency deviation and the time at which the maximum occurs are the main quantities of interest. Two independent concepts are presented to convert a closed-loop, high dimensional, nonlinear model into approximate, open-loop, low dimensional, linear ones (the delay and the canonical models). The delay model uses pure time delay to model \"fast time constants\" and valve motion and converts the closed loop model into an open loop one. The canonical model expresses the turbine reheats respo'nse as a linear combination of a set of \"basis\" functions and provides a basis for combining many machines into one simplified, low dimensional model. The two models can be implemented concurrently, to give a very large reduction in complexity when a multi-machine system is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1972.293340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074854/04074899.pdf","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1972.293340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Equivalents for Average System Frequency Behavior Following Major Distribances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074899/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Equivalents for Average System Frequency Behavior Following Major Distribances","volume":"PAS-91","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Equivalents for Average System Frequency Behavior Following Major Distribances","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-91-n4-45.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021288S","chronDate":"July  1972","isNumber":"4074854","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"69","articleId":"4074899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4074900,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In saturated machines, however, these reactances are functions of the pre-transient load of the alternator. For more exact analyses saturated reactances should be used. The expression of rotor quantities in stator terms, or vice versa, at nonlinear condition is explained. The operational impedances Xd(p), Xq(p) and the various time constants of alternators without amortisseur windings are developed from leakage reactance concepts. After a first approximation of the transient reactances is obtained from the operational impedances, a step-by-step correction procedure is used for finding the operationally dependent direct transient reactance. This is obtained from a simulated dynamical test. Only a few step-by-step corrections are necessary to yield good values for the transient reactances. Since there is a slight difference between Xq and X'q, the analysis will concentrate only to X'd. Notations not explained here are the same as in Concordia [1]. The analysis is applied to a General Electric alternator with nameplate data 82.5 MVA, 16.5 kV, wye-connected, 40 poles and 60 Hz, described in [2].","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of Waterwheel Alternator Transient Reactances from Flux Plots","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1972.293502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4074915/04074925.pdf","startPage":"1795","endPage":"1802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1972.293502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4074915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4074925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4074925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1972","displayDocTitle":"Determination of Waterwheel Alternator Transient Reactances from Flux Plots","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-91","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of Waterwheel Alternator Transient Reactances from Flux Plots","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-91-n5-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047953S","chronDate":"Sept.  1972","isNumber":"4074915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4074925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4074942,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Also a new per-unit system is applied, as the conventional one would introduce errors if the saliency is to be taken into consideration. The external connection is considered in a general form so as to allow for studying the machine performance when it is connected to an infinite-bus through a general transmission system. The small displacement model is derived and arranged in a form suitable for investigating dynamic stability problems.

Such a machine, when operating at these loading conditions, cannot be fully utilized. In this paper, it will be shown that these limitations can be overcome by the dual-excitation of the synchronous machine. Such a dual-excited synchronous machine, when provided with appropriate schemes of excitation control, has extended dynamic stable region at any loading condition. Two modes of operation are found possible in this case. In the first, the two field windings are always equally excited, while in the second their excitation currents are adjusted so as to keep the rotor-angle fixed at a certain value independent of the loading condition. Although the first mode of operation is of advantage from the rotor heating point of view, it suffers from the drawback that the sign of the control signal for stable operation depends on the operating condition. To overcome this drawback, the second mode of operation is suggested. With this mode, the dynamic stability of the machine can be greatly improved over the whole loading range. However, since fixing the rotor-angle at a certain value necessitates unequal excitation currents in the two field windings, this mode of operation would result in unbalanced distribution of rotor heating.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1973.293625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4075027/04075069.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1973.293625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extension of the Under-Excited Stable Region of the Dual-Excited Synchronous Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4075069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4075069/","displayDocTitle":"Extension of the Under-Excited Stable Region of the Dual-Excited Synchronous Machine","volume":"PAS-92","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extension of the Under-Excited Stable Region of the Dual-Excited Synchronous Machine","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-92-n1-42.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025132S","chronDate":"Jan.  1973","isNumber":"4075027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4075069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4075114,"authors":[{"name":"Ewald F.

From this a set of curves has been plotted. Such curves can be used to reach a general conclusion about the variations of such parameters by changing the operating condition, which is an important factor in dynamic stability studies. Second, the dynamic stability of the system, as affected by different excitation, has been analyzed. The systems investigated are thyristor-type and type-I excitation systems. Their effect on dynamic stability has been compared. The results obtained by mathematical analysis have been checked by both digital and analog computer.

The method is applied to a few cases of engineering interest and compared with results of classical analysis and tests.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1974.293916","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4075313/04075323.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1974.293916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Element Solution of the Eddy-Current Problem in Magnetic Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4075323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4075323/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Element Solution of the Eddy-Current Problem in Magnetic Structures","volume":"PAS-93","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Element Solution of the Eddy-Current Problem in Magnetic Structures","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-93-n1-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030769S","chronDate":"Jan.  1974","isNumber":"4075313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"96","articleId":"4075323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4075328,"authors":[{"name":"Farid Dawalibi","affiliation":["Shawinigan Engineering Company Limited, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Dawalibi","id":"37276145300"},{"name":"Dinkar Mukhedkar","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Dinkar","lastName":"Mukhedkar","id":"37299232200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9510"}],"articleNumber":"4075328","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4075328","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Electrical resistance measurement","Soil","Probes","Conductivity","Laboratories","Reflection","Current measurement","Length measurement","Wire"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1974.293921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground Electrode Resistance Measurements in Non Uniform Soils","startPage":"109","endPage":"115","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4075313/04075328.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1974.293921","abstract":"Ground electrode resistance measurements are usually done by Fall of Potential method.

The dynamic interactions are expressed in terms of machine angles, transient voltages, and coefficients which are functions of system parameters and operation conditions. The effect of the dynamic interaction can be examined by the electric torque loci on the A6-Aw phase plane. It is found that the interaction between the mechanical modes of machines has significant effect on stability characterized by the natural mechanical oscillation frequency and damping of individual machines.","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1974.294061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4075450/04075471.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1974.294061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Interaction of Multi-Machine Power System and Excitation Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4075471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1974","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4075471/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Interaction of Multi-Machine Power System and Excitation Control","volume":"PAS-93","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1974","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Interaction of Multi-Machine Power System and Excitation Control","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-93-n4-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025879S","chronDate":"July  1974","isNumber":"4075450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4075471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4075486,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that the networks relax towards one of the stored configurations in a matter of a few refractory periods, whatever the size of the network. The relaxation time diverges in recursive networks at a critical noise Bc, above which no stored pattern can be retrieved.

A full realization of these potentials will require conscious effort to overcome obsolete rigidities, to develop unified and adaptive methods for integrating complex systems, and to increase our understanding of these systems (understanding which is vital to human productivity in developing software). How adaptive systems may be built and understood by extending control theory and statistics is discussed. Adaptive systems, like human infants, are less agile than young monkeys but have something important to contribute as they mature. It argues that the old dream of understanding intelligence in generalized terms, permitting a unified understanding of adaptive systems and of the human mind, was not incorrect; rather, the early attempts in that direction failed because they did not make full use of research possibilities in statistics, control theory, and numerical analysis (many of which are still unexploited) and were limited by hardware costs which are now coming down. A basic adaptive system derived from this approach fits the fundamental, qualitative empirical facts of human brain physiology in some detail (unlike the usual \"general neuron models,\" which rarely even discriminate between basic components of the brain), and offers opportunities for further research; it can even translate certain fundamental ideas of Freud into something more mathematical and scientific. The mathematics of the basic system, and the fit to the brain, are described in detail.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1987.289329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1987.289329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4075646/04075651.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building and Understanding Adaptive Systems: A Statistical/Numerical Approach to Factory Automation and Brain Research","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Building and Understanding Adaptive Systems: A Statistical/Numerical Approach to Factory Automation and Brain Research","volume":"17","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4075651/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building and Understanding Adaptive Systems: A Statistical/Numerical Approach to Factory Automation and Brain Research","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v17-n1-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035825S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4075646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"160","articleId":"4075651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4075652,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Monoscopic perspective projection alone is usually not sufficient to represent three-dimensional spatial information. It can, however, be improved by the adjustment of perspective parameters and by geometric visual enhancements such as reference lines and a background grid. Stereoscopic display is another method of providing three-dimensional information to the human operator. Two experiments are performed with three-axis manual tracking tasks. The first experiment investigates the effects of perspective parameters on tracking performance. The second experiment investigates the effects of visual enhancements for both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays. Results indicate that, though stereoscopic displays do generally permit superior tracking performance, monoscopic displays can allow equivalent performance when they are defined with optimal perspective parameters and provided with adequate visual enhancements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4075646/04075655.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1987.289333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1987.289333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4075655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Evaluation of Perspective and Stereoscopic Displays in Three-Axis Manual Tracking Tasks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer displays","Two dimensional displays","Three dimensional displays","Application software","TV","Humans","Graphics","User interfaces","Biomedical imaging","Biosensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4075655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Evaluation of Perspective and Stereoscopic Displays in Three-Axis Manual Tracking Tasks","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Evaluation of Perspective and Stereoscopic Displays in Three-Axis Manual Tracking Tasks","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v17-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042605S","chronDate":"Jan.  1987","isNumber":"4075646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"90","articleId":"4075655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4075677,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Lovass-Nagy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lovass-Nagy","id":"38270508000"},{"name":"R.

Through the interaction with the DM the fuzzy goals of the DM are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions, including nonlinear functions. After determining the membership functions to generate a candidate for the satisficing solution which is also Pareto optimal, if the DM specifies reference membership values, the minimax problem is solved by combined use of the bisection and linear-programming methods, and the DM is supplied with the corresponding Pareto-optimal solution together with the trade-off rates between the membership functions. Then by considering the current values of the membership functions as well as the trade-off rates, the DM responds by updating his/her reference membership values. In this way the satisficing solution for the DM can be derived efficiently from among a Pareto-optimal solution set by updating his/her reference membership values.

Facing that reality, price forecasting has an increasing impact in agents' activity. The success on bidding strategies or on price negotiation for bilateral contracts is directly dependent on the accuracy of the price forecast. However, taking decisions based only on a single forecasted value is not a good practice in risk management. The work presented in this paper makes use of artificial neural networks to find the market price for a given period, with a certain confidence level. Historical information was used to train the neural networks and the number of neural networks used is dependent of the number of clusters found on that data. K-Means clustering method is used to find clusters.

The aim is to determine the optimal dispatch schedule of the switched elements for simultaneously minimizing the energy loss and improving the voltage and power quality. Harmonics are taken into account by involving a nonlinear load in the system. The decouple approach is employed for harmonic power flow calculation and genetic algorithms are employed to effectively solve the optimization problem. Encoding ability of the proposed method enables checking the fulfillment of switching constraints of any possible schedule prior to performing calculations for non-sinusoidal conditions.

However, with wind being an uncontrollable resource and the nature of distributed wind induction generators, integrating a large-scale wind-farm into a power system poses challenges, particularly in a weak power system. In the paper, the impact of STATCOM to facilitate the integration of a large wind farm into a weak power system is studied. First, an actual weak power system with two nearby large wind farms is introduced. Based on the field SCADA data analysis, the power quality issues are highlighted and a centralized STATCOM is proposed to solve them, particularly the short-term (seconds to minutes) voltage fluctuations. Second, a model of the system, wind farm and STATCOM for steady-state and dynamic impact study is presented, and the model is validated by comparing with the actual field data.

The proposed method uses a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to forecast the hourly loads of special days. For doing that, we used hybrid Monte Carlo method. This type of learning enables us to work with simpler architecture with respect to previous works. This method was tested with actual load data of special days for the years of 2003-2004.

Virtually all of these methods are based on using statistical patterns, which are perceived between the yearly load and system marginal price (SMP) histories of the system to predict the forecasted year's power demand and SMP. The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. The proposed method introduces a system type neural network architecture to perform electricity price forecasting. Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the electricity price for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the SMP but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2006.296178","startPage":"1753","endPage":"1758","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2006.296178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075698","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4075697/4075698/04076004.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term System Marginal Price Forecasting Using System-Type Neural Network Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076004/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term System Marginal Price Forecasting Using System-Type Neural Network Architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4076004/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9463083","publicationDate":"Oct. 29-Nov. 1 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term System Marginal Price Forecasting Using System-Type Neural Network Architecture","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059389S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4075697","isNumber":"4075698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4075697","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4075698","articleId":"4076004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4076015,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Yousuf Saber","affiliation":["University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ahmed Yousuf","lastName":"Saber","id":"37394621500"},{"name":"Tomonobu Senjyu","affiliation":["University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomonobu","lastName":"Senjyu","id":"37275165700"},{"name":"Naomitsu Urasaki","affiliation":["University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Naomitsu","lastName":"Urasaki","id":"38522903500"},{"name":"Toshihisa Funabashi","affiliation":["Meidensha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihisa","lastName":"Funabashi","id":"37275181600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0178-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0177-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4076015","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076015","abstract":"This paper presents a fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) for unit commitment (UC) problem.

The parameters are tuned in order to shift the lightly damped and undamped modes under various loading conditions toward the prescribed stability region. The objective function includes system stability criteria (e.g., damping factor and damping ratio of the eigenvalues for all operating points under consideration) and boundaries of controller parameters (as constraints), enforcing their simultaneous improvement. The robustness is achieved by considering several loading conditions. The work relies on genetic algorithm (to capture the near global solution), analysis of mode observability (to select the effective feedback signal for the damping controller) and the theoretical analysis of a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB), using its modified linearized Phillips-Heffron model installed with SSSC. It is shown that the results could easily be extended for multi machine power systems. Simulation results are presented to show the fine performance of the proposed SSSC controller in damping the critical modes under different loading conditions without significantly deteriorating damping characteristics of other modes in a SMIB power system","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2006.296272","startPage":"2124","endPage":"2130","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2006.296272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4075698","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4075697/4075698/04076064.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Design of SSSC Based Robust Damping Controllers to Improve Small Signal Stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076064/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Design of SSSC Based Robust Damping Controllers to Improve Small Signal Stability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4076064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9463142","publicationDate":"Oct. 29-Nov. 1 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Optimal Design of SSSC Based Robust Damping Controllers to Improve Small Signal Stability","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0002124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095517S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4075697","isNumber":"4075698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4075697","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4075698","articleId":"4076064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4076083,"authors":[{"name":"Masatake Kawada","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Masatake Kawada received his Dr. Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1998.

In this paper, we propose a heuristic genetic scheduling algorithm to maximize system throughput while providing a level of fairness among users for non-real-time data traffic in the downlink of a multi-user OFDM system. We first formulate the resource allocation problem for rate, power, and sub-carrier allocation as an integer program in the context of a utility-based scheduling.

There is a one-way function between chaotic attractors and initial states in an overstoraged Hopfield neural network (OHNN).

Then, we regard the neural synaptic matrix as a trap door, and change it with commutative random permutation matrix. A new Diffie-Hellman public-key cryptosystem can be implemented, namely keeping the random permutation operation of the neural synaptic matrix as the secret key, and the neural synaptic matrix after permutation as public-key. In order to explain the practicability of the encryption scheme, security and encryption efficient of the scheme are discussed. The scheme of application for Internet secure communications is implemented by using Java program.

Known solutions to the mapping and routing problem first map cores onto a topology and then route communication, using separated and possibly conflicting objective functions. In this paper we present a unified single-objective algorithm, called Unified MApping, Routing and Slot allocation (UMARS). As the main contribution we show how to couple path selection, mapping of cores and TDMA time-slot allocation such that the network required to meet the constraints of the application is minimized. The time-complexity of UMARS is low and experimental results indicate a run-time only 20% higher than that of path selection alone. We apply the algorithm to an MPEG decoder System-on-Chip (SoC), reducing area by 33%, power by 35% and worst-case latency by a factor four over a traditional multi-step approach.","doi":"10.1145/1084834.1084857","publicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076298/4076299/04076316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1084834.1084857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076299","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to constrained mapping and routing on network-on-chip architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to constrained mapping and routing on network-on-chip architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076316/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4076316/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to constrained mapping and routing on network-on-chip architectures","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"28240075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110365S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4076298","isNumber":"4076299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076298","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4076299","articleId":"4076316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4076331,"authors":[{"name":"Tulika Mitra","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tulika","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37282510200"},{"name":"Pan Yu","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37276795200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-161-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4076331","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Embedded system","Frequency","Computer aided instruction","Permission","Processor scheduling","Clocks","Timing","Integer linear programming","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["customizable processors","execution time","instruction-set extensions","real-time systems","worst-case"]}],"abstract":"Instruction-set extensible processors allow an existing processor core to be extended with application-specific custom instructions. In this paper, we explore a novel application of instruction-set extensions to meet timing constraints in real-time embedded systems. In order to satisfy real-time constraints, the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a task should be reduced as opposed to its average-case execution time. Unfortunately, existing custom instruction selection techniques based on average-case profile information may not reduce a task's WCET. We first develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to choose optimal instruction-set extensions for reducing the WCET. However, ILP solutions for this problem are often too expensive to compute. Therefore, we also propose an efficient and scalable heuristic that obtains quite close to the optimal results. Experiment results indicate that suitable choice of custom instructions can reduce the WCET of our benchmark programs by as much as 42% (23.5% on an average).","doi":"10.1145/1084834.1084879","publicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076298/4076299/04076331.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1084834.1084879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076299","startPage":"166","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satisfying real-time constraints with custom instructions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Satisfying real-time constraints with custom instructions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076331/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4076331/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satisfying real-time constraints with custom instructions","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"28240166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080805S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4076298","isNumber":"4076299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076298","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4076299","articleId":"4076331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4076332,"authors":[{"name":"Can Ozturan","affiliation":["Department of computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Ozturan","id":"37606353100"},{"name":"Gunhan Dundar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gunhan","lastName":"Dundar","id":"37283762300"},{"name":"Kubilay Atasu","affiliation":["Department of computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kubilay","lastName":"Atasu","id":"37282505100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-161-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4076332","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integer linear programming","Computer aided instruction","Computer architecture","Application specific processors","Delay","Embedded computing","Iterative algorithms","Embedded system","Application software","Costs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIPs","extensible processors","integer linear","programming"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach to the instruction-set extension identification problem.

The design philosophy of the Blue Gene/L architecture relies on large numbers of power efficient nodes (whose technology is derived from the world of embedded microprocessors) to enable packing of many such nodes into a small volume to achieve high performance. In order for an application to exploit the potential of this architecture, the application must scale well to large node counts. Because the scientific goals of the project entail simulating very long time-scales, up to microseconds, strong scaling of a fixed size problem to these large node counts is a requirement. In pursuit of this objective we have considered a variety of parallel decompositions and explored ways to exploit and map algorithms onto the two primary high performance interconnects provided by the Blue Gene architecture, the 3D-torus network and the collective network. Our current version of the application continues to speed up through 4096 nodes and is being used for studies of a protein/lipid system (for which some results have already been published) and for protein folding/unfolding simulations.","doi":"10.1145/1084834.1084888","publicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Third IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076298/4076299/04076338.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1084834.1084888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blue matter on blue gene/L: massively parallel computation for biomolecular simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076338/","displayDocTitle":"Blue matter on blue gene/L: massively parallel computation for biomolecular simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4076338/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blue matter on blue gene/L: massively parallel computation for biomolecular simulation","confLoc":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"28240207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068087S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4076298","isNumber":"4076299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076298","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4076299","articleId":"4076338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4076339,"authors":[{"name":"James P.

In this paper, we explore automated synthesis of high bit-width unsigned integer multiplier circuits by defining and validating an estimator function used in search and analysis of the design space of such circuits. We focus on analysis of a hybrid hierarchical multiplier scheme that combines the throughput advantages of parallel multipliers and the resource cost-effectiveness of serial ones. We present an analytical model that rapidly predicts timing and resource usage for selected model candidates. We evaluate the estimator model in the design of a practical application, a 256-bit elliptic curve adder implemented on a Xilinx FPGA fabric.

This paper describes the results of an empirical analysis of Wikipedia and discusses ways in which the Wikipedia community has evolved as it has grown. We contrast our findings with an earlier study and present three main results. First, the community maintains a strong resilience to malicious editing, despite tremendous growth and high traffic. Second, the fastest growing areas of Wikipedia are devoted to coordination and organization. Finally, we focus on a particular set of pages used to coordinate work, the \"Talk\" pages. By manually coding the content of a subset of these pages, we find that these pages serve many purposes, notably supporting strategic planning of edits and enforcement of standard guidelines and conventions.

Preventing unknown attacks and Internet worms has led to a need for application level network anomaly detection. Payload based detection schemes in experiments are often misleading. In this paper, we discuss the problems associated with the experimental results. In the first section, a brief review would be given for application level anomaly detection research. Introduction to several major payload based approaches would be given in section 2. Then we use the DARPA '99 dataset to evaluate the ALAD mechanism, and discuss the problems by using original DARPA '99 datasets for evaluation. In the fourth section, an improved method would be proposed with a focus on detecting payload related attacks. In section 5, we demonstrate how to justify the payload based detection mechanism using the DARPA '99 dataset, and compare with ALAD to demonstrate its advantages","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076361/4076362/04076570.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2007.75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2007.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Payload Based Application level Network Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Intrusion detection","Fingerprint recognition","Protocols","Data mining","Application software","Telecommunication traffic","Computer science","IP networks","Computer worms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["payload based application level network anomaly detection","packet header fields","Internet worms","DARPA 99 dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Payload Based Application level Network Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4076570/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9364603","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Payload Based Application level Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"27550099a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051711S","chronDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4076361","isNumber":"4076362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076361","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4076362","articleId":"4076570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4076598,"authors":[{"name":"Marian Anghel","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Anghel","id":"37418914200"},{"name":"Kenneth A.

We use a linear approximation to the network flow equations and apply linear programming techniques that optimize the dispatching of generators and loads in order to eliminate the network overloads associated with a damaged system. We also provide a simple model for the operator's response to various contingency events that is not always optimal due to either failure of the state estimation system or due to the incorrect subjective assessment of the severity associated with these events. This further allows us to use a game theoretic framework for casting the optimization of the operator's response into the choice of the optimal strategy which minimizes the operating cost. We use a simple strategy space which is the degree of tolerance to line overloads and which is an automatic control (optimization) parameter that can be adjusted to trade off automatic load shed without propagating cascades versus reduced load shed and an increased risk of propagating cascades. The tolerance parameter is chosen to describes a smooth transition from a risk averse to a risk taken strategy. We present numerical results comparing the responses of two power grid systems to optimization approaches with different factors of risk and select the best blackout controlling parameter","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Model for Power Grid Dynamics","publicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2007.500","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076361/4076362/04076598.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2007.500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4076598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Model for Power Grid Dynamics","conferenceDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4076598/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9364616","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Model for Power Grid Dynamics","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"27550113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064409S","chronDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4076361","isNumber":"4076362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076361","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4076362","articleId":"4076598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4076601,"authors":[{"name":"Michael LeMay","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"LeMay","id":"37663247500"},{"name":"George Gross","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Gross","id":"37268076300"},{"name":"Carl A.

Most of these existing approaches are metamodel-based with metamodels representing both an abstract syntax of the corresponding modeling language and also a data structure for storing models. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because metamodels do not necessarily define all language concepts explicitly which are available for notation purposes. Therefore, we propose a by-example approach for defining inter-model mappings representing semantic correspondences between concrete domain models, which is more user-friendly, then directly specifying model transformation rules or mappings based on the abstract syntax. The inter-model mappings between domain models can be used to generate model transformation rules, by-example, taking into account the already defined mapping between abstract and concrete syntax elements. With this approach the user's knowledge about the notation of the modeling language is sufficient for the definition of model transformations regarding semantic correspondences. Hence, no detailed knowledge about the metamodel and the model transformation language is required","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4076362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2007.572","publicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4076361/4076362/04076959.pdf","startPage":"285b","endPage":"285b","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2007.572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Model Transformation Generation By-Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Towards Model Transformation Generation By-Example","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4076959/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9364829","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4076959/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Model Transformation Generation By-Example","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"27550285b.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063274S","chronDate":"3-6 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4076361","isNumber":"4076362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4076361","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4076362","articleId":"4076959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4077005,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Bouda","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Bouda","id":"38131925700"},{"name":"Josef Sprojcar","affiliation":["ARC Seibersdorf research GmbH, Wien, Austria"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Sprojcar","id":"38131926200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"0-7695-2759-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4077005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"We propose first protocol for anonymous distribution of quantum information that can be used to implement either channel with anonymous sender or channel with anonymous receiver.

They represent the backbone of transformational processes aimed at code generation. On the other end, modeling is a traditional activity in the field of non-functional validation of software/hardware systems, although non-functional models found on different notations (such as Petri Nets) and embed additional information (such as the operational profile) with respect to software models. In this paper we widen the scope of model-driven architecture by introducing a Non-Functional-MDA framework that, beside the typical model transformations for code generation, embeds new types of model transformations that allow to generate non-functional models. For an uniform integration of these practices, we define Platform Independent/Specific Models in the non-functional domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software performance","Context modeling","Computer architecture","Programming","Embedded software","Software systems","Hardware","Automation","Spine","Petri nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","program compilers","program verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven architecture","code generation","nonfunctional modeling","nonfunctional validation","functional abstraction","transformational process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WICSA.2007.30","publicationTitle":"2007 Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture (WICSA'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture (WICSA'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4077010/4077011/04077042.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICSA.2007.30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Functional Modeling and Validation in Model-Driven Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-Functional Modeling and Validation in Model-Driven Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077042/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4077042/","accessionNumber":"10222652","conferenceDate":"6-9 Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jan. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Functional Modeling and Validation in Model-Driven Architecture","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"27440025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088146S","chronDate":"6-9 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4077010","isNumber":"4077011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4077010","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4077011","articleId":"4077042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4077081,"authors":[{"name":"Hyundai Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyundai","lastName":"Park","id":"37277121900"},{"name":"Alexander W.

In this paper, we examine mixed complementarity programming models of equilibrium that can bridge the speed of response gap between suppliers and consumers yet adhere to the principle of marginal cost pricing of electricity. We develop a computable equilibrium model to estimate ex ante time-of-use (TOU) prices for a retail electricity market. It is intended that the proposed models would be useful 1) for jurisdictions (e.g., Ontario) where consumers' prices are regulated, but suppliers offer into a competitive market, 2) for forecasting forward prices in unregulated markets, and 3) in evaluation and welfare analysis of the policies regarding regulated TOU pricing compared to regulated single pricing","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4077088/04077096.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.888956","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.888956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077096","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Electricity supply industry","Costs","Energy consumption","Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Regulators","Load management","Bridges","Forward contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power markets","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consumer pricing schemes","competitive electricity markets","mixed complementarity programming models","marginal cost pricing","equilibrium model","time-of-use price estimation","price forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity markets","equilibrium modeling","mixed complementarity problem","regulated pricing","time-of-use (TOU) pricing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Model for Efficient Consumer Pricing Schemes in Electricity Markets","accessionNumber":"9293317","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4077096/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model for Efficient Consumer Pricing Schemes in Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs01-celebi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084194S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4077088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4077088","articleId":"4077096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4077107,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Geidl","affiliation":["Power Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4077088/4077107/4077107-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Geidl (S'03) was born in Wels, Austria.

The RBF network is composed of three-layer structures, which contain the input, hidden, and output layer. To simplify the network, the OLS algorithm is used first to determine the number of centers in the hidden layer. With an appropriate network structure, the EPSO algorithm is then used to tune the parameters in the network, including the dilation and translation of RBF centers and the weights between the hidden and output layer. The proposed approach has been tested on the IEEE 30-bus six-generator and practical Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) systems. Testing results indicate that the proposed approach can make a quick response and yield accurate RTPD solutions as soon as the inputs are given.

While keeping large amounts of generation in reserve protects the power system against the generation deficits that might arise from different contingencies, and thus reduces the probability of having to resort to load shedding, this reserve provision is costly. Traditional unit commitment (UC) formulations use deterministic criteria, such as the capacity of the largest online generator to set the SR requirements.

That is, the particle is made to remember its worst position also. This modification helps to explore the search space very effectively. In order to well exploit the promising solution region, a simple local random search (LRS) procedure is integrated with NPSO. The resultant NPSO-LRS algorithm is very effective in solving the nonconvex economic dispatch problems.

This issue is formulated as a nonlinear equality and inequality constrained optimization problem with an objective function incorporating both the real power loss and VSL. A new evolutionary algorithm known as bacteria foraging is applied for solving the multiobjective multivariable problem, with the UPFC location, its series injected voltage, and the transformer tap positions as the variables.

A DFIG system model in the positive and negative synchronous reference frames is presented. Variations of stator active and reactive powers and generator torque are fully defined in the presence of negative sequence voltage and current. Alternative DFIG control targets during network unbalance, such as reducing stator current unbalance, torque, and power pulsations minimization, are identified. A rotor current control strategy based on positive and negative (dq) reference frames is used to provide precise control of the rotor positive and negative sequence currents. Simulation results using EMTDC/PSCAD are presented for a 2-MW DFIG wind generation system. It shows that conventional vector control of DFIG without considering network unbalance results in excessive oscillations on the stator active/reactive power, electromagnetic torque, and stator/rotor currents even with a small stator voltage unbalance. In contrast, with the proposed control strategy, enhanced system control and operation such as minimizing oscillations in either active power, or electromagnetic torque, or stator or rotor currents can be achieved","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Modeling and Control of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines Under Unbalanced Network Conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.889113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4077088/04077149.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.889113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Modeling and Control of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines Under Unbalanced Network Conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4077149/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9293345","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Modeling and Control of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines Under Unbalanced Network Conditions","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs01-xu3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056915S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4077088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"445","xplore-issue":"4077088","articleId":"4077149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4077150,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Market Monitoring, California Independent System Operator Corporation, Folsom, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dan Yang (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1999 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002.

This work presents the first successful approach to replacing an external crystal (XTAL), the crystal oscillator (XO) and the phase-locked loop for clock generation in an IC supporting USB 2.0 using a standard CMOS fabrication process. It is shown that the primary design challenges with the implemented approach involve maintaining high frequency accuracy and low jitter. Techniques for addressing both are shown. In particular, the presented architecture exploits the effects of frequency division and low far-from-carrier phase noise to achieve low jitter. From a 1.536 GHz temperature-compensated LC reference oscillator, coherent clock signals are derived at 96MHz for the SoC logic and 12 MHz for an on-chip full-speed USB PHY. Though self-referenced, approximately plusmn400ppm total frequency accuracy is achieved over process variations, plusmn10% variation in the USB power supply voltage and temperature variation from -10 to +85degC.

The offset voltage varies by a maximum of 130 muV over a temperature range of 170degC, thereby making this a viable approach to offset cancellation","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.889365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4077153/04077175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.889365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077153","startPage":"280","endPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Precision CMOS Amplifier Using Floating-Gate Transistors for Offset Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Precision CMOS Amplifier Using Floating-Gate Transistors for Offset Cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292068","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4077175/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Precision CMOS Amplifier Using Floating-Gate Transistors for Offset Cancellation","sourcePdf":"42jssc02-srinivasan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071384S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4077153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4077153","articleId":"4077175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4077176,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Giuseppe Maria Strollo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4077153/4077176/4077176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonio Giuseppe Maria Strollo (M'05\u2013SM'06) was born in 1963.

This technique is effective at zero and low motor speed, where back electromotive force is null or extremely low. Then, the accuracy of the rotor-position detection depends strictly on the rotor saliency, that is, on the geometry of the IPM rotor. This paper aims to determine some IPM rotor-design criteria so as to improve the sensorless rotor-position detection. Since the design has to be effective in different operating conditions, both saturation and cross-coupling effects have to be taken into account. It is found that the effectiveness of the sensorless rotor-position detection can be improved by means of a proper design of the IPM motor geometry even under heavy operating conditions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4077182/04077184.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2006.887317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2006.887317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Rotor Geometry of an IPM Motor on Sensorless Control Feasibility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Geometry","Sensorless control","Voltage","Synchronous motors","Stators","Industry Applications Society","Induction motors","Frequency estimation","Force sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","permanent magnet motors","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotor geometry","IPM motor","sensorless control techniques","high-frequency stator voltage superimposition","rotor position detection","electromotive force","rotor saliency","rotor design criteria","cross-coupling effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-frequency signal injection","interior permanent-magnet (IPM) motor","low-speed sensorless control","motor design optimization","zero-speed sensorless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Rotor Geometry of an IPM Motor on Sensorless Control Feasibility","volume":"43","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4077184/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292403","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Rotor Geometry of an IPM Motor on Sensorless Control Feasibility","sourcePdf":"43tia01-bianchi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091507S","chronDate":"Jan.-feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"4077182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4077182","articleId":"4077184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4077193,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Computer and Systems Engineering, University of Oviedo, Gijon, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/4077182/4077193/4077193-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Garc\u00eda (S'02) was born in Spain in 1975.

It assumes a particular significance in the rise of technology companies in emerging economies, which have to make appropriate investment decisions. Technology managers already have a wide range of methods and tools at their disposal, but these are mostly focused on quantitative measures such as discounted cash flow and real options techniques. However, in the early stages of technology development there seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction with these techniques as there appears to be a lack of accuracy with respect to the underlying assumptions that these models require. In order to complement these models this paper will discuss an alternative approach that we call value road-mapping. By adapting roadmapping techniques the potential value streams of early stages technologies can be plotted and hence a clearer consensus based picture of the future potential of new technologies emerges. Roadmapping is a workshop-based process bringing together multifunctional perspectives, and supporting communication in particular between technical and commercial groups. The study is work in progress and is based on a growing number of cases","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Technology Management for the Global Future - PICMET 2006 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4077348/4077479/04077535.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1495","publicationTitle":"2006 Technology Management for the Global Future - PICMET 2006 Conference","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2006.296713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2006.296713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077479","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Value Roadmapping: A Structured Approach for Early Stage Technology Investment Decisions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Investments","Technology management","Cost accounting","Appropriate technology","Uncertainty","Manufacturing","Waste management","Fluid flow measurement","Business","Appraisal"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["investment","organisational aspects","technological forecasting","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["value roadmapping","technology investment","technology management","technology companies","emerging economies","technology managers","discounted cash flow","real options techniques","workshop-based process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Value Roadmapping: A Structured Approach for Early Stage Technology Investment Decisions","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4077535/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9376612","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"8-13 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Value Roadmapping: A Structured Approach for Early Stage Technology Investment Decisions","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PICMET-3-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060005S","chronDate":"July  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4077348","isNumber":"4077479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4077348","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4077479","articleId":"4077535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4077536,"authors":[{"name":"Sungjoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungjoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"38130412400"},{"name":"Seongryong Kang","affiliation":["Research Center for Technology Policy, Korea Industrial Technology Foundation, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seongryong","lastName":"Kang","id":"38126081700"},{"name":"Maengho Oh","affiliation":["Ministry of Commerce, Industry & Energy, Capital Goods Industries Bureau, South Korea"],"firstName":"Maengho","lastName":"Oh","id":"38136190000"},{"name":"Kapsoo Kim","affiliation":["Research Center for Technology Policy, Korea Industrial Technology Foundation, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kapsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38129493300"},{"name":"Euisuk Park","affiliation":["Research Center for Technology Policy, Korea Industrial Technology Foundation, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Euisuk","lastName":"Park","id":"38120929000"},{"name":"Seonghoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seonghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37067475800"},{"name":"Yongtae Park","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongtae","lastName":"Park","id":"37423940400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-890843-14-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"4077536","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"abstract":"In recent days as rapid changes in markets and technologies are increasingly to shorten the lifetime of products. It is becoming essential for firms to constantly develop the new products into markets. Technology roadmaps, therefore, are considered to be efficient, effective tool of connecting both product and technology planning's collectively, thus being widely accepted by firms. However, those roadmaps and their methodologies hitherto proposed generally tend to have overstated the qualitative, expert-dependent knowledge rather than incorporating objective information. In addition, useful methodologies are often observed to lack, to facilitate a large variety of decision-makings faced in roadmapping processes. Consequently, this paper proposes a new approach: keyword-based technology roadmapping method by using the patents which contains relatively objective information, a quantitative method to support the reliable decision-making processes. Hence, text-mining technique is utilized in this study to extract the relevant information on which the portfolio analysis, co-word analysis and network analysis are carried out, resulting in three different types of product-technology maps. Also, these maps demonstrate the applicability as to where to be applied usefully in a specific step of roadmapping processes.

This paper provides a scheme for the newly emerging \"service science\" expected to support services innovations and derives practical methodology to integrate new services to the strategic technology roadmap and roadmappinng by introducing a new independent layer of services between the market and products layers. Here, the concept of \"service\" is widely defined as \"a supporting activity to help an individual or organization to achieve its objective\". Accordingly, it includes physical supporting functions, psychological supporting functions, intellectual supporting functions, spiritual supporting functions, as well as technological supporting functions provided through products. Valuating products and systems with their added services improves customer satisfaction and the total customer value should be considered as the summation of the products/system value, added services value, and individually user added value. As for a new methodology for managing the service integrated technology/products innovation, this paper proposes a service-integrated technology roadmap/roadmapping, which involves a new concept of functions, \"requiring functions\" and \"supplying functions\" to fill the gaps between the market and service layers, as well as the service and products layers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 July 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","accessionNumber":"9376642","htmlLink":"/document/4077592/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"July 2006","conferenceDate":"8-13 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"\"Services Science\" and Services Layer Added Strategic Technology Roadmapping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\"Services Science\" and Services Layer Added Strategic Technology Roadmapping","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"PICMET-4-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054532S","chronDate":"8-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4077348","isNumber":"4077542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4077348","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4077542","articleId":"4077592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4077720,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Li","id":"37556445900"},{"name":"Weiling Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Weiling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280426600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0409-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4077720","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Interference","Downlink","Call admission control","Resource management","Communication system traffic control","System performance","Wireless communication","Frequency","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Monte Carlo methods","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDD-CDMA system","unbalanced slot allocation","uplink slot","downlink slot","cross-slot interference","Monte Carlo method","novel admission control algorithm","transmission power threshold"]}],"abstract":"The TDD-CDMA system with unbalanced slot allocation between uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) is useful for the traffic asymmetry, but the unbalanced slot will lead to cross-slot interference.

The novel admission control deal with each user in different slots: for user with high transmission power, the algorithm will first allocate the non cross-slot to it; while for user with low transmission power, the algorithm will allocate cross-slot to it. With Monte Carlo method, we simulate the novel admission control algorithm.

With this method, speckle is removed by nonlinear diffusion filtering of bandpass ultrasound images in Laplacian pyramid domain. For nonlinear diffusion in each pyramid layer, a gradient threshold is automatically determined by a variation of median absolute deviation (MAD) estimator. The performance of the proposed LPND method has been compared with that of other speckle reduction methods, including the recently proposed speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) and nonlinear coherent diffusion (NCD). In simulation and phantom studies, an average gain of 1.55 dB and 1.34 dB in contrast-to-noise ratio was obtained compared to SRAD and NCD, respectively. The visual comparison of despeckled in vivo ultrasound images from liver and carotid artery shows that the proposed LPND method could effectively preserve edges and detailed structures while thoroughly suppressing speckle. These preliminary results indicate that the proposed speckle reduction method could improve image quality and the visibility of small structures and fine details in medical ultrasound imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.889735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4077851/04077869.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.889735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Diffusion in Laplacian Pyramid Domain for Ultrasonic Speckle Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077869/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Diffusion in Laplacian Pyramid Domain for Ultrasonic Speckle Reduction","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9311576","pubMedId":"17304734","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4077869/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Diffusion in Laplacian Pyramid Domain for Ultrasonic Speckle Reduction","sourcePdf":"26tmi02-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099558S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4077851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4077851","articleId":"4077869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4077890,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelaziz Zouidi","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences et Techniques de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Abdelaziz","lastName":"Zouidi","id":"37294420200"},{"name":"Farhat Fnaiech","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences et Techniques de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Farhat","lastName":"Fnaiech","id":"37270216400"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["Ecole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Canada Research Chair in Electric Energy Conversion and Power Electronics, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0497-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0496-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4077890","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077890","abstract":"Three-phase shunt active power filters (shunt APFs) are widely used in industrial applications to compensate for harmonics, generated by nonlinear loads.

Parameters of antecedent membership functions and consequent parameter vectors are encoded into a chromosome so that antecedent/consequent parameters and rule structure of a fuzzy logic controller are optimized simultaneously during evolution. Three optimization criteria are proposed to find a set of good fuzzy logic controllers using Pareto optimality. The proposed algorithm is applied to the well-known car parking problem and produced a Pareto set of fuzzy logic controllers that can control the motion of a vehicle for automated parking. Each fuzzy logic controller in the set has unique characteristics and can be selected according to users' preferences, which is one of the major advantages of using the multi-objective evolutionary optimization","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295615","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4077881/04077946.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"334","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Fuzzy Controller for Car Parking Problem Using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4077946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of Fuzzy Controller for Car Parking Problem Using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9144374","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4077946/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Fuzzy Controller for Car Parking Problem Using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization Approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-1-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076294S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4077881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4077881","articleId":"4077946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4077990,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Molino-Minero-Re","affiliation":["SARTI, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Molino-Minero-Re","id":"38273584000"},{"name":"Mariano Lopez-Garcia","affiliation":["SARTI, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain"],"firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Lopez-Garcia","id":"38270011500"},{"name":"Antoni Manuel-Lazaro","affiliation":["SARTI, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain"],"firstName":"Antoni","lastName":"Manuel-Lazaro","id":"38270157800"},{"name":"Joaquin del-Rio-Fernandez","affiliation":["SARTI, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"del-Rio-Fernandez","id":"37075273600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0497-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0496-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4077990","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4077990","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Adaptive filters","Signal processing","Inverse problems","Structural beams","Data acquisition","Information analysis","Signal analysis","Materials testing","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","deconvolution","filtering theory","neural nets","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution method","impulsive signal deconvolution","neural-networks","adaptive filter","inverse impulse response","media propagation","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","cantilever beam"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295521","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4077881/04077990.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"571","endPage":"574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4077881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deconvolution Method for Impulsive Signals using Neural-Networks","abstract":"This work describes a proposal method for impulsive signal deconvolution.

In this paper, a hidden Markov model (HMM) approach is introduced into boiler flame image classification. Firstly, we define a feature vector for each flame image including 5 feature elements, which are the brightness of flame, the area of the high temperature flame, the brightness of high temperature flame, the rate of area of the high temperature flame, the offset of the flame centroid respectively. Next, for classification and recognition of the flame image, a method of the maximum posterior marginal (MPM) based on the hidden Markov random field model, which is described as a probabilistic framework for learning probability distribution defined on the sample space, is introduced. Then, we construct a sample space including 63 flame images, parts of which are used to train the model. Finally, the entire samples are recognized and classified.

This paper presents a protection strategy based on the integration of pulse-by-pulse current limiting technique into solid-state protection switches. The gate signal of solid-state switches is controlled using pulse-by-pulse current limiting technique to restrict the fault current level within a preset range, hence relieves the fault current withstanding and interruption requirements of solid state switches. Distribution circuit architecture is proposed to use with the protection switches, so that the loads in non-faulted parts of the system can ride through the fault current limiting process unperturbed. Commercially available solid-state switches become usable for high power density applications with the proposed protection strategy. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy for various fault locations to show the strategy can be used in entire DC distribution systems. Interactions between the protection switches and upstream converters with current limiting control are discussed. Also the inductance required to slow down the fault current rising speed is discussed","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current limiting technique based protection strategy for an industrial DC distribution system","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295740","startPage":"820","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078165","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078165/04078190.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Current limiting technique based protection strategy for an industrial DC distribution system","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4078190/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9210277","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current limiting technique based protection strategy for an industrial DC distribution system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-2-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034877S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4078165","articleId":"4078190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4078192,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-hsiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechsnical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-hsiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"38128351100"},{"name":"Kuo-ming Chang","affiliation":["Department of Mechsnical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-ming","lastName":"Chang","id":"37405633700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0497-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0496-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4078192","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078192","abstract":"Piezoelectric (PZT) actuators are popularly applied as actuators in micro-positioning systems due to its characteristic of infinitely small displacement resolution.

It's proved that the emitter inductance slows down the turn-on and turn-off procedure thus increases the turn-on and turn-off switching power losses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4078195/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"10185724","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parasitic Inductance Effects on the Switching Loss Measurement of Power Semiconductor Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitic Inductance Effects on the Switching Loss Measurement of Power Semiconductor Devices","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-2-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070571S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4078165","articleId":"4078195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4078207,"authors":[{"name":"T.

power generation capability, has been implemented using a 27-level inverter. Each phase of this inverter is composed of three \"H\" converters, all of them connected to the same dc link and their outputs connected through output transformers scaled in power of three. The filter can compensate load currents with high harmonic content and low power factor, resulting in sinusoidal currents from the source. The dc link is connected to a battery pack, which can be charged from two sources: the ac mains supply and a photovoltaic array connected to the batteries through a MPT (maximum power tracker) converter. These characteristics make it possible to produce active power and to feed the contaminating load during prolonged voltage outages.

In order to work with a simplified but still accurate model, a representation in a rotating reference frame dq0 in combination with an average model are normally used. The result is a model that operates with ripple free inputs, outputs, and state variables that should be the accurate average value of the actual variables. However, the average model of these topologies could lead to errors if damping resistors are used. A case study shows as much as 10% error in the DC link current between the actual value and the predicted by the average model. This paper finds and shows systematically the source of the error and proposes a method for the accurate average modeling of CSRs with damping resistors.

The soft-switching technique is based on zero-current-switching (ZCS) cells, providing ZC (zero-current) turn-on and ZCZV (zero-current-zero-voltage) turn-off for the active switches, and ZV (zero-voltage) turn-on and ZC (zero-current) turn-off for the boost diodes. The disadvantages related to reverse recovery effects of boost diodes operated in continuous conduction mode (additional losses, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems) are minimized, due to the operation in critical conduction mode. In addition, due to the interleaving technique, the rectifier's features include the reduction in the input current ripple, the reduction in the output voltage ripple, the use of low stress devices, low volume for the EMI input filter, high input power factor (PF), and low total harmonic distortion (THD) in the input current, in compliance with the IEC61000-3-2 standards. The digital controller has been developed using a hardware description language (VHDL) and implemented using a XC2S200E-SpartanII-E/Xilinx FPGA device, performing a true critical conduction operation mode for all interleaved cells, and a closed-loop to provide the output voltage regulation, like as a pre-regulator rectifier.

Multi-layer windings (including litz wire) can typically achieve lower loss, but several situations that may favor single-layer windings are discussed. As shown in previous work, for sinusoidal waveforms, if the minimum practical layer thickness is 1.5 skin depths or greater, single-layer windings are preferred. If the maximum number of practical layers is limited, increasing the number of layers decreases the loss approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the number of layers. For waveforms with strong harmonic content, it becomes more difficult to reduce losses with multi-layer windings. We study typical waveforms for power converter circuits and conclude that, for waveforms used in power electronics, multi-layer windings have significant advantages even with only a few layers. The number of layers needed can be as few as two layers for many waveforms; other waveforms, such as square waveforms with fast rise times, typically require four to six layers to effect a significant improvement over a single-layer design","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295688","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1473","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078165/04078303.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Single-Layer and Multi-Layer Windings with Physical Constraints or Strong Harmonics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Skin","Wire","Nonhomogeneous media","Power system harmonics","Educational institutions","USA Councils","Inductors","Circuits","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics","inductors","power convertors","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer windings","single-layer windings","transformer windings","inductor windings","sinusoidal waveforms","power converter circuits","power electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Single-Layer and Multi-Layer Windings with Physical Constraints or Strong Harmonics","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4078303/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9132198","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Single-Layer and Multi-Layer Windings with Physical Constraints or Strong Harmonics","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-2-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053407S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4078165","articleId":"4078303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4078312,"authors":[{"name":"Esam Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Esam","lastName":"Khan","id":"38271115000"},{"name":"M.

Experimental results carried on a prototyping platform are given to illustrate the efficiency of the developed synchronous machine speed controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Speed Control of Synchronous Machine using a P-PI Controller","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295698","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078165/04078313.pdf","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Speed Control of Synchronous Machine using a P-PI Controller","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4078313/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"10185758","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Speed Control of Synchronous Machine using a P-PI Controller","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-2-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056237S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4078165","articleId":"4078313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4078317,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Le-Huy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval Quebec, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Le-Huy","id":"38303198400"},{"name":"Sylvain Guerette","affiliation":["Laboratoire Simulation de r\u00e9seaux, Varennes, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Guerette","id":"38303353500"},{"name":"Louis A.

This paper discusses the possibilities of the distributed power generation systems (DPGS) to deliver power when grid disturbances are present in the utility network. The focus is set more on the control strategies for active power generation, and mainly on the creation of the reference currents which fulfill the demanded output power.

Based on Adaline networks, the proposed method is called the diphase currents method. The architecture and the learning are formulated based on an original decomposition of the disturbed currents. These currents are converted in the alphabeta- or DQ-spaces to separate each harmonic component in a linear expression. In this harmonic compensation method, the harmonic components may be individually selected and the reactive power may be compensated. The proposed method is robust and has been efficiently compared to other conventional and neural harmonic compensation methods. In order to validate the performance of the diphase currents method, simulation studies are carried out in the presence of plant variations. Experiments are also presented to show the performance of the proposed neural method under many practical industrial conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295832","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078480/04078507.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1737","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power harmonic identification and compensation with an artificial neural network method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Power harmonic identification and compensation with an artificial neural network method","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","accessionNumber":"10185734","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4078507/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power harmonic identification and compensation with an artificial neural network method","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-3-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05464S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4078480","articleId":"4078507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4078512,"authors":[{"name":"Salem Rahmani","affiliation":["Research group in Signal, Image and Intelligent Control of the Industrial Systems, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37294419300"},{"name":"Kamal Al-Haddad","affiliation":["Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion and Power Electronics, Ecolede Technologie Superieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Al-Haddad","id":"37274676300"},{"name":"Farhat Fnaiech","affiliation":["Research group in Signal, Image and Intelligent Control of the Industrial Systems, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Farhat","lastName":"Fnaiech","id":"37270216400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0497-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0496-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4078512","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1064},"abstract":"In recent years, harmonic resonance or harmonic propagation between line inductances and shunt capacitors installed for power factor correction, and so on has multiplied voltage and current harmonics in industrial power plants and utility power distribution systems. This paper presents a shunt active power filter to attenuate harmonic propagation resulting from series/parallel resonance between capacitors for power factor correction and line inductors in a power distribution line. The active power filter based on voltage detection is controlled in such a way as to present infinite impedance to the external circuit for the fundamental frequency, and as to exhibit low resistance for harmonic frequencies. When the active filter is installed on the end bus of the feeder, it successfully performs harmonic damping throughout the distribution line. Simulation results clarify that installation of the active filter acting as a harmonic terminator on the end bus of the feeder can damp out harmonic propagation throughout the feeder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Damping","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Power distribution","Shunt (electrical)","Resonance","Power capacitors","Power factor correction","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","distribution networks","power capacitors","power filters","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase shunt active power filter","harmonic propagation","power distribution systems","harmonic resonance","shunt capacitors","power factor correction","industrial power plants","harmonic damping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage detection","power distribution systems","shunt active power filter","harmonic damping","harmonic propagation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295837","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078480/04078512.pdf","startPage":"1760","endPage":"1764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Phase Shunt Active Power Filter for Damping of Harmonic Propagation in Power Distribution Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Phase Shunt Active Power Filter for Damping of Harmonic Propagation in Power Distribution Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078512/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4078512/","accessionNumber":"10185740","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Phase Shunt Active Power Filter for Damping of Harmonic Propagation in Power Distribution Systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-3-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042726S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4078480","articleId":"4078512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4078545,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37964183200"},{"name":"Barbara J.

The planning and modeling of an energy generation system is one of the important issues when developing a region. Given the competitive market for energy sources and complex energy production schedules, it is useful to determine the important factors affecting the optimal utilization of the energy source. Since several models for optimizing alternative energy sources generally exist, it is important to develop approaches for evaluating the different models for planning and operating effective energy systems. We develop a methodology for analyzing such alternative models and demonstrate this approach for the case of evaluating wind energy farm. Three different modeling approaches for planning and operating a wind energy system are discussed in terms of their ability to optimize storage scheduling, timing cycle and time step scaling, and selling points scheduling. These modeling approaches represent three different approaches for maximizing the performance of energy utilization. Our methodology not only evaluates the difference between these three approaches but also estimates the relationships between them. Moreover, we investigate models of farm energy storage for wind energy sources in detail and extend them for the analysis of uncertainty associated with engineering and non-engineering decisions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Wind energy","Power engineering and energy","Energy resources","Power system modeling","Pollution","Power system reliability","Material storage","Mechanical engineering","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","power generation planning","power generation scheduling","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternative energy systems","traditional energy resources","alternative green energy resources","energy generation system","complex energy production schedules","wind energy farm","storage scheduling","timing cycle","time step scaling","selling points scheduling","energy utilization","farm energy storage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2006.295870","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035454/4078480/04078545.pdf","startPage":"1943","endPage":"1948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4078480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2006.295870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Modeling Approaches for Optimizing Alternative Energy Systems: An Example of Farm Storage for Wind Energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4078545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Modeling Approaches for Optimizing Alternative Energy Systems: An Example of Farm Storage for Wind Energy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4078545/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4078545/","accessionNumber":"9175937","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Modeling Approaches for Optimizing Alternative Energy Systems: An Example of Farm Storage for Wind Energy","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISIE-3-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04428S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035454","isNumber":"4078480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035454","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4078480","articleId":"4078545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4078558,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Considering dynamic voltage security, the presented model attempts to provide sufficient voltage stability margin for post contingency condition. This is done by means of interruption some portion of loads at minimum cost. The voltage stability margin, which is measured as a MW distance to the collapse point, is incorporated into the power flow equations. Although some powerful mathematical based nonlinear optimization techniques are available to find the optimal solution of the problem, here the intention is to show the feasibility and efficiency of the PSO algorithm when it is applied to such problems.

Real-time simulation of PMSM drives enables rapid deployment and thorough testing of efficient control strategies for vehicular or industrial applications. The PMSM model is based on Park transform with a reference frame on the rotor and assumes sinusoidal flux induction. The PMSM machine in driven by a 3-phase IGBT inverter. Both models are implemented in RT-LAB using a Simulink blockset called Xilinx System Generator (XSG), without any VHDL coding. The paper explains various aspects of the design of the motor drive models in fixed-point representation in XSG, as well as actual simulation validations against a standard PMSM drive model built in Simulink. The PMSM drive is coded along with a test PWM source, built-in the FPGA, with user selectable dead-time, modulation index, source angle offset and frequency. The overall model compilation and simulation is made entirely automatic under the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform. The drive can also run in closed loop with a controller executed on a CPU of the real-time simulator. The final PMSM drive model runs with a 20 ns integration time step, allows for time multiplexing of d-q values and has an input-output latency of 310 ns (250 ns for the PMSM machine alone).

A modified simulated annealing algorithm (MSAA) is proposed as a statistical technique for obtaining approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is a combination of simulated annealing and Hamming scan algorithms. This algorithm is used to design orthogonal polyphase sequence sets which have good correlation properties. Some of the synthesized results are presented, and their properties are better than other known in the literature. The synthesized polyphase sequence sets are promising for practical application to multiple radar systems and spread spectrum communication applications.

Minimizing risk in partner selection and ensuring the due date of the project are keys to ensure the success of the VE. In this paper, the description of a partner selection problem is introduced. The HPSO with simulated annealing (SA) is proposed to solve the complex combinatorial optimization problems. PSO employs a collaborative population-based search, which is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. It combines local search (by self experience) and global search (by neighboring experience), possessing high search efficiency. SA employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and the search process can be controlled by the cooling schedule. The hybrid algorithm combines the high speed of PSO with the powerful ability to avoid being trapped in local minimum of SA. Compared with the PSO and SA, the HPSO has better synthetic performance in both the computation speed and optimality.

To achieve the required processing capacity, cross-layer collaborative in-network processing among sensors emerges as a promising solution: sensors do not only process information at the application layer, but also synchronize their communication activities to exchange partially processed data for parallel processing. However, scheduling computation and communication events is a challenging problem in WSNs due to limited resource availability and shared communication medium. In this work, an application-independent task mapping and scheduling solution in multihop homogeneous WSNs, multihop task mapping and scheduling (MTMS), is presented that provides real-time guarantees. Using our proposed application model, the multihop channel model, and the communication scheduling algorithm, computation tasks and associated communication events are scheduled simultaneously. The dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) algorithm is presented to further optimize energy consumption.

becoming critical to detect subtle delay defects. Existing structural at-speed test methods are inadequate because they are unable to supply sufficiently-varied functional clock sequences to test complex sequential logic. Moreover, they require tight restrictions on the circuit design. In this paper, we present a new method for at-speed structural test of ASICs, having no tight restrictions on the circuit design. In the present implementation, any complex at-speed functional clock waveform for 16 cycles can be applied. We present DFT structures that can generate high-speed launch-off-capture as well as launch-off-scan clocking without the need to switch a scan enable at-speed. We also describe a method to test asynchronous clock domains simultaneously. Experimental results on fault coverage and hardware measurements for three multi-million gate ASICs demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2006.297686","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4079296/4042774/04079364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2006.297686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"At-Speed Structural Test For High-Performance ASICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4079364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079364/","displayDocTitle":"At-Speed Structural Test For High-Performance ASICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9320196","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4079364/","conferenceDate":"22-27 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"At-Speed Structural Test For High-Performance ASICs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITC-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077331S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4079296","isNumber":"4042774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4079296","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4042774","articleId":"4079364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4079366,"authors":[{"name":"Tsu-wei Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-wei","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37397370100"},{"name":"Jin-fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279861800"},{"name":"Chih-chiang Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-chiang","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276774700"},{"name":"Alex Pao","affiliation":["Intellectual Property Development, Faraday Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Pao","id":"37687902000"},{"name":"Kevin Chiu","affiliation":["Intellectual Property Development, Faraday Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37685776200"},{"name":"Eliot Chen","affiliation":["Intellectual Property Development, Faraday Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Eliot","lastName":"Chen","id":"37693619400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0291-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0292-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4079366","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":199},"abstract":"This paper presents a reconfigurable built-in self-repair (ReBISR) scheme for multiple repairable RAM cores with different sizes and redundancy organizations (i.e., spare rows/spare columns or spare rows/spare IOs).

maintain the reliability becomes an important issue in IC production, especially for high density memory circuits. Error detection and correction (EDAC) schemes have been widely used for memory circuits for this purpose, but ordinary EDAC schemes are not suitable for memories with long codewords. The demand for low-power memory is increasing due to the growth in portable electronics markets. Power reduction in memories with DRAM-like cells can be done by reducing the refresh frequency, but the loss of data integrity should be taken care of seriously. To solve the above two issues, we propose a parallel encoding and decoding EDAC scheme, which can be used on memories with long codewords. Targeting refresh power reduction, we have implemented our scheme on an industrial pseudo SRAM (PSRAM), and have completed experiments. The major hardware penalty is the parity overhead that is 1/9, and the longest delay of our circuit is 3.6ns for the PSRAM fabricated by a 0.11mum CMOS technology. With respect to the 70ns access time of the PSRAM, the proposed EDAC scheme can be integrated with the read/write operations without increasing the latency. Experimental results show that the refresh time can be extended greatly, without sacrificing reliability","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4079296/4042774/04079367.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced EDAC Methodology for Low Power PSRAM","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2006.297689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2006.297689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4079367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced EDAC Methodology for Low Power PSRAM","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9320217","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4079367/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced EDAC Methodology for Low Power PSRAM","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITC-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053834S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4079296","isNumber":"4042774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4079296","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4042774","articleId":"4079367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4079377,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Pei","id":"38256578900"},{"name":"Wen-ben Jone","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-ben","lastName":"Jone","id":"37273399800"},{"name":"Yi-ming Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yi-ming","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277446100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0291-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0292-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-3539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"}],"articleNumber":"4079377","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Modeling and Detection for Drowsy SRAM Caches","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4079296/4042774/04079377.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Test Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2006.297699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042774","doi":"10.1109/TEST.2006.297699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Electrical fault detection","Voltage","Automatic testing","Built-in self-test","Test pattern generators","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","cache storage","fault location","low-power electronics","memory architecture","SPICE","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault modeling","fault detection","drowsy SRAM caches","drowsy cache design","chip fabrication process","spot defects","normal mode","drowsy mode","different resistance regions","HSpice","fault models","march algorithm","data caches","instruction caches","built-in self-repair"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4079377","abstract":"With the introduction of the drowsy cache design technique (Kim et al., 2004), new fault behaviors appear and more restrictive design rules must be applied to the chip fabrication process. In this research, we simulate all possible spot defects (SDs) under normal mode and drowsy mode in different resistance regions using HSpice. Six new fault models appear with the introduction of drowsy mode for memory arrays. When we derive a march algorithm for the new fault models of this low-power cache, several simplification rules are utilized to reduce the test complexity. As a result, we develop a march algorithm which can detect all SDs in either data caches or instruction caches.

The MRAM is fast and does not need a high supply voltage for read/write operations. It can also endure almost unlimited read/write cycles. These combined advantages of RAM and flash memory make it a potential choice for SOC. In this paper, we present the write disturbance fault (WDF) model for MRAM, i.e., a fault that affects the data stored in the MRAM cells due to excessive magnetic field during the write operation. The proposed WDF model is justified by chip measurement results. We also construct the SPICE macro model for the magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) device of the toggle MRAM to obtain circuit simulation results. An MRAM chip has been designed and fabricated using a CMOS-based 0.18mum technology. We also present an MRAM fault simulator called RAMSES-M, based on which we derive the shortest test for the proposed WDF model. The test is shown to be better and more robust as compared with March C.

It is all the more true for dies designed to be integrated in complex systems. Thus highly efficient RF wafer testing is mandatory for those applications to prevent the loss of assembled systems due to defective RF dies. The problem is that current RF probing technologies hardly fulfil the industrial test requirements in terms of accuracy, reliability and cost. The proposed method proves to be a very interesting alternative to validate RF parameters with no need of expensive RF equipments (RF probes and RF automated test equipments (ATE)). A new test strategy based on DC or very low frequency (LF) measurements, which allows the elimination of expensive RF tests, is presented. The main idea is to insert some simple design for test (DfT) circuitry within the chip. This DfT provides relevant information on the structural behavior of the device blocks. The internal node data are additional to standard DC test measurements like power supply current or advanced DC test signatures (e.g. Vdd ramping), and LF measurements like gain in loopback mode. Since RF performance of each block is directly related to such structural data, it is possible to predict the RF characteristics of the blocks without time consuming RF measurements.

However, measuring cache performance for one or two data input sets provides little insight into how cache behavior varies across all data input sets and all cache configurations. This paper uses locality analysis to generate a parameterized model of program cache behavior. Given a cache size and associativity, this model predicts the miss rate for arbitrary data input set sizes. This model also identifies critical data input sizes where cache behavior exhibits marked changes. Experiments show this technique is within 2 percent of the hit rate for set associative caches on a set of floating-point and integer programs using array and pointer-based data structures. Building on the new model, this paper presents an interactive visualization tool that uses a three-dimensional plot to show miss rate changes across program data sizes and cache sizes and its use in evaluating compiler transformations.

Most existing DVS algorithms assume information about task periodicity or a priori knowledge about the task set to be scheduled. This paper presents an analytical model of general tasks for DVS assuming job timing information is known only after a task release. It models the voltage scaling process as a transfer function-based filtering system, which facilitates the design of two efficient scaling algorithms. The first is a time-invariant scaling policy and it is proved to be a generalization of several popular DVS algorithms for periodic, sporadic, and aperiodic tasks. A more energy efficient policy is a time-variant scaling algorithm for aperiodic tasks. It is optimal in the sense that it is online without assumed information about future task releases. The algorithm turns out to be a water-filling process with a linear time complexity. It can be applied to scheduling based on worst-case execution times as well as online slack distribution when jobs complete earlier. We further establish two relationships between computation capacity and deadline misses to provide a statistical real-time guarantee with reduced capacity","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.48","startPage":"358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4079510/04079518.pdf","endPage":"372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.48","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079518/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Modeling and Scheduling for Dynamic Voltage Scaling with Statistical Real-Time Guarantee","volume":"56","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4079518/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9435127","publicationDate":"March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Modeling and Scheduling for Dynamic Voltage Scaling with Statistical Real-Time Guarantee","sourcePdf":"t0358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108474S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4079510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4079510","articleId":"4079518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4079521,"authors":[{"name":"James Chien-mo Li","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department and GIEE, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4079510/4079521/4079521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James Chien-Mo Li (M'02) received the BSEE degree in 1993 from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The calibration features allow performance boost after manufacturing test and maintain such performance levels during normal operation, thus preserving product quality. This strategy has been proven successful commercially. In this paper, we discuss the impact on performance and product quality of both permanent and transient faults possibly affecting these calibration circuits during manufacturing and normal operation, respectively. In particular, we consider the case of an on-chip clock calibration feature of a commercial high performance microprocessor. We show that some possible permanent faults may render the on-chip clock calibration schemes useless (in process variations' compensation), while it is impossible for common manufacturing testing to detect this incorrect behavior. This means that a faulty operating microprocessor may pass the testing phase and be put onto the market, with a consequent impact on product quality and increase in defect level. Similarly, we show that some possible transient faults occurring during the microprocessor in-field operation could defeat the purpose of on-chip clock calibration, again resulting in faulty operation of the microprocessor. This has long range implications to microprocessors' design as well, considering that process variations on die, as well as across the process, would worsen with continued scaling. Proper strategies to test these clock calibration features and to guarantee their correct operation in the field cannot be ignored. Possible design approaches to solve this problem are discussed","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Circuit faults","Calibration","Delays","Microprocessors","System-on-chip","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","logic design","logic testing","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor design","on-chip clock calibration","electrical parameter variation","manufacturing process variation","product quality","permanent-transient fault","logic testing","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","testing","fault tolerance","VLSI."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4079522","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.53","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4079510/04079522.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.53","startPage":"415","endPage":"428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Won't On-Chip Clock Calibration Guarantee Performance Boost and Product Quality?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Won't On-Chip Clock Calibration Guarantee Performance Boost and Product Quality?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079522/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4079522/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9435131","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Won't On-Chip Clock Calibration Guarantee Performance Boost and Product Quality?","sourcePdf":"t0415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080345S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4079510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4079510","articleId":"4079522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4079607,"authors":[{"name":"Jos M.

The objective of the optimization was to find settings that complied with the increasingly stringent emission regulations while also maintaining, or even reducing the fuel consumption. A large database of stationary engine tests, covering a wide range of experimental conditions was used for this analysis. The ANNs were used as a simulation tool, receiving as inputs the engine operating parameters, and producing as outputs the resulting emission levels and fuel consumption. The ANN outputs were then used to evaluate the objective function of the optimization process, which was performed with a GA approach.

Surprisingly, within the context of multiobjective (MO) optimization, the impact of fitness assignment on the exploration-exploitation balance has drawn little attention. The vast majority of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) presented to date resort to Pareto dominance classification as a fitness assignment methodology. However, the proportion of Pareto optimal elements in a set P grows with the dimensionality of P. Therefore, when the number of objectives of a multiobjective problem (MOP) is large, Pareto dominance-based ranking procedures become ineffective in sorting out the quality of solutions. This paper investigates the potential of using preference order-based approach as an optimality criterion in the ranking stage of MOEAs. A ranking procedure that exploits the definition of preference ordering (PO) is proposed, along with two strategies that make different use of the conditions of efficiency provided, and it is compared with a more traditional Pareto dominance-based ranking scheme within the framework of NSGA-II. A series of extensive experiments is performed on seven widely applied test functions, namely, DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ3, DTLZ4, DTLZ5, DTLZ6, and DTLZ7, for up to eight objectives. The results are analyzed through a suite of five performance metrics and indicate that the ranking procedure based on PO enables NSGA-II to achieve better scalability properties compared with the standard ranking scheme and suggest that the proposed methodology could be successfully extended to other MOEAs","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2006.876362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4079606/04079613.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.876362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation on Preference Order Ranking Scheme for Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4079613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079613/","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation on Preference Order Ranking Scheme for Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9290212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4079613/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation on Preference Order Ranking Scheme for Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization","sourcePdf":"11tevc01-dipierro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119177S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4079606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4079606","articleId":"4079613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4079614,"authors":[{"name":"Julia Handl","affiliation":["Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4079606/4079614/4079614-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julia Handl received the B.Sc.

For several of these, recent research has suggested the use of genetic algorithms (GAs). Historically, the Pruumlfer code has been one of the most popular representations for spanning trees, due largely to the bijective mapping between genotype and phenotype. However, it is has attracted much criticism for its low locality, a primary reason for its poor performance in GAs. Other representations such as direct encoding and network random keys have been shown to be far more effective. In 2001, an alternative called the Blob code was identified and adapted for use in GAs. It was shown to exhibit significantly higher locality than the Pruumlfer code. For a simple test problem, a GA using the Blob code was found to substantially outperform one using the Pruumlfer code. This paper suggests an alternative called the Dandelion code, which is more efficient and exhibits yet higher locality. Although both direct encoding and NetKeys are shown to give better results on the test problems used in this paper, the Dandelion code should be considered as a strong alternative, particularly for very large networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9290216","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4079619/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Dandelion Code: A New Coding of Spanning Trees for Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Dandelion Code: A New Coding of Spanning Trees for Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"11tevc01-thompson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111844S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4079606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4079606","articleId":"4079619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4079623,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Fong Chao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Fong","lastName":"Chao","id":"37285285900"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092300"},{"name":"Chia-Yi Su","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Yi","lastName":"Su","id":"37560220000"},{"name":"John G.

Conventional multiple reference frames single current macroblock (MRSC) scheme only considers the data reuse within one frame, and requires on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth in proportional to the reference frame number. In this paper, a single reference frame multiple current macroblocks (SRMC) scheme is presented to further exploit the data reuse at frame level. With frame-level rescheduling of the motion estimation ME procedures in different reference frames, one loaded search window can be utilized by multiple current MBs in different original frames. The demanded on-chip memory size and off-chip memory bandwidth for MRF-ME can thus be reduced to those supporting only one reference frame. Moreover, based on SRMC scheme, an architecture prototype with two-stage mode decision flow is proposed.

First, an image is separated into illumination and reflectance components. Next, the illumination component is manipulated adaptively for image dynamics by using a new content measure. Then, the reflectance component based on the measure of the spectral contents of the image is manipulated for image contrast. The spectral content measure is computed from the energy distribution across different spectral bands in a discrete cosine transform (DCT) block. The proposed approach also introduces a simple scheme for estimating and reducing noise information directly in the DCT domain. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm enhances the details in the dark and the bright areas with low computations without boosting noise information and affecting the compressibility of the original image since it performs on the images in the compressed domain.

First, a general formal framework of shot boundary detection techniques is proposed. Three critical techniques, i.e., the representation of visual content, the construction of continuity signal and the classification of continuity values, are identified and formulated in the perspective of pattern recognition. Meanwhile, the major challenges to the framework are identified. Second, a comprehensive review of the existing approaches is conducted. The representative approaches are categorized and compared according to their roles in the formal framework. Based on the comparison of the existing approaches, optimal criteria for each module of the framework are discussed, which will provide practical guide for developing novel methods. Third, with all the above issues considered, we present a unified shot boundary detection system based on graph partition model. Extensive experiments are carried out on the platform of TRECVID. The experiments not only verify the optimal criteria discussed above, but also show that the proposed approach is among the best in the evaluation of TRECVID 2005. Finally, we conclude the paper and present some further discussions on what shot boundary detection can learn from other related fields","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2006.888023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4079649","startPage":"168","endPage":"186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4079649/04079667.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Formal Study of Shot Boundary Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4079667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4079667/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Formal Study of Shot Boundary Detection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9329579","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Formal Study of Shot Boundary Detection","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt02-yuan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164927S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4079649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"4079649","articleId":"4079667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":4079998,"authors":[{"name":"Mahendra C.
