All other stations receive the transmitted message and examine its address field (a code for the particular station to which the message is being sent). If a station decodes its own address, it takes the appropriate action; otherwise it ignores the message. MAP development programs have evolved to the point of making products available for network implementation, and users should begin planning for MAP or inquiring about MAP products from computer and communications suppliers.

Such systems may have a variety of forms, a common example of which is shown in Figure 1. In the case illustrated, the sampling is performed on the control error by a so-called sampler which is indicated as a mechanical switch which closes momentarily every T seconds. The data at the output of such a switch consist of a train of equally spaced pulses of short duration whose envelope is the control error function. In some practical systems, the separation between successive pulses is controlled by some characteristic of the input signal and consequently is not constant.

However, the computations required are exceedingly tedious, even for the simplest type of system. Alternatively, a locus plotted in the frequency domain has been proposed by Linvill,1 to permit studies to be made of closed-loop stability (in accordance with Nyquist's criterion). Here again the computations are tedious. It is further pointed out that the Nyquist plot obtained in this manner applies only at the sampling instants and, as such, the well-known techniques pertaining to relative stability of continuous systems do not readily apply, although absolute stability is well defined by this technique. Consequently, in most practical situations, the designer has found it expedient to resort to analogue computer studies to determine how the transient response depends upon such factors as the sampling frequency or the velocity constant of the proposed system. The purpose of this paper is to furnish a set of dimensionless curves, based upon computer studies, which are of a sufficiently generalized nature to permit approximate design criteria to be established for a wide variety of system transfer functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6371373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1954","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"July 1954","volume":"73","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transient analysis of sampled-data control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient analysis of sampled-data control systems","sourcePdf":"148153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019815S","chronDate":"July  1954","isNumber":"6371363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6366379","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6371373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6371424,"authors":[{"name":"R.

There is good reason to believe that current flow in the equipment-grounding system in a-c power systems will not stray far from the power cable over which the outgoing current flows. It follows that the installation of conductive material in an equipment ground system unless properly located can be ineffective and wasteful, and can create a false sense of security.

The values of measurements may be designated by integers corresponding to their nearest numbers of units. Round-off errors have values between \u00b11/2 unit, and can be made small by choice of the basic unit. It is apparent, however, that the smaller the size of the unit, the larger will be the numbers required to represent the same physical quantities and the greater will be the difficulty and expense in storing and processing these numbers. Often, a balance has to be struck between accuracy and economy. In order to establish such a balance, it is necessary to have a means of evaluating quantitatively the distortion resulting from rough quantization. The analytical difficulty arises from the inherent nonlinearities of the quantization process.","doi":"10.1109/TAI.1961.6371702","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part II: Applications and Industry","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part II: Applications and Industry","pdfPath":"/iel5/6366379/6371684/06371702.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1961.6371702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6371684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of amplitude-quantized sampled-data systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6371702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6371702/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of amplitude-quantized sampled-data systems","volume":"79","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of amplitude-quantized sampled-data systems","sourcePdf":"555568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035083S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"6371684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6366379","citationCount":"84","articleId":"6371702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6371866,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This circuit with modifications has been analyzed by many authors, a few of whom are mentioned in references 1 to 9. In almost all the analyses simplifying assumptions have been made concerning the magnitude of some of the circuit parameters, very little work having been done on circuits in which La and Ld are not zero. It is the object of this paper to analyze and discuss the changes in current wave shapes produced by variation of the circuit parameters Ra, Rd, La, and Ld. In order to understand these changes the circuit is analyzed mathematically. The magnetization constraint of the cores is approximated by three linear segments as shown in Figure 2. The procedure, following a method first used by A. Boyajian,10 is to obtain solutions for the circuit currents and core fluxes which apply only when the cores are operating on specified linear segments of their respective magnetization curves. When the cores are operating on such a pair of segments the equations of the system become linear, and consequently are solved easily. It is necessary then only to match final and initial conditions at the time of transition from one segment to the next. Equations are thus derived which permit calculation of the instantaneous values of the circuit currents and core fluxes in transient and steady-state conditions. The equations are verified by quantitatively comparing calculated instantaneous values of the current wave shapes with the instantaneous values obtained experimentally. They then are used to explain the changes of wave shape which occur when any of the circuit parameters are changed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic cores","Equations","Magnetization","Magnetic circuits","Mathematical model","Steady-state","Voltage control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCE.1952.6371894","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6371876/06371894.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6371876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1952.6371894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Series-connected magnetic amplifier with inductive loading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6371894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Series-connected magnetic amplifier with inductive loading","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6371894/","volume":"71","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1952","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1952","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1952","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series-connected magnetic amplifier with inductive loading","sourcePdf":"101110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017442S","chronDate":"Jan.  1952","isNumber":"6371876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6371894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1952","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6371911,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The nonuniform field, although difficult to analyze, is of considerable importance from the engineering viewpoint as it is the condition most generally encountered in electrical apparatus. At atmospheric pressure, sulfur hexafluoride has unexpectedly high 60-cycle breakdown voltage for large gaps. In this case, the presence of corona precedes sparkover. This was termed \u201ccorona-stabilized breakdown\u201d in a recent paper by Camilli, Gordon, and Plump.1 This phenomenon will be explained by showing the effect of electrode spacing on the position of the maximum which occurs in the curve of sparkover voltage versus gas pressure. The d-c 60-cycle and impulse-breakdown voltage, as well as corona-onset voltage, will be discussed. The time required for corona stabilization to occur will be indicated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6371946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1953","publicationDate":"Nov. 1953","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"72","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric breakdown of sulfur hexafluoride in nonuniform fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric breakdown of sulfur hexafluoride in nonuniform fields","sourcePdf":"682689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047292S","chronDate":"Nov.  1953","isNumber":"6371916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6371946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6371949,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The synthetic plastics industry, which is the source of a number of useful dielectric materials, has recently produced a new and promising dielectric in film form known as polyethylene terephthalate or \"Mylar.\" This material is unusually strong, has a high softening point, and is available in very thin films which makes it especially suitable for capacitor insulation. The electrical characteristics of capacitors wound with Mylar film are likewise promising. As compared to mineral-oil-impregnated paper capacitors, unimpregnated Mylar capacitors exhibit higher dielectric strength, higher insulation resistance, and can be operated at higher ambient temperatures. Their loss characteristics are comparable with those of impregnated paper and the capacitance stability over the usual range of ambient temperatures approaches that of mica capacitors. Mylar is relatively nonhygroscopic and tests indicate that for moderate atmospheric conditions capacitors made from it do not require additional moisture protection. The film can be metallized readily by current techniques and, when used in metallized capacitors, appears to possess advantages over metallized paper in several respects.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1953.6371969","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6371960/06371969.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1953.6371969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6371960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polyethylene terephthalate - Its use as a capacitor dielectric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6371969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1953","displayDocTitle":"Polyethylene terephthalate - Its use as a capacitor dielectric","volume":"72","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1953","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyethylene terephthalate - Its use as a capacitor dielectric","sourcePdf":"033037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032132S","chronDate":"March  1953","isNumber":"6371960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","articleId":"6371969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6371972,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The first is a synchroscope. The bus-bar voltage causes the beam to trace a circle, while the incoming machine voltage gives a pulse every cycle. The pulse is either applied to the Y-deflection plates or to the grid of the tube. In the first case it appears as a \u201cpip\u201d rotating round the circle, while in the latter case a luminous spot is seen to trace a circle. The behavior of both the pip and the spot is similar to that of the pointer of an ordinary synchroscope. The second apparatus is an automatic synchronizer. It is based on the same principle as the synchroscope, but uses a special cathode-ray tube in which the fluorescent screen is replaced by two collecting electrodes. When the pulse is applied to the grid of the tube, the beam current flows to one electrode or the other, and when it flows to the proper electrode, it causes a relay to operate which in turn causes the synchronizing circuit breaker to close. Both apparatus are discussed, and a description including the design data of an actual experimental synchroscope is given.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6371999","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6371999/06372000.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1953.6372000","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1953.6372000","startPage":"217","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cathode-ray synchroscope and automatic synchronizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1953","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372000/","displayDocTitle":"Cathode-ray synchroscope and automatic synchronizer","isJournal":true,"volume":"72","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"July 1953","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cathode-ray synchroscope and automatic synchronizer","sourcePdf":"217223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016143S","chronDate":"July  1953","isNumber":"6371999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","articleId":"6372000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372010,"authors":[{"name":"W.

There are those who may ask, what is civil defense and why does it need communications? Let us consider first, what civil defense is. Briefly, civil defense may be described as the protection of the home front by civilians, acting under civil authority, to minimize casualties and war damage and to preserve the maximum civilian support of the war effort. When a country is under threatened or actual attack, civil defense becomes a full partner of the military in the defense of that country. In recent years civil defense has grown in importance because the progress of air warfare has increased the possibilities of attacks on the civil populace. Industries, vital facilities, and population centers are all likely targets for hostile attack.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1953.6372012","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6371999/06372012.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1953.6372012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6371999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communications for civil defense","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1953","displayDocTitle":"Communications for civil defense","volume":"72","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1953","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications for civil defense","sourcePdf":"315326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015364S","chronDate":"July  1953","isNumber":"6371999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","articleId":"6372012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372020,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Most of the work has been done on germanium and silicon and as a result these data have led to a better understanding of the mechanism of electric conduction in semiconductors as well as an explanation of their rectification properties. Data such as these are lacking for selenium. The development of the selenium rectifier industry, however, during the past decade has stimulated an interest in its semiconducting properties. A limited amount of research work has been done on both single crystal and microcrystalline selenium, thinking that perhaps such data would aid in understanding the mechanism of conduction and also aid in overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in the manufacture of rectifiers. Several researchers have studied the electrical properties of single crystals of selenium with the thought that such data would serve to explain the electrical properties of microcrystalline selenium. These data have not materially clarified the situation. In view of these facts, and also since selenium exists in the microcrystalline state in selenium rectifiers, it would seem that measurements on the electrical properties of microcrystalline material would be the most practical contribution to existing data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1954","publicationDate":"March 1954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"73","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Electrical properties of microcrystalline selenium","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical properties of microcrystalline selenium","sourcePdf":"038045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031265S","chronDate":"March  1954","isNumber":"6372098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","articleId":"6372107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372108,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In electric machines such as motors, generators, and transformers, the machine parts exposed to variable fields are made up of laminations so as to break up the eddy-current paths and avoid losses. Yet, in parts of these machines, solid metallic structures do occur which are exposed to alternating fields and which it is impossible to laminate. Among these are end plates of rotors and stators in the field of the end turns, and transformer tanks in the field of current leads. Similarly, in buildings of reinforced steel construction, heavy current leads may cause eddy-current losses in the steel girders. Finally, eddy currents may be excited in sea water or in the earth, either under conditions of zero-phase short-circuit currents in power lines or when alternating currents are provided with ground leads. In problems of interference between power and telephone lines, the distribution of eddy currents and their effect on the interference factors are of interest.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6372118","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6372118/06372119.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1954.6372119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1954.6372119","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eddy-current losses in a semi-infinite solid due to a nearby alternating current","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1954","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372119/","displayDocTitle":"Eddy-current losses in a semi-infinite solid due to a nearby alternating current","isJournal":true,"volume":"73","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"May 1954","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eddy-current losses in a semi-infinite solid due to a nearby alternating current","sourcePdf":"097106.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021995S","chronDate":"May  1954","isNumber":"6372118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6372119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372127,"authors":[{"name":"Howard G.

Such a smooth flow through the system can be approached by maintaining the impedances throughout the system resistive over the desired performance frequency band. This in turn dictates the avoidance of resonant components since such resonant elements tend to introduce high reactance slopes into the system impedances requiring careful compensation in the design. The case of the uniform transmission line with distributed constants properly arranged so as to minimize reflections is perhaps the ideal example of such a system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1954","publicationDate":"May 1954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"73","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-gain side-firing helical antennas for ultrahigh-frequency television broadcasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-gain side-firing helical antennas for ultrahigh-frequency television broadcasting","sourcePdf":"135138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036966S","chronDate":"May  1954","isNumber":"6372118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","articleId":"6372127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6372130,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For mineral-oil immersant, the figures were independent of voltage polarity, while for Askarel immersant, the figures depended markedly on voltage polarity.

The pressboard was replaced by a polystyrene sheet and the upper electrode was raised above the sheet to permit the liquid to fill the intervening space. Ionization records were obtained on the photographic paper at threshold stresses which, in most cases, were lower than either the breakdown stress with the polystyrene barrier present or the breakdown stress of the oil without the barrier. The threshold impulse-ionization stress was the same when the photographic paper was under the transparent barrier and not in contact with the stressed oil layer.

Following the appearance of Rosenberg's work,2 others\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n\u203e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n have made an academic problem of substantiating it or elaborating upon it. Recently the damping effect of eddy currents in the solid yokes and pole pieces of d-c machines has become important. Still more recently, it has been recognized that the saturation effect is important in computing the core losses in thin steel or alloy sheets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1954","publicationDate":"July 1954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"73","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Eddy-current phenomena in ferromagnetic materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eddy-current phenomena in ferromagnetic materials","sourcePdf":"226235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021343S","chronDate":"July  1954","isNumber":"6372137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"34","articleId":"6372143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372154,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In general, a switching network involves not only the network configuration and the switching elements but also the states of transmission through the network. A survey of the literature will show however, that it is generally (tacitly) assumed that the states of transmission through a switching network are limited to two values. For relays the two states are usually the establishment and the opening of a d-c path through the network; for electronic gate circuits these two states are usually the presence and absence of a pulse. An essentially similar situation prevails on the states of the switching elements in a network. For relays, a relay contact is either open or closed; for electronic gates, an input or output lead either carries a pulse or does not carry one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1956","publicationDate":"July 1956","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"75","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Several-valued combinational switching circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Several-valued combinational switching circuits","sourcePdf":"278283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024509S","chronDate":"July  1956","isNumber":"6372524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6372528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6372534,"authors":[{"name":"Chaang Huang","affiliation":["Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., Woburn, Mass."],"firstName":"Chaang","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Melvin Marshall","affiliation":["Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., Woburn, Mass."],"firstName":"Melvin","lastName":"Marshall"},{"name":"B.

From well-known theory, rigorous determination of these electrical quantities hinges on determination of the corresponding electrostatic potential function V. However, determination of the function for a specified plane area is of such mathematical difficulty that solution to date has been achieved for only one plane area, the elliptical disk of which the circular disk is a special case. In consequence, explicit equations for the charge distribution and electrical capacitance are known only for these two plane areas. However, need of accurate knowledge of the capacitance of a rectangular plane area, or of a certain parameter1 equal in magnitude to the capacitance, occurs in numerous physical problems. (Thus, the normal force R on a thin rectangular plate moving in the direction of its normal with a velocity V through a liquid of viscosity \u03bc is R = 8\u03c0\u03bcCV, where C is a parameter equal to the capacitance of a rectangular planar conductor of the same dimensions as the thin plate.) To cite an example of much current interest in electrical engineering, a knowledge of the capacitance of rectangular plates is required in the rational design of grounding systems for high-voltage power systems.2\u20134 Accordingly, it is obviously most desirable to have in hand curves which readily afford values of the capacitance with accuracy sufficient for design purposes. Precisely such a set of curves is advanced in this paper, the essential content of which may be summarized as follows: The method of subareas, earlier formulated and used by the authors to obtain excellent approximate solutions of the difficult, long-standing problems of determination of the capacitance and charge distribution of a plane annulus5 and a cube,6,7 is recast to enable solution of the present problem. Therewith equations for the capacitance and charge distribution of an arbitrarily dimensional rectangular area are formulated; and the solutions of these equations, as effected through use of International Business Machines equipment, are then utilized to plot a universal curve of capacitance versus width/height from which can be read the capacitance of any specified rectangular area with sufficient accuracy for most design purposes. Corroborative of the correctness of the solution in general, this curve falls within the narrow upper and lower bounds to be calculated from the known expressions for the capacitances of the circumscribed and inscribed ellipses. Finally, comparison of this universal curve with the corresponding curve plotted from Howe'8 wellknown and much used expression for the approximate capacitance of a rectangular area reveals that this expression yields values in considerable error over much of the range of w/h (width/height).","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1957.6372589","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6372567/06372589.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1957.6372589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6372567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate determination of the capacitance of a thin rectangular plate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6372589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6372589/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate determination of the capacitance of a thin rectangular plate","volume":"75","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Jan. 1957","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate determination of the capacitance of a thin rectangular plate","sourcePdf":"761766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019251S","chronDate":"Jan.  1957","isNumber":"6372567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6372589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6372672,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The blocking voltage is defined here as the forward voltage at a P-N junction at which the incremental conductance is a hundredfold greater than the incremental conductance at zero voltage. By proper circuit connections, the blocking voltage may be utilized to block injection of minority carriers in a semiconductor device until the voltage applied to the device exceeds a peak value. Such a device may exhibit low or negative a-c resistance after the peak value is exceeded. It is shown in the following discussion how the blocking-voltage concept may be applied to obtain negative resistance behavior from a junction transistor, a point-contact transistor, a modified double-base diode, or a modified tetrode.

These systems are used for industrial, educational, and entertainment purposes, and descriptions of many of them have appeared in the literature.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n\u203e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n This paper will discuss two problems that affect the design of any closed-circuit TV system: thermal noise and intermodulation products created by amplifier non-linearity.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1961.6373006","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6373001/06373006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1961.6373006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373001","startPage":"486","endPage":"491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise and intermodulation problems in multichannel closed-circuit television systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noise and intermodulation problems in multichannel closed-circuit television systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1961","isJournal":true,"volume":"80","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Nov. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise and intermodulation problems in multichannel closed-circuit television systems","sourcePdf":"486491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02543S","chronDate":"Nov.  1961","isNumber":"6373001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6373006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373026,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Of particular interest has been the evaluation of noise originating from harmonic components present in power system voltages and currents. Magnetic fields set up by power currents, and electric fields set up by power voltages, tend to induce voltages in nearby telephone conductors. Even a small transfer of power at harmonic frequencies in the voice band can cause trouble. For example an input of 400 \u03bcwatts (micromicrowatts), or 26 db (decibels) above reference noise, into a telephone set at 1,000 cps (cycles per second) will give an audible tone. To put such a tone on all of the 60 million telephones in the United States at once would require just 24 milliwatts, transmission losses neglected.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373020","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6373020/06373026.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1961.6373026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1961.6373026","startPage":"659","endPage":"664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telephone influence factor (TIF) and its measurement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373026/","displayDocTitle":"Telephone influence factor (TIF) and its measurement","isJournal":true,"volume":"79","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telephone influence factor (TIF) and its measurement","sourcePdf":"659664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033744S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"6373020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6373026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373036,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The forms of the equations relating these variables are found to hold in a variety of cases, even though assumed boundary conditions are not observed experimentally.

This paper presents a varied assortment of current problems including safety grounding, grounding versus bonding, relative hazard of 120-versus 240-volt a-c systems, and double insulation for appliances and hand tools. It deplores the lack of electrical safety in both laboratories and schools of electrical engineering, and concludes with the recent development of differential circuit breakers. The new miniature circuit breaker is considered a major breakthrough in electrical safety for low-voltage utilization circuits for both the home and industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6367273/6373208/06373218.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Part I: Communication and Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1962.6373218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1962.6373218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements in electrical safety","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hazards","Electric shock","Grounding","Circuit breakers","Wires","Home appliances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1962","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1962","displayDocTitle":"Improvements in electrical safety","volume":"81","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1962","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements in electrical safety","sourcePdf":"121127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019018S","chronDate":"May  1962","isNumber":"6373208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6367273","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6373218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373245,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Most communication problems are, broadly speaking, engineering problems; that is, they deal with the construction and evaluation of new methods of communication, using one's knowledge of \"Nature,\" acquired elsewhere. Our problem is, broadly speaking, physical; we seek to improve our knowledge, or at least our description, of \"Nature\" by using models in which some statistical concepts, developed in the study of recent communication problems, are used side by side with such concepts of physics as were already used to solve older engineering problems. This difference of purpose will also explain an unessential character of this paper: the calculations are much simpler than in other papers of the symposium, because here one could choose the problems leading to simple theories by the present methods (but not by previous ones), whereas in other papers the problems were imposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373405/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1954","publicationDate":"March 1954","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"3","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Simpie games of strategy occurring in communication through natural languages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simpie games of strategy occurring in communication through natural languages","sourcePdf":"0124mand.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053266S","chronDate":"March  1954","isNumber":"6373396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547596","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6373405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373409,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is of interest to examine this problem for its own sake, not only as indicative of optimum circuit practice, but, more important, in order to make clear the fundamental accuracy limitations and the manner in which these limitations depend upon signal and noise parameters. The consideration of this paper is limited to the case where there is no doubt as to the existence nor approximate position of a pulse but where the accuracy of determination of pulse position is limited by noise. This case is therefore more representative of the problems of high accuracy systems such as Loran or shoran than of radar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1954","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373409/","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1954","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum pulse-time determination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum pulse-time determination","sourcePdf":"0151mall.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027639S","chronDate":"March  1954","isNumber":"6373396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4547596","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6373409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373416,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Generally one state will involve transistor operation in or near saturation and the other state will involve transistor cutoff. For simple circuits, such as elementary pulse amplifiers, the switching action is under direct control of the input and is readily understandable.1 The situation is not as simple for relaxation type of circuits such as multivibrators, flip-flops, and blocking oscillators. For these circuits, the input serves as a trigger to raise the circuit into an unstable region of operation. The instability is due to a positive feedback circuit arrangement, and the regenerative process which results produces the change of state of the transistors.","doi":"10.1109/TCT.1955.6373422","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/8148/6373410/06373422.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1955.6373422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regeneration analysis of junction transistor multivibrators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1955","displayDocTitle":"Regeneration analysis of junction transistor multivibrators","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1955","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regeneration analysis of junction transistor multivibrators","sourcePdf":"0171pede.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032509S","chronDate":"June  1955","isNumber":"6373410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8148","articleId":"6373422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373669,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6373669/6373669-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Liu received his B.Sc degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2010.

In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called \"outage-energy\" region and \"rate-energy\" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. The effects of circuit energy consumption at the receiver on the achievable rate-energy trade-offs are also characterized. Our results provide useful guidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by opportunistic WEH.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.120500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06373669.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.120500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Information Transfer with Opportunistic Energy Harvesting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Information Transfer with Opportunistic Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373669/","publicationDate":"January 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13250941","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373669/","volume":"12","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Information Transfer with Opportunistic Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"288-tw1301-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06899S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"512","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6373669","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6373672,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hung","lastName":"Wei","id":"38263283500"},{"name":"Ping-Chen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Chen","lastName":"Lin","id":"38239034500"},{"name":"Ray-Guang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ray-Guang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37335957200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6373672","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":489},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Wireless communication","Equations","OFDM","Throughput","Indexes","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implicit message transmission","OFDMA system","efficient random access scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","uniform backoff policy","RACH","access delay performance","random access channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access delay","binary exponential backoff","uniform backoff"]}],"abstract":"In [1], the throughput and access delay performance of the RACH in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system is analyzed.

In the scenario there is a primary transmitter subject to random channel fading, with full spectrum rights available, and a secondary transmitter without any spectrum rights, which offers its cooperation to the primary transmitter in exchange for a share of the resulting resource gains. Two decision-making schemes, based on different levels of channel knowledge, are considered in the primary transmitter. These are knowledge of the statistics of random fading (averages) and full knowledge of instantaneous channel state. The contributions of this paper are the radio leasing scenario itself, which, unlike previous approaches in cognitive radio, is not based on game theory, and the statistical characterization of the resource gains achieved in this scenario using cooperative diversity for spectrum leasing under diverse channel conditions and the aforementioned decision-making schemes. Analytical expressions are obtained for the probability of cooperation, the mutual information probability density function and its average, and the proportion of resource gains achieved for the statistical and instantaneous channel knowledge schemes. We identify the conditions for resource gains: for statistical channel knowledge to suffice, the primary link must be of low quality, whereas for instantaneous channel knowledge, although resource gains are achieved in any situation, they increase as the primary channel gets worse.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.110842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"40","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06373673.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Cooperative Diversity to Cognitive Radio Leasing: Model and Analytical Characterization of Resource Gains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6373673/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Cooperative Diversity to Cognitive Radio Leasing: Model and Analytical Characterization of Resource Gains","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250944","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Cooperative Diversity to Cognitive Radio Leasing: Model and Analytical Characterization of Resource Gains","sourcePdf":"040-tw1301-cuba.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094783S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6373673","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6373674,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadali Mohammadi","affiliation":["K.

The penalty is defined as the gap between the information rate with perfect channel state information and that when the source-destination, source-relay and relay-destination channels are unknown at the receiving nodes. We prove that this gap in the cooperative system is the sum of gaps in the source-destination (single-hop) and source-relay-destination (dual-hop) channels. Under the assumption that the source and destination are mobile and the relay is stationary, we derive a closed-form accurate approximation for the asymptotic penalty of the mobile-to-mobile single-hop channel, which can also be used in computing asymptotic penalties for the mobile-fixed-mobile dual-hop channel. AF relaying induces non-Gaussian noise at the destination and hence, the penalty of the dual-hop channel is computed semi-analytically. We discuss a numerical technique for evaluation of destination noise entropy. One main observation of this paper is that non-negligible amplified relay noise can increase the cooperation information rate penalty of up to 1.5 times, as compared to non-relayed transmission. We provide extensive simulation results that characterize the behavior of penalty and include other mobility models for the source, relay and destination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Unknown Time-varying Fading on the Information Rates of Amplify and Forward Cooperative Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.12.112057","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06373674.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.12.112057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373674/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Unknown Time-varying Fading on the Information Rates of Amplify and Forward Cooperative Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6373674/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250945","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Unknown Time-varying Fading on the Information Rates of Amplify and Forward Cooperative Systems","sourcePdf":"146-tw1301-moham.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099528S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6373674","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373676,"authors":[{"name":"Junni Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA","Key Laboratory of Special Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6373676/6373676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junni Zou (M'07) received the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

In this paper, we address the power allocation problem in a network-coded multiuser two-way relaying network, where multiple pair users communicate with their partners via a common relay node, and compete for the transmit power of the relay. An auction-based power allocation scheme is proposed, in which two users in each pair bid as a single player for a maximum utility of the whole pair, and share the total pair payment in proportion to the amount of power they obtained. The convergence of the proposed auction game (i.e., the convergence to a unique Nash Equilibrium) is theoretically proved by using a standard function. Moreover, the outage behavior is systematically analyzed and a closed form of the pair outage probability is derived. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.111725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"31","endPage":"39","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06373676.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auction-Based Power Allocation for Multiuser Two-Way Relaying Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6373676/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Auction-Based Power Allocation for Multiuser Two-Way Relaying Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250947","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auction-Based Power Allocation for Multiuser Two-Way Relaying Networks","sourcePdf":"031-tw1301-zou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110443S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6373676","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6373677,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulmohsen Mutairi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6373677/6373677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdulmohsen Mutairi received his BS degree in Computer Engineering and MS degree in Computer Networks both from King Fahad University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia in 2001 and 2008 respectively.

OFDMA-Aloha combines the flexibility of OFDMA with basic Aloha's collision resolution mechanism over sub-carriers, in an attempt to reduce packet collisions and achieve faster retransmission. However, this comes at the expense of a larger slot size, due to lower channel rates per subcarrier. The above gives rise to a fundamental question: whether to use a single wide-band Aloha channel and retransmit via random back-off in next K time slots, or to retransmit immediately in one of K narrow-band sub-channels which are each 1/K slower (OFDMA-Aloha)? We answer this question, by analyzing the two protocols: Aloha and OFDMA-Aloha under the same total bandwidth and load conditions. We first derive the exact distribution of the packet access delay of OFDMA-Aloha in the saturated case. Then, we extend the analysis to the unsaturated case and derive the mean queue length and packet delay by decomposing the system of interfering queues into multiple independent queues utilizing the symmetry in our system. Our results show that if the network is already saturated, channelization does not bring substantial reduction in the collision rate to the point where it outweighs the effect of expanded slot size. In this case the single channel Aloha performs better than OFDMA-Aloha especially when the gap between the number of channels and the number users is large. On other hand, when the network is lightly loaded, OFDMA-Aloha enjoys smaller packet delays, but not for long as it saturates faster than the single channel Aloha.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06373677.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.111776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.113012.111776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Analysis of OFDMA-Aloha","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Bandwidth","Queueing analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Transient analysis","Radiation detectors","Femtocells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay analysis","OFDMA-Aloha","broadband access","fine granularity","multiuser access","Aloha collision resolution mechanism","packet collision reduction","single-wideband Aloha channel","random back-off","narrow-band subchannels","packet access delay","mean queue length","packet delay","channelization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Aloha","multi-channel MAC","fast retrial algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Delay Analysis of OFDMA-Aloha","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6373677/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250948","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Analysis of OFDMA-Aloha","sourcePdf":"089-tw1301-mutairi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078208S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6373677","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373678,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Yun Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6373678/6373678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Yun Chen was born in Tainan, Taiwan in 1982.

A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov equations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate the case where linear coupling among spatial modes of the fiber is weak and derive new Manakov equations after averaging over random birefringence fluctuations. Such an averaging reduces the number of intermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms vanish. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their effectiveness is reduced. We verify the accuracy of new Manakov equations by simulating the transmission of multiple 114-Gb/s bit streams in the PDM-QPSK format over different modes of a multimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by solving the full stochastic equations. The agreement is excellent in all cases studied. A major benefit of the new Manakov equations is that they typically reduce the computation time by more than a factor of 10. Our results show that birefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of fiber nonlinearities. The extent of improvement depends on the fiber design and how many spatial modes are used for SDM transmission. We also consider the case where all spatial modes experience strong random linear coupling modeled using a random matrix. We derive new Manakov equations in this regime and show that the impact of some nonlinear effects can be reduced relatively to single-modes fibers. Finally, we extend our analysis to multicore fibers and show that the Manakov equations obtained in the strong- and weak-coupling regimes can still be used depending on the extent of coupling among fiber cores.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2231401","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6397595/06373681.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2231401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Propagation in Multimode and Multicore Fibers: Generalization of the Manakov Equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373681/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Propagation in Multimode and Multicore Fibers: Generalization of the Manakov Equations","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13190931","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373681/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Propagation in Multimode and Multicore Fibers: Generalization of the Manakov Equations","sourcePdf":"jlt-mumtaz-2231401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088555S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6397595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"6397595","articleId":"6373681","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6373682,"authors":[{"name":"Shibnath Pathak","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University-IMEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Shibnath Pathak received the M.

We embed the Fisher criterion into the LRC as a novel discriminant regression analysis method. The LDRC attempts to maximize the ratio of the between-class reconstruction error (BCRE) over the within-class reconstruction error (WCRE) to find an optimal projection matrix for the LRC such that the LRC on that subspace can achieve a high discrimination for classification. Then, the projected coefficients are executed by the LRC for face recognition. Extensive experiments carried out on the FERET and AR face databases show that the LDRC performs better than the related regression based algorithms and shows a promising ability for face recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6373697/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13156803","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Discriminant Regression Classification for Face Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Discriminant Regression Classification for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-yang-2230257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062222S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6353967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6353967","articleId":"6373697","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6373714,"authors":[{"name":"Payman Aflaki","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Payman","lastName":"Aflaki","id":"37543020600"},{"name":"Miska Hannuksela","affiliation":["Nokia, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Miska","lastName":"Hannuksela","id":"37295134600"},{"name":"Dmytro Rusanovskyy","affiliation":["Nokia, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Dmytro","lastName":"Rusanovskyy","id":"37397446500"},{"name":"Moncef Gabbouj","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Moncef","lastName":"Gabbouj","id":"37276556200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6373714","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":738},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Depth-enhanced 3-D video coding includes coding of texture views and associated depth maps. It has been observed that coding of depth map at reduced resolution provides better rate-distortion performance on synthesized views comparing to utilization of full resolution (FR) depth maps in many coding scenarios based on the Advanced Video Coding (H.264/AVC) standard. Conventional techniques for down and upsampling do not take typical characteristics of depth maps, such as distinct edges and smooth regions within depth objects, into account. Hence, more efficient down and upsampling tools, capable of preserving edges better, are needed. In this letter, novel non-linear methods to down and upsample depth maps are presented. Bitrate comparison of synthesized views, including texture and depth map bitstreams, is presented against a conventional linear resampling algorithm. Objective results show an average bitrate reduction of 5.29% and 3.31% for the proposed down and upsampling methods with ratio \u00bd, respectively, comparing to the anchor method. Moreover, a joint utilization of the proposed down and upsampling brings up to 20% and on average 7.35% bitrate reduction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Transform coding","Encoding","Signal processing algorithms","Image coding","Bit rate","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image resolution","image sampling","image texture","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full resolution nonlinear depth map resampling","depth-enhanced 3D video coding","image texture view coding","image resolution","rate-distortion performance","FR depth map","H.264-AVC standard","advanced video coding standard","edge preservation","nonlinear method","average bitrate reduction","upsampling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth map","MVC","nonlinear","resampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2228189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6353967/06373714.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2228189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Depth Map Resampling for Depth-Enhanced 3-D Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Depth Map Resampling for Depth-Enhanced 3-D Video Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373714/","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373714/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13156804","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Depth Map Resampling for Depth-Enhanced 3-D Video Coding","sourcePdf":"lsp-aflaki-2228189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053952S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6353967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6353967","articleId":"6373714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6373728,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Noorshams","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nima Noorshams received his B.

At the core of the BP message updates, when applied to a graphical model involving discrete variables with pairwise interactions, lies a matrix-vector product with complexity that is quadratic in the state dimension \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n, and requires transmission of a (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n-1)-dimensional vector of real numbers (messages) to its neighbors. Since various applications involve very large state dimensions, such computation and communication complexities can be prohibitively complex. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity variant of BP, referred to as stochastic belief propagation (SBP). As suggested by the name, it is an adaptively randomized version of the BP message updates in which each node passes randomly chosen information to each of its neighbors. The SBP message updates reduce the computational complexity (per iteration) from quadratic to linear in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n, without assuming any particular structure of the potentials, and also reduce the communication complexity significantly, requiring only log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n bits transmission per edge. Moreover, we establish a number of theoretical guarantees for the performance of SBP, showing that it converges almost surely to the BP fixed point for any tree-structured graph, and for any graph with cycles satisfying a contractivity condition.

A multilevel-modular capacitor-clamped dc-dc converter (MMCCC) is one of the most promising topologies among them with simple control and reduced switch current stress. This paper presents the optimal design considerations for an MMCCC to achieve the highest efficiency and the smallest size. In order to design the converter with the highest efficiency, the analytical power loss equation of an MMCCC should be derived. By considering the stray inductance in the circuit, the optimal design approach should be divided into two cases, overdamped case and underdamped case. The converter can be designed to achieve high efficiency in both cases by varying circuit parameters. If the circuit is designed in overdamped case, huge electrolytic capacitor bank has to be used to achieve high efficiency, which will increase the total converter size. If the circuit is designed in underdamped case, small-size multilayer ceramic capacitor can be utilized due to the low capacitance requirement. Although relatively high switching frequency is required in underdamped case due to practical considerations, zero-current switching (ZCS) can be achieved for all the switching devices which minimize the converter switching loss. Therefore, the optimal design point of an MMCCC with the smallest size and the highest efficiency should be selected at the underdamped case with ZCS for all the switches. Simulation results are provided to validate the design. A prototype of an MMCCC by using the proposed optimal design procedure is built.

This is achieved by modeling the terminals and their corresponding receivers at the base station as economic and rational agents that engage in a noncooperative game. In the proposed game, each one trades off its available resources (transmit power and detection strategy) so as to selfishly maximize its own revenue (in terms of probability of correct detection) while saving as much energy as possible and satisfying quality-of-service requirements given in terms of probability of false alarm and timing estimation accuracy. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game are studied. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition on the system parameters is given for the equilibrium to exist. An iterative and distributed algorithm based on best-response dynamics (at the transmit side) and a practical parameter estimation (at the receive side) are proposed to achieve the equilibrium point. Numerical results are used to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make comparisons with existing alternatives in terms of power consumption, synchronization time, and estimation accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach for Energy-Efficient Contention-Based Synchronization in OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2231679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6451284/06373741.pdf","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2231679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Approach for Energy-Efficient Contention-Based Synchronization in OFDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6373741/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","publicationDate":"March1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13306719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Approach for Energy-Efficient Contention-Based Synchronization in OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-bacci-2231679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11124S","chronDate":"March1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6451284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6451284","articleId":"6373741","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373744,"authors":[{"name":"Vijayvaradharaj T.

For the Denoise-And-Forward (DNF) protocol, it was shown by Koike-Akino that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay greatly reduces the impact of Multiple Access Interference at the relay. The harmful effect of the deep channel fade conditions can be effectively mitigated by proper choice of these network coding maps at the relay. Alternatively, in this paper we propose a Distributed Space Time Coding (DSTC) scheme, which effectively removes most of the deep fade channel conditions at the transmitting nodes itself without any CSIT and without any need to adaptively change the network coding map used at the relay. It is shown that the deep fades occur when the channel fade coefficient vector falls in a finite number of vector subspaces of \\BBC\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n , which are referred to as the singular fade subspaces. DSTC design criterion referred to as the singularity minimization criterion under which the number of such vector subspaces are minimized is obtained. Also, a criterion to maximize the coding gain of the DSTC is obtained. Explicit low decoding complexity DSTC designs which satisfy the singularity minimization criterion and maximize the coding gain for QAM and PSK signal sets are provided. Simulation results show that at high Signal to Noise Ratio, the DSTC scheme provides large gains when compared to the conventional Exclusive OR network code and performs better than the adaptive network coding scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6417036/06373744.pdf","startPage":"980","endPage":"991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2231677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2231677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6417036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Space Time Coding for Wireless Two-Way Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Relays","Vectors","Encoding","Adaptive systems","Protocols","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","decoding","fading channels","interference (signal)","minimisation","multi-access systems","network coding","phase shift keying","protocols","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal processing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed space time coding","wireless two-way relaying","wireless two-way relay channel","two-way data transfer","end nodes","denoise-and-forward protocol","DNF protocol","multiple access interference","deep channel fade conditions","network coding maps","DSTC scheme","deep fade channel conditions","transmitting nodes","CSIT","channel fade coefficient vector","vector subspaces","singular fade subspaces","DSTC design criterion","singularity minimization criterion","coding gain","low decoding complexity","DSTC designs","QAM signal sets","PSK signal sets","signal to noise ratio","adaptive network coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed space time coding","physical layer network coding","wireless two-way relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Space Time Coding for Wireless Two-Way Relaying","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6373744/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13251077","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Space Time Coding for Wireless Two-Way Relaying","sourcePdf":"tsp-rajan-2231677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096133S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6417036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6417036","articleId":"6373744","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6373747,"authors":[{"name":"Leslie N.

The relay determines the prices for relaying the users' information, depending on its available resources and the users' demands. Subsequently, each user maximizes its own utility function by determining the optimum power and bandwidth to buy from the relay. The utility function of the user is formulated as a joint concave function in power and bandwidth. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are investigated using the concavity of the utility function and the exact potential game associated with the proposed utility function. The NE solution can be obtained in a centralized manner, which requires full knowledge of all channel gains of all users, which may be difficult to obtain in practice. In this sense, a distributed algorithm can be applied to obtain power and bandwidth allocations with minimum information exchange between the relay and the users. Similarly, the optimum prices for the power and bandwidth can also be obtained in a distributed manner. The convergence of the algorithms is investigated using the Jacobian matrix at the NE. Numerical simulations are used to verify the validation of the proposed framework.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bandwidth","Games","Nash equilibrium","Pricing","Resource management","Channel allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","bandwidth allocation","cooperative communication","distributed algorithms","game theory","Jacobian matrices","numerical analysis","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","bandwidth allocation","amplify-and-forward cooperative communications","Stackelberg game","AF cooperative communication scheme","Stackelberg market framework","multiple users","relay","users information","utility function","optimum power","joint concave function","Nash equilibrium","concavity","potential game","NE solution","centralized manner","channel gains","distributed algorithm","minimum information exchange","Jacobian matrix","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative communications","distributed algorithm","Nash equilibrium (NE)","potential game","Stackelberg game"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2231104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06373749.pdf","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2231104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power and Bandwidth Allocation for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Using Stackelberg Game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Bandwidth Allocation for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Using Stackelberg Game","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373749/","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373749/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13487030","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power and Bandwidth Allocation for Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Communications Using Stackelberg Game","sourcePdf":"tvt-barhumi-2231104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097578S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6373749","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6373750,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6373750/6373750-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huiqin Du (M\u201911) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic information science and technology from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in radio-frequency communication systems from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2010.","From August 2010 to August 2012, she was a Research Fellow with the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K. She is currently a Research Fellow with the Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh.

Standard cognitive radio techniques require perfect channel state information (CSI) and are sensitive to the errors in channel estimation. In practice, such errors are inevitable due to finite feedback resources, quantization errors, and other physical constraints. As a result, robustness has become a crucial issue. Under the assumption of norm-bounded channel imperfections, we develop a robust energy-aware design that strives to admit the maximum number of served SUs and enhance the transmit rate of the secondary links while using the least transmit power while imposing the upper limit of the interference temperature to the PU. A utility function is introduced to achieve the multi-objective function by dealing with the tradeoff between maximizing the transmit rate and minimizing the transmit power. Instead of using the deterministic target, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) target becomes one of the ongoing optimization variables, which is dynamically adapted with the channel condition under the pre-specified bit-error-rate (BER) requirement, and acts as admission control implicitly, i.e., the cognitive link is not allowed to transmit as long as its SINR falls to zero. Due to its nonconvexity and NP-hardness, the underlying problem is reformulated in a semidefinite programming (SDP) form and solved via an iterative bisection search approach. Simulation results are provided to validate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2231103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06373750.pdf","startPage":"1707","endPage":"1718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2231103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Utility Maximization and Admission Control for a MIMO Cognitive Radio Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373750/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Utility Maximization and Admission Control for a MIMO Cognitive Radio Network","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487031","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373750/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Utility Maximization and Admission Control for a MIMO Cognitive Radio Network","sourcePdf":"tvt-du-2231103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089394S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6373750","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373751,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Mahdi Mousavi Toroujeni","affiliation":["Cognitive Telecommunication Research Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University G.

In the proposed scheme, the Primary User (PU) leases some parts of its available resources (in both time and frequency) as a revenue of cooperation to the Secondary Users (SUs) who act as relays for the primary transmission. The optimization of parameters that control the amount of leased resources from the PU to the SU is investigated. An iterative framework is proposed for the PU to find its appropriate relays. Moreover, a dynamic noncooperative game is considered at the relays to compete among themselves for controlling their powers and the Nash Equilibrium (NE) is suggested as the solution of this competition. Analytical results show that the PU achieves a higher data rate by this cooperation process compared with the case where there is no cooperation.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2231102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6530672/06373751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2231102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530672","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Leasing for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Leasing for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2013","accessionNumber":"13563735","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6373751/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Leasing for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-sadough-2231102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112663S","chronDate":"Jun  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6530672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6530672","articleId":"6373751","onlineDate":"03 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6373760,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Hershberg","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6373760/6373760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Hershberg (S'06\u2013M'12) received H.B.S. degrees in both electrical engineering and computer engineering from Oregon State University, Corvallis, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University in 2012.

A basic operational theory is established, and the core benefits of this technique are identified. Measured results from two separate ring amplifier based pipelined ADCs are presented. The first prototype IC, a simple 10.5-bit, 61.5 dB SNDR pipelined ADC which uses only ring amplifiers, is used to demonstrate the core benefits. The second fabricated IC presented is a high-resolution pipelined ADC which employs the technique of Split-CLS to perform efficient, accurate amplification aided by ring amplifiers.

The 1.5-bit digital output of the digital SDM is converted to a three-level analog signal by a simple digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and then applied to an analog SDM. The analog SDM provides pulse density modulated (PDM) signal to drive a power switch. The PDM output is fed back to the input of the analog SDM in order to suppress the noise of the power switch. While the integrators of the analog SDM are implemented with switched-capacitor (SC) circuits for a well-defined frequency response of the modulator loop filter, the feedback path from the power switch output is realized with a continuous-time (CT) integrator for effective noise suppression. The class-D amplifier with PCM digital input has been implemented in a standard 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS process.

Unfortunately, conventional imaging with focused pulses can destroy a large fraction of the microbubbles it is trying to follow. Using coherent synthetic summation, ultrafast plane wave imaging could attain similar image quality, while reducing the peak acoustic pressure and bubble disruption. Method: In these experiments, microbubbles were flowed in a wall-less vessel phantom. Images were obtained on a programmable clinical scanner with a set of line-per-line focused pulses for conventional contrast imaging and with compounded plane wave transmission adapted for nonlinear imaging. Imaging was performed between 14 and 650 kPa peak negative pressure at 7.5 MHz. The disruption of the microbubbles was evaluated by comparing the microbubble intensity before and after acquisition of a set of 100 images at various pressures. Results: The acoustic intensity required to disrupt 50% of the microbubbles was 24 times higher with plane-wave imaging compared with conventional focused pulses. Although both imaging approaches yield similar resolution, at the same disruption level, plane-wave imaging showed better contrast. In particular, at similar disruption ratio (50% after 100 images), contrast-pulse sequencing (CPS) performed with plane waves displayed an improvement of 11 dB compared with conventional nonlinear imaging. Conclusion: In each resolution cell of the image, plane-wave imaging spread the spatial peak acoustic intensity over more pulses, reducing the peak pressure and, hence, preserving the microbubbles. This method could contribute to molecular imaging by allowing the continuous monitoring of the accumulation of microbubbles with improved contrast.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6373777/06373790.pdf","startPage":"2676","endPage":"2683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373777","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound contrast plane wave imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Ultrasonic imaging","Decorrelation","Arrays","Molecular imaging","Imaging phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","blood vessels","bubbles","image resolution","medical image processing","phantoms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound contrast plane wave imaging","microbubble","wall-less vessel phantom","programmable clinical scanner","line-per-line focused pulse","compounded plane wave transmission","nonlinear imaging","microbubble intensity","contrast-pulse sequencing","image resolution cell","spatial peak acoustic intensity","molecular imaging","pressure 14 kPa to 650 kPa","frequency 7.5 MHz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Agar","Cellulose","Contrast Media","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Microbubbles","Phantoms, Imaging","Pressure","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound contrast plane wave imaging","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6373790/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13168276","pubMedId":"23221216","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound contrast plane wave imaging","sourcePdf":"t12c2676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078696S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6373777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6373777","articleId":"6373790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6373791,"authors":[{"name":"Pieter Kruizinga","affiliation":["Erasmus Medical Center, Thorax Center Biomedical Engineering, Rotterdam, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6373777/6373791/6373791-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pieter Kruizinga is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Thorax Center, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam.

First, the dynamic model of the PFNS is derived in detail. Then, to achieve robust, accurate trajectory-tracking performance, a nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (NTSMC) system is proposed for the tracking of the reference contours. The steady-state response of the control system can be improved effectively because of the addition of the nonsingularity in the NTSMC. Moreover, to relax the requirements of the bounds and discard the switching function in NTSMC, an INTSMC system using a multi-input-multioutput (MIMO) ENN estimator is proposed to improve the control performance and robustness of the PFNS. The ENN estimator is proposed to estimate the hysteresis phenomenon and lumped uncertainty, including the system parameters and external disturbance of the PFNS online. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the training of the parameters of the ENN online are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, two robust compensators are proposed to confront the minimum reconstructed errors in INTSMC. Finally, some experimental results for the tracking of various contours are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed INTSMC system for PFNS.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6373777/06373795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373777","startPage":"2716","endPage":"2730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control using MIMO elman neural network for piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control using MIMO elman neural network for piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13168281","pubMedId":"23221221","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6373795/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control using MIMO elman neural network for piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage","sourcePdf":"t12c2716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073853S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6373777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6373777","articleId":"6373795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6373831,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser K.

Due to the uniqueness of the time-varying UWB propagation mechanism, we consider the channel response as a time-scale domain tensor instead of a matrix, and define a time-scale domain MIMO-UWB channel representation. We use the tensor model to represent a typical Infostation channel and obtain the diversity gain, and invariably the range extension in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both the single-input-single-output (SISO) and MIMO cases at different data rates. Results show that at an acceptable SNR of say 12 dB and data rate of 55 Mbps, the coverage range can be extended from 15 m to well over 25 m using 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO. For 110 Mbps, the range can be extended from 10 m to 25 m.

There is a growing interest in cognitive radio (CR) to overcome a spectrum scarcity problem. The CR is intended to coexist with primary users (PUs) by using either of the white, grey or black spectrum holes by using the software and the hardware re-configurability. It is considered as a future radio technology that will be aware of its surrounding environment, internal state and can make the strategic decisions about its radio operating behavior to achieve the predefined objectives. The game theory is a dominating paradigm which can be used to analyze the strategic interaction for decision makers (cognitive nodes) in cooperative or competitive environments for complex decision situations. This contribution focuses firstly on how game theory can be applied in industrial wireless systems, especially concerning the interference reduction interests for mobile industrial applications and their real-time QoS requirements e.g. automated guided vehicles in industrial automation network for connecting the field devices: sensors and actuators. Secondly, it focuses on how the Bayesian games of incomplete information can be applied in industrial cognitive radio networks, where the moving nodes (e.g. Robotics) have some uncertainty about the other player's payoffs. The statistical learning techniques and a radio environment map (REM) can be used to map the uncertainties (by Bayes' rule).","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2012.6373837","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361516/6373809/06373837.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2012.6373837","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA)","startPage":"177","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game theory in wireless and cognitive radio networks - Coexistence perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6373837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Game theory in wireless and cognitive radio networks - Coexistence perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373837/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6373837/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171839","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game theory in wireless and cognitive radio networks - Coexistence perspective","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p177tabassam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068991S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361516","isNumber":"6373809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361516","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6373809","articleId":"6373837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6373872,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed E.

A preliminary study has focused on the AF analysis to verify the suitability of a multichannel DVB-T signal for radar applications.

Experimental results in an aerial scenario through the use of SDR hardware have been carried out and showed a clear improvement in range resolution when using multichannel rather than single channel DVB-T signals.

Accordingly, the NILM system can be applied for wide load monitoring and become a powerful energy management and measurement system. Though several NILM algorithms have been developed during the last two decades, the recognition accuracy and computational efficiency remain challenges. To minimize the training time and improve recognition accuracy in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is adopted in this paper to optimize parameters of training algorithm in ANN to improve NILM accuracy. Case studies are verified through the combination of Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) simulations and field measurements. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the recognition accuracy and computational speed under multiple operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2012.6373990","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361088/6373971/06373990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2012.6373990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization based non-intrusive demand monitoring and load identification in smart meters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6373990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization based non-intrusive demand monitoring and load identification in smart meters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13171116","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6373990/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization based non-intrusive demand monitoring and load identification in smart meters","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2012ESC228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081973S","chronDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361088","isNumber":"6373971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361088","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6373971","articleId":"6373990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":6374006,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyao Xu","affiliation":["Kyungsung University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Zhenyao","lastName":"Xu","id":"38236861300"},{"name":"Dong-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Kyungsung University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Hee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37310964300"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Ahn","affiliation":["Kyungsung University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37308875000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0332-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0330-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0331-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"6374006","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374006","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Reluctance motors","Stator windings","Windings","Rotors","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","machine control","reluctance motor drives","stators","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative analysis","bearingless switched reluctance motors","decoupled suspending force control","12-14 hybrid stator pole BLSRM","12-8 double stator BLSRM","torque control","suspending force poles","torque poles","flux distribution","inductance","torque ripple","drive systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bearingless motors","electric machines","electromagnetic analysis","force control","magnetic levitation","torque control","switched reluctance motors"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, two novel bearingless switched reluctance motors (BLSRMs), 12/14 hybrid stator pole BLSRM and 12/8 double stator BLSRM, in which the torque control is naturally decoupled from the suspending force control are proposed.

Motor faults which consist of broken rotor bars, bearing decay, eccentricity, etc. appears as different frequencies in the stator current signals. The winding function is used to obtain stator current and speed signals at different fault and load conditions. These signals are analysed through the adaptive continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to detect the amplitudes and frequency components corresponding to different fault and load conditions. The coefficients of CWT are adapted online based on the harmonics amplitude, which are the output of CWT. These amplitudes and frequencies are applied to train a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in simulation. Then the adaptive CWT and trained FLC are applied to detect the fault condition of a large size motor in both simulation and realtime. The experimental results found that the proposed adaptive CWT and FLC based fault detection method can detect the motor fault conditions accurately. Thus, the proposed method could be a potential candidate to detect the motor fault, especially for large size industrial motors.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2012.6374027","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361088/6373971/06374027.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2012.6374027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On line trained fuzzy logic and adaptive continuous wavelet transform based high precision fault detection of IM with broken rotor bars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374027/","displayDocTitle":"On line trained fuzzy logic and adaptive continuous wavelet transform based high precision fault detection of IM with broken rotor bars","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171153","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374027/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On line trained fuzzy logic and adaptive continuous wavelet transform based high precision fault detection of IM with broken rotor bars","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2012IACC205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112601S","chronDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361088","isNumber":"6373971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361088","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6373971","articleId":"6374027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374030,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An LCL filter can reduce the harmonics introduced by PWM switching frequency and guarantee low currents THD using small component values comparing to the L filter solution. Nevertheless, the additional poles introduced by the LC part induce resonance in the system, leading to stability problems. To deal with this problem, in this contribution, a large signal stabilizing supervisor based on the indirect Lyapunov theory will be designed. The main objective of this stabilizer is to ensure both efficiency and robustness damping proprieties by the using of the Lyapunov method for the generation of power stabilizing signals.

The reactive power capability of the grid-connected hybrid multilevel converter is based on the voltage sensitivity of the distribution grid at PCC. A hybrid five-level multilevel converter referred as flying capacitor (FC) based active-neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter is considered. It is an arrangement of a three-level ANPC converter and a two-level cell. Also, a control strategy is proposed to regulate the FCs voltages of the grid-connected hybrid multilevel converter at their required values. The proposed FC control strategy provides extra freedom to regulate the dc-link capacitor voltages with dc-offset injection technique. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategies for the system considered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Reactive power","Switches","Capacitors","Wind turbines","Wind power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capacitors","power convertors","power grids","reactive power","voltage control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["five-level flying capacitor","active-neutral-point-clamped converter","grid connected wind energy applications","wind energy sources","distribution grid","voltage profile","grid reinforcement","active power injection","voltage regulation","PCC","point of common coupling","reactive power exchange","grid-connected hybrid multilevel converter","voltage sensitivity","hybrid five-level multilevel converter","three-level ANPC converter","two-level cell","FC voltage regulation","dc-link capacitor voltages","FC control strategy","dc-offset injection technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter","permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)","voltage control","distribution systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.2012.6374046","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361088/6373971/06374046.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2012.6374046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of five-level flying capacitor based active-neutral-point-clamped converter for grid connected wind energy applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of five-level flying capacitor based active-neutral-point-clamped converter for grid connected wind energy applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374046/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374046/","accessionNumber":"13171172","conferenceDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of five-level flying capacitor based active-neutral-point-clamped converter for grid connected wind energy applications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2012IACC415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061503S","chronDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361088","isNumber":"6373971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361088","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6373971","articleId":"6374046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6374055,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The model predicts that the current gain is set by the resonant inverter stage while the bandwidth is mainly defined by the output filter and the LED's dynamic resistance, providing the whole system with excellent dynamic behavior. The fast dynamics of the resonant converter ensures an operation free of instabilities and flicker effect with a simple integral controller. A 120W prototype has been built to validate the study.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6373971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2012.6374060","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361088/6373971/06374060.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2012.6374060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"L-C<inf>p</inf> approximation of a phase-controlled LC<inf>s</inf>C<inf>p</inf> resonant converter to study the dynamic response as a LED lamp driver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"L-C<inf>p</inf> approximation of a phase-controlled LC<inf>s</inf>C<inf>p</inf> resonant converter to study the dynamic response as a LED lamp driver","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374060/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171186","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374060/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"L-C<inf>p</inf> approximation of a phase-controlled LC<inf>s</inf>C<inf>p</inf> resonant converter to study the dynamic response as a LED lamp driver","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"2012ILDC268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049304S","chronDate":"7-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361088","isNumber":"6373971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361088","xplore-issue":"6373971","articleId":"6374060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6374144,"authors":[{"name":"Bulent Tastan","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Bulent","lastName":"Tastan","id":"37888600300"},{"name":"Yuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"38527382000"},{"name":"Gita Sukthankar","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Gita","lastName":"Sukthankar","id":"37285072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1194-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1193-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1192-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"6374144","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Learning","Trajectory","Tracking","Entropy","Vectors","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","learning (artificial intelligence)","path planning","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first person shooter games","game bots","adversarial motion planning","opponent interception","couples planning","partially-occluded Unreal Tournament map","inverse reinforcement learning","player-specific motion model","motion models","prediction methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374144","abstract":"One important aspect of creating game bots is adversarial motion planning: identifying how to move to counter possible actions made by the adversary. In this paper, we examine the problem of opponent interception, in which the goal of the bot is to reliably apprehend the opponent. We present an algorithm for motion planning that couples planning and prediction to intercept an enemy on a partially-occluded Unreal Tournament map. Human players can exhibit considerable variability in their movement preferences and do not uniformly prefer the same routes. To model this variability, we use inverse reinforcement learning to learn a player-specific motion model from sets of example traces. Opponent motion prediction is performed using a particle filter to track candidate hypotheses of the opponent's location over multiple time horizons. Our results indicate that the learned motion model has a higher tracking accuracy and yields better interception outcomes than other motion models and prediction methods.","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2012.6374144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2012.6374144","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361518/6374097/06374144.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to intercept opponents in first person shooter games","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Learning to intercept opponents in first person shooter games","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374144/","accessionNumber":"13171932","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374144/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to intercept opponents in first person shooter games","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper1463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081612S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361518","isNumber":"6374097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361518","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6374097","articleId":"6374144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6374146,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Athanasiadis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Athanasiadis","id":"37089143351"},{"name":"Damianos Galanopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Damianos","lastName":"Galanopoulos","id":"38527353700"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tefas","id":"37299690600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1194-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1193-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1192-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"6374146","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Biological neural networks","Games","Acceleration","Gears"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["progressive neural network training","open racing car simulator","car racing controller","bot teachers","steering","rule based decision driver","driving behavior"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374146","abstract":"In this paper a novel methodology for training neural networks as car racing controllers is proposed.

The proposed approach is based on Neural Networks that learn progressively the driving behaviour of other bots. Starting with a simple rule-based decision driver, our scope is to handle its decisions with NN and increase its performance as much as possible. In order to do so, we propose a sequence of Neural networks that are gradually trained from more dexterous drivers, as well as, from the simplest to the most skillful controller. Our method is actually, an effective initialization method for Neural Networks that leads to increasingly better driving behavior. We have tested the method in several tracks of increasing difficulty.

Beam search is a search method that only expands a limited number of promising nodes per tree level, thus restricting the space complexity of the underlying search algorithm to linear in the tree depth. This paper presents Beam Monte-Carlo Tree Search (BMCTS), combining the ideas of MCTS and beam search. Like MCTS, BMCTS builds a search tree using Monte-Carlo simulations as state evaluations. When a predetermined number of simulations has traversed the nodes of a given tree depth, these nodes are sorted by their estimated value, and only a fixed number of them is selected for further exploration. In our experiments with the puzzles SameGame, Clickomania and Bubble Breaker, BMCTS significantly outperforms MCTS at equal time controls. We show that the improvement is equivalent to an up to four-fold increase in computing time for MCTS.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361518/6374097/06374160.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"233","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2012.6374160","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2012.6374160","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Monte Carlo methods","Tiles","Color","Computational modeling","Convergence","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","stochastic processes","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam Monte-Carlo tree search","stochastic search algorithm","multi-player games","one-player games","beam search","BMCTS","Monte-Carlo simulations","SameGame","Clickomania","Bubble Breaker"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374160/","displayDocTitle":"Beam Monte-Carlo Tree Search","accessionNumber":"13171948","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374160/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Monte-Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper3032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148242S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361518","isNumber":"6374097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361518","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6374097","articleId":"6374160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374161,"authors":[{"name":"Edward J.

Our approach is hierarchical, using domain-specific algorithms and heuristics to plan a coarse-grained route and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to plan and steer along fine-grained paths. The MCTS component uses macro-actions to decrease the number of decisions to be made per unit of time and thus drastically reduce the size of the decision tree. Results from the 2012 WCCI PTSP Competition show that this approach significantly and consistently outperforms all other submitted AI controllers, and is competitive with strong human players.

In this paper, we apply MCTS to the game of Tron, a simultaneous real-time two-player game. The fact that players have to react fast and that moves occur simultaneously creates an unusual setting for MCTS, in which classical selection policies such as UCB1 may be suboptimal. In this paper, we perform an empirical comparison of a wide range of selection policies for MCTS applied to Tron, with both deterministic policies (UCB1, UCBl-Tuned, UCB-V, UCB-Minimal, OMC-Deterministic, MOSS) and stochastic policies (\u03f5\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sub>\n-greedy, EXP3, Thompson Sampling, OMC-Stochastic, PBBM). From the experiments, we observe that UCBl-Tuned has the best behavior shortly followed by UCB1. Even if UCB-Minimal is ranked fourth, this is a remarkable result for this recently introduced selection policy found through automatic discovery of good policies on generic multi-armed bandit problems. We also show that deterministic policies perform better than stochastic ones for this problem.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361518/6374097/06374162.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"249","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2012.6374162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2012.6374162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of different selection strategies in Monte-Carlo Tree Search for the game of Tron","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of different selection strategies in Monte-Carlo Tree Search for the game of Tron","htmlLink":"/document/6374162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13171950","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of different selection strategies in Monte-Carlo Tree Search for the game of Tron","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper3288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102396S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361518","isNumber":"6374097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361518","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6374097","articleId":"6374162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6374165,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Pepels","affiliation":["Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht, Limburg, NL"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Pepels","id":"38525772800"},{"name":"Mark H.

MCTS is used to find an optimal path for an agent at each turn, determining the move to make based on randomised simulations. Ms Pac-Man is a real-time arcade game, in which the protagonist has several independent goals but no conclusive terminal state. Unlike games such as Chess or Go there is no state in which the player wins the game. Furthermore, the Pac-Man agent has to compete with a range of different ghost agents, hence limited assumptions can be made about the opponent's behaviour. In order to expand the capabilities of existing MCTS agents, five enhancements are discussed: 1) a variable depth tree, 2) playout strategies for the ghost-team and Pac-Man, 3) including long-term goals in scoring, 4) endgame tactics, and 5) a Last-Good-Reply policy for memorising rewarding moves during playouts. An average performance gain of 40,962 points, compared to the average score of the top scoring Pac-Man agent during the CIG'11, is achieved by employing these methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIG.2012.6374165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374097","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6361518/6374097/06374165.pdf","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancements for Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Ms Pac-Man","doi":"10.1109/CIG.2012.6374165","startPage":"265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements for Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Ms Pac-Man","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374165/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13171953","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374165/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements for Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Ms Pac-Man","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper35106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068942S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6361518","isNumber":"6374097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6361518","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6374097","articleId":"6374165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6374183,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Wender","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wender","id":"37283410500"},{"name":"Ian Watson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Watson","id":"37305430100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1194-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1193-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1192-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-4270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"}],"articleNumber":"6374183","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Learning systems","Learning","Planning","Machine learning","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","software agents","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small scale combat","real-time strategy game StarCraft:Broodwar","reinforcement learning algorithms","micro-managing combat units","RTS game SC:BW","complex environment","unsupervised learning","nonadaptive deterministic game AI","RL algorithms","one-step Q-learning","Sarsa(\u03bb) algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374183","abstract":"This paper presents an evaluation of the suitability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to perform the task of micro-managing combat units in the commercial real-time strategy (RTS) game StarCraft:Broodwar (SC:BW).

Differently from current solutions, no bulky elements are required allowing to maintain the most important features of this technology namely its compactness and ease of manufacturing. In order to quickly analyze and design the transition, both a coupled resonator and a transmission line models are developed, together with design guidelines.

A total of 12 nodes were placed on the body to measure the multi-link channel within the created WBAN. The resulting empirical model takes into account the received power, the link fading statistics, and the link auto- and cross-correlations. The distance dependence of the received power is investigated, and the link fading is modeled by a log-normal distribution. The link autocorrelation function is divided into a decaying component and a sinusoidal component to account for the periodical movement of the limbs caused by walking. The cross-correlation between different links is also shown to be high for a number of specific on-body links. Finally, the model is validated by considering several extraction-independent validation metrics: multi-hop link capacity, level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD). The capacity aims at validating the path-loss and fading model, while the LCR and AFD aim at validating the temporal behavior. For all validation metrics, the model is shown to satisfactorily reproduce the measurements, whereas its limits are pointed out.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2231917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6493420/06374221.pdf","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2208","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2231917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Channel Modeling for Multi-Sensor Body Area Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Channel Modeling for Multi-Sensor Body Area Networks","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6374221/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413045","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Channel Modeling for Multi-Sensor Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"tap-quitin-2231917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130648S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6493420","articleId":"6374221","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6374222,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The utilized sampling criterion depends on the electrical size of the antenna under test (AUT) along with the separation between the AUT and the measurement surface. The minimum number of samples required is directly linked with the number of unknowns in the linear system of equations derived considering spherical expansion of radiated AUT fields. Equivalent plane wave sources are used to represent the AUT fields. Plane wave translations can be directly performed for any arbitrary measurement grid with the same efficiency. Thus, nonredundant sampling representations can be utilized on any scan surface. In contrast, other fast field transformation techniques would lose their efficiency. The proposed sampling is applied to near-field measurements and synthetic data using a variety of antennas and the results are compared to the case of standard sampling.

A simplified method of designing the feedback gain matrix of the sliding-mode observer is introduced for easy application. The PLL coefficients are analyzed by considering the expected position estimation error and the operating condition. Compared with the conventional arc-tangent calculation method, the proposed quadrature PLL estimation method can be immune to the influence of the noise and distortion. To achieve the robust high-efficiency operation of the sensorless IPMSM, an enhanced online maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control strategy without motor parameters dependent is adopted for the vector control drive. The optimal MTPA operation is achieved by searching the optimal current angle online to make the current amplitude be the minimum. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with a 2.2-kW IPMSM sensorless drive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374241/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13287424","volume":"28","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature PLL-Based High-Order Sliding-Mode Observer for IPMSM Sensorless Control With Online MTPA Control Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature PLL-Based High-Order Sliding-Mode Observer for IPMSM Sensorless Control With Online MTPA Control Strategy","sourcePdf":"tec-wang-2228484-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085407S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6457464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6457464","articleId":"6374241","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374242,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Breglio","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giovanni Breglio received the B.S. degree (cum laude) in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.","He is a Professor with the University of Naples Federico II."]},"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Breglio","id":"37321127000"},{"name":"Andrea Irace","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Andrea Irace (SM\u201911) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering in 1994 and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor of electronics with the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy."]},"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Irace","id":"37322354300"},{"name":"Ettore Napoli","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Ettore Napoli received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering.","Since 2005, he has been with the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, where he is currently an Associate Professor."]},"firstName":"Ettore","lastName":"Napoli","id":"37268558100"},{"name":"Michele Riccio","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Michele Riccio received the B.S.

Following this promising avenue of research, we propose a novel biobjective formulation of the multimodal optimization problem and use differential evolution (DE) with nondominated sorting followed by hypervolume measure-based sorting to finally detect a set of solutions corresponding to multiple global and local optima of the function under test. Unlike the two earlier multiobjective approaches (biobjective multipopulation genetic algorithm and niching-based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II), the proposed multimodal optimization with biobjective DE (MOBiDE) algorithm does not require the actual or estimated gradient of the multimodal function to form its second objective. Performance of MOBiDE is compared with eight state-of-the-art single-objective niching algorithms and two recently developed biobjective niching algorithms using a test suite of 14 basic and 15 composite multimodal problems. Experimental results supported by nonparametric statistical tests suggest that MOBiDE is able to provide better and more consistent performance over the existing well-known multimodal algorithms for majority of the test problems without incurring any serious computational burden.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2012.2231685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6613564/06374243.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2012.2231685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6613564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Biobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm Enhanced With Mean Distance-Based Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374243/","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Biobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm Enhanced With Mean Distance-Based Selection","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796225","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374243/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Optimization Using a Biobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm Enhanced With Mean Distance-Based Selection","sourcePdf":"tevc-das-2231685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168282S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6613564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6613564","articleId":"6374243","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6374246,"authors":[{"name":"Fayez F.

Based on the principle of optimal control, a position tracking controller is designed to minimize a quadratic performance index. In addition, a RWENN controller with accurate approximation capability is used to approximate a nonlinear function in the optimal control law. Moreover, a robust controller with adaptive bound estimation algorithm is proposed to confront the approximation error. The online adaptive control laws are derived based on the optimal control technique and Lyapunov stability analysis, so that the stability of the IORWENNCS can be guaranteed. Using the proposed control scheme, the position tracking performance is substantially improved and the robustness to uncertainties can be obtained as well. All control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C31 DSP-based control computer. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed IORWENNCS grants robust performance and precise tracking response regardless of load disturbances and PMSM

This paper proposes the construction and the processing of a new region-based hierarchical hyperspectral image representation relying on the binary partition tree (BPT). This hierarchical region-based representation can be interpreted as a set of hierarchical regions stored in a tree structure. Hence, the BPT succeeds in presenting: 1) the decomposition of the image in terms of coherent regions, and 2) the inclusion relations of the regions in the scene. Based on region-merging techniques, the BPT construction is investigated by studying the hyperspectral region models and the associated similarity metrics. Once the BPT is constructed, the fixed tree structure allows implementing efficient and advanced application-dependent techniques on it. The application-dependent processing of BPT is generally implemented through a specific pruning of the tree. In this paper, a pruning strategy is proposed and discussed in a classification context. Experimental results on various hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the interest and the good performances of the BPT representation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Representation and Processing With Binary Partition Trees","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2231687","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6449327/06374252.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2231687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Representation and Processing With Binary Partition Trees","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6374252/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13284889","pubMedId":"23221824","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Representation and Processing With Binary Partition Trees","sourcePdf":"tip-valero-2231687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.352992S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6449327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6449327","articleId":"6374252","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374258,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Chang","affiliation":["Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37293109500"},{"name":"Ju Han","affiliation":["Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Han","id":"37290382000"},{"name":"Alexander Borowsky","affiliation":["Center for Comparative Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Borowsky","id":"38264348100"},{"name":"Leandro Loss","affiliation":["Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Loss","id":"37860134100"},{"name":"Joe W.

Our objective is to characterize tumor histopathology, through the delineation of the nuclear regions, from hematoxylin and eosin \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(H&amp;E</i>\n) stained tissue sections. Such a representation can then be mined for intrinsic subtypes across a large dataset for prediction and molecular association. Furthermore, nuclear segmentation is formulated within a multi-reference graph framework with geodesic constraints, which enables computation of multidimensional representations, on a cell-by-cell basis, for functional enrichment and bioinformatics analysis. Here, we present a novel method, multi-reference graph cut (MRGC), for nuclear segmentation that overcomes technical variations associated with sample preparation by incorporating prior knowledge from manually annotated reference images and local image features. The proposed approach has been validated on manually annotated samples and then applied to a dataset of 377 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) whole slide images from 146 patients. For the GBM cohort, multidimensional representation of the nuclear features and their organization have identified 1) statistically significant subtypes based on several morphometric indexes, 2) whether each subtype can be predictive or not, and 3) that the molecular correlates of predictive subtypes are consistent with the literature. Data and intermediaries for a number of tumor types (GBM, low grade glial, and kidney renal clear carcinoma) are available at: http://tcga.lbl.gov for correlation with TCGA molecular data. The website also provides an interface for panning and zooming of whole mount tissue sections with/without overlaid segmentation results for quality control.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2012.2231420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6490389/06374258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2231420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6490389","startPage":"670","endPage":"682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invariant Delineation of Nuclear Architecture in Glioblastoma Multiforme for Clinical and Molecular Association","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Invariant Delineation of Nuclear Architecture in Glioblastoma Multiforme for Clinical and Molecular Association","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13412698","pubMedId":"23221815","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374258/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Invariant Delineation of Nuclear Architecture in Glioblastoma Multiforme for Clinical and Molecular Association","sourcePdf":"tmi-parvin-2231420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157214S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6490389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6490389","articleId":"6374258","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374263,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Mastronarde","affiliation":["University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6412815/6374263/6374263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicholas Mastronarde (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.S. and M.

The objective of the MDP is to minimize long-term power consumption subject to a minimum Quality of Service (QoS) constraint related to the decoder's throughput.

One major bottleneck of NB-LDPC decoding is the complicated check node processing. In this paper, a novel relaxed check node processing scheme is proposed for the min-max NB-LDPC decoding algorithm. Each finite field element of GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n) can be uniquely represented by a linear combination of p independent field elements. Making use of this property, an innovative method is developed in this paper to first find a set of the p most reliable variable-to-check messages with independent field elements, called the minimum basis. Then, the check-to-variable messages are efficiently computed from the minimum basis.

Cognitive radios have been proposed to enable unlicensed (or secondary) users to borrow locally idle bands of the spectrum provided that no significant interference is created for the licensed (or primary) users. Fast adaptation to the changing spectrum availability is naturally a major requirement in such systems. This adaptation consists of detecting the spectrum occupied by the primary users, computing a new resource allocation for the secondary network, and communicating this allocation through the network. In that context, we develop a resource allocation scheme for multi-input-multi-output wireless mesh networks. The proposed algorithm combines low computational complexity and light control traffic thanks to a combination of relevant approximations in the general nonpolynomial-hard allocation problem. The allocation consists of two steps. First, a centralized carrier allocation is performed at a coordinator node based on partial knowledge of the network parameters. Then, each node locally computes its power allocation through simple water-filling algorithms. Numerical results show that compared to state-of-the-art techniques, 10% of the total throughput of the network is sacrificed to reduce the computation time and the control traffic by two orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2231708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06374267.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2231708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for MIMO Cognitive Networks With Low Control Traffic and Low Computational Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374267/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for MIMO Cognitive Networks With Low Control Traffic and Low Computational Complexity","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487032","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374267/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for MIMO Cognitive Networks With Low Control Traffic and Low Computational Complexity","sourcePdf":"tvt-lessinnes-2231708-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078945S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6374267","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6374269,"authors":[{"name":"Noah Sturcken","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6399535/6374269/6374269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noah Sturcken (S'08) received the B.S. degree summa cum laude in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2009.

Digital VLSI architectures employing parallel channels are proposed, physically realized and tested. The multi-encoded AI framework allows a multiplication-free and computationally accurate architecture. It also guarantees a noise-free computation throughput the multi-level multi-rate 2-D filtering operation. A single final reconstruction step (FRS) furnishes filtered and down-sampled image outputs in fixed-point, resulting in low levels of quantization noise. Comparisons are provided between Daubechies-4 and -6 designs in terms of SNR, PSNR, hardware structure, and power consumptions, for different word lengths. SNR and PSNR improvements of approximately 30% were observed in favour of AI-based systems, when compared to 8-bit fixed-point schemes (six fractional bits). Further, FRS designs based on canonical signed digit representation and on expansion factors are proposed. The Daubechies-4 and -6 4-level VLSI architectures are prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 FPGA device at 282 MHz and 146 MHz, respectively, with dynamic power consumption of 164 mW and 339 mW, respectively, and verified on FPGA chip using an ML605 platform.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6519344/06374275.pdf","startPage":"1455","endPage":"1468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6519344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Architectures for the 4-Tap and 6-Tap 2-D Daubechies Wavelet Filters Using Algebraic Integers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374275/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Architectures for the 4-Tap and 6-Tap 2-D Daubechies Wavelet Filters Using Algebraic Integers","volume":"60","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374275/","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13529199","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Architectures for the 4-Tap and 6-Tap 2-D Daubechies Wavelet Filters Using Algebraic Integers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-madanayake-2221171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143634S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6519344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6519344","articleId":"6374275","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374278,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaud L.

This limitation is overcome in this work with a highly integrated antenna module that combines both broadside and end-fire radiators in a single multilayer organic package. Liquid crystal polymer and Rogers RO3003 are used to implement a small form factor (12.5 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 1.3 mm) antenna architecture. The co-designed broadside and end-fire antennas are characterized and measured for operation in the 57-66-GHz frequency range. Measured boresight gains of 8.7 and 10.9 dBi are achieved for the broadside and end-fire antennas while maintaining 35-45-dB isolation between both antennas. The numerically estimated radiation efficiency is found to be 92.5% and 78.5% for the broadside and end-fire elements. These antennas are orthogonally polarized and suitable for frequency reuse. Integrated circuits are mounted inside recessed cavities to realize a fully active antenna module with beam switching or simultaneous radiation.

It is capable of splitting power and selecting frequency at the same time. The phase shift of the filter is found to be \u00b190\u00b0 at the center frequency. Therefore, when it is matched to 70.7 \u03a9, it can replace the conventional quarter-wave length transmission line in the power divider. The isolation elements are loaded at the filters' open ends to get a good isolation between the output ports. As a result, both the transmission and isolation property are satisfied. The equivalent even- and odd-mode circuits of the proposed structure are analyzed and design equations are derived. They are used to guide the design of the devices. For demonstration, filter-integrated power dividers with single- and dual-band operation are implemented, respectively. Comparisons of the measured and simulated results are presented to verify the theoretical predications.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2226600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6414699/06374281.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2226600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single- and Dual-Band Power Dividers Integrated With Bandpass Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374281/","displayDocTitle":"Single- and Dual-Band Power Dividers Integrated With Bandpass Filters","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13244777","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374281/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single- and Dual-Band Power Dividers Integrated With Bandpass Filters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-li-2226600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068039S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6414699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6414699","articleId":"6374281","onlineDate":"04 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6374294,"authors":[{"name":"Pratip Chakraborty","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Pratip","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"38526922200"},{"name":"Abhijit Ambekar","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Ambekar","id":"37982556000"},{"name":"Hans D.

In this paper, a study on the asymptotic performance of spatially-coupled ensembles over the binary erasure channel (BEC) with density evolution analysis based on the belief-propagation algorithm is conducted. We identify all possible members of base matrices with minimal coupling (corresponding to a code memory of one and two) for asymptotically (3; 6)-regular spatially-coupled codes. For ensembles with single memory, block decoding and window decoding thresholds are calculated and for ensembles with memory of two, window decoding thresholds are calculated. It is shown that not only block decoding thresholds of finite-length spatially-coupled ensembles over BEC is better than LDPC block codes, but also are their window decoding thresholds. Based on the results, spatially-coupled code ensembles with the best performance are identified and some practical code design criteria are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374296","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374296.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the asymptotic performance of spatially-coupled codes with minimal coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the asymptotic performance of spatially-coupled codes with minimal coupling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172071","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374296/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the asymptotic performance of spatially-coupled codes with minimal coupling","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"AsymptoticPerformanceofSpatiallyCoupledCodesAshraf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063984S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374297,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00fas Guti\u00e9rrez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Guti\u00e9rrez","id":"37347616800"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","id":"37285060300"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37274274400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4455-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4454-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4453-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0827"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-0819"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-0819"}],"articleNumber":"6374297","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Rician channels","Emulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming-based emulation","spatial correlated MISO channels","temporal correlated MISO channels","mobile wireless channel characteristics","multiple-input multiple-output systems performance","MIMO systems performance","wireless channels","intrinsically quasistatic","multiple-input single-output channel emulation","spatial correlation characteristics","temporal correlation characteristics","time-varying beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Temporal and spatial correlation are inherent mobile wireless channel characteristics that determine multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems performance.

Severe oscillator PN gives rise to inter-carrier interference that becomes a limiting factor in sustaining reliable communication link. Considering a received signal perturbed by PN, we derive an iterative Bayesian algorithm based on the statistical modeling of the PN process. This approach however needs computationally intensive inversion of large data-dependent matrices. Taking advantage of the approximate sparsity pattern inherent to the PN spectral composition and exploiting decoupled compensators, the proposed scheme enhances the receiver performance while retaining a modest complexity. Furthermore, we consider how these estimators perform in the case of multiple-antenna RX front-ends with a generalized oscillator signal distribution to the radio paths and numerically evaluate the performance achieved by the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374308","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374308.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the efficient mitigation of phase noise in MIMO-OFDM receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the efficient mitigation of phase noise in MIMO-OFDM receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374308/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172083","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the efficient mitigation of phase noise in MIMO-OFDM receivers","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"EfficientMitigationofPhaseNoiseIshaque2551277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052924S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374311,"authors":[{"name":"J.

One key element of this technology is spectrum sensing, which allows secondary users to detect the presence of licensed (primary) users. To this end, multiantenna spectrum sensing techniques have been proposed to detect the presence of a primary user based solely on the correlation structure of the signal received by a cognitive secondary receiver equipped with multiple antennas. Despite the numerous theoretical studies in the area of spectrum sensing, there exists a lack of experimental work evaluating the performance of these techniques in practice. In this paper, we test the performance of multiantenna Bayesian and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detectors on a cognitive radio platform. In comparison to one-shot GLRT detectors, the Bayesian detector is able to exploit past information from previous sensing periods, thus learning from the environment and improving its performance. Our cognitive platform is composed of Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) nodes, that emulate the behavior of a single-antenna primary and a multiantenna cognitive receiver. Our measurements show that the Bayesian detector outperforms the GLRT detectors, in both stationary and nonstationary environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of multiantenna spectrum sensing detectors using a cognitive radio testbed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374311/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of multiantenna spectrum sensing detectors using a cognitive radio testbed","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172086","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of multiantenna spectrum sensing detectors using a cognitive radio testbed","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"ExperimentalEvaluationofMultiAntennaSpectrumMancoV.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064074S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374318,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Ambekar","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Ambekar","id":"37982556000"},{"name":"Mohamed Hassan","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hassan","id":"38527617300"},{"name":"Hans D.

The desired low-cost, low-power and fully integrated implementation of MIMO OFDM systems leads to the application of direct (up/down) conversion architecture, whose performance can be seriously limited by I/Q-imbalance. Thus, the compensation of I/Q-imbalance is a crucial issue in the implementation of MIMO OFDM systems, which requires reliable parameter estimation. In this paper, an efficient scheme is proposed for the joint estimation of the MIMO channel and frequency-selective I/Q-imbalance both at the transmitter and the receiver. First, a multi-functional preamble is presented, which not only fulfills the optimal design rules for joint estimation but can also be used for both parameter estimation and frame detection/time synchronization, allowing low overhead. Furthermore, low Crest-Factor (CF) of the preamble is achieved. Based on this preamble, a low complexity estimator is developed, which can achieve performance close to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Numerical simulation results and complexity analysis have verified the advantages of the proposed estimation scheme over the existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374322","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374322.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint MIMO channel- and frequency-selective I/Q-imbalance estimation using a multi-functional preamble for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374322/","displayDocTitle":"Joint MIMO channel- and frequency-selective I/Q-imbalance estimation using a multi-functional preamble for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172095","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374322/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint MIMO channel- and frequency-selective I/Q-imbalance estimation using a multi-functional preamble for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"JointMIMOLuo2537203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080615S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6374326,"authors":[{"name":"Anggia Anggraini","affiliation":["Institut of Communications Engineering, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Anggia","lastName":"Anggraini","id":"37857903400"},{"name":"Thi Chung Le","affiliation":["Institut of Communications Engineering, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thi Chung","lastName":"Le","id":"38254742200"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institut of Communications Engineering, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Department of Digital Signal Processing, Faculty of Engineering, Duisburg Essen University, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4455-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4454-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4453-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0827"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-0819"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-0819"}],"articleNumber":"6374326","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","MIMO","Mobile communication","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","linear codes","MIMO communication","mobile radio","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multiuser relay system","BER performance analysis","base station","mobile station","transmission","cell edge","neighbouring cells","linear precoding technique","block diagonalization","interference alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay","MIMO","Multi-user","Block Diagonalization","Interference Alignment","Amplify-and-Forward (AF)","Decode-and-Forward (DF)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the BER performance analysis of a MIMO multi-user relay network.

This paper presents a decoding technique that combines a serial and a parallel implementation to achieve a better trade-off between throughput and space complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374329.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed serial/parallel hardware implementation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for BCH decoding in Flash controller applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Decoding","Polynomials","Error correction codes","Throughput","Error correction","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","BCH codes","circuit complexity","decoding","error correction","flash memories","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed serial-parallel hardware implementation","Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","BCH decoding","flash controller","error correction","flash memories","BCH codes","algebraic decoding","Galois field multiplications","space complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Mixed serial/parallel hardware implementation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for BCH decoding in Flash controller applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374329/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172102","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed serial/parallel hardware implementation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for BCH decoding in Flash controller applications","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"MixedserialHWImplementationFreudenberger2538917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044797S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6374331,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Signal Processing (DSV), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38523389500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4455-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4454-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4453-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0827"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-0819"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-0819"}],"articleNumber":"6374331","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Peak to average power ratio","Nonlinear distortion","Prototypes","Data communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","telecommunication services","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier transmission schemes","cognitive radio","radio services","spectrum scarcity problem","licensed spectra","secondary users","spectral holes","spatial domains","frequency domains","temporal domains","adjacent-channel interference avoidance","ACI avoidance","secondary user out-of-band radiation","secondary user OOB radiation","FCC","adjacent-channel leakage power ratio","ACLR","television white space","TVWS"]}],"abstract":"With the proliferation of radio services in the past decades, most of the spectrum available below 2GHz has been allocated, resulting in the spectrum scarcity problem.

The main drawback of OFDM is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which PAPR necessitates a highly linear high power amplifier (HPA) in Class-A mode to avoid out-of-band radiation. This kind of amplifiers usually suffers from a bad power efficiency. A recent approach is to deploy different amplifier architectures with potentially higher power efficiencies, such as polar amplifiers. These kinds of amplifiers necessitate signals with low peak-to-minimum power ratio (PMR). In this paper, the PMR of the continuous time transmit signal is analyzed and reduced via Selected Mapping (SLM). To achieve this reduction in the domain of digital signal processing an approximation method for the PMR is derived.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374335","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374335.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PMR-reduction for continuous time OFDM transmit signals by selected mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374335/","displayDocTitle":"PMR-reduction for continuous time OFDM transmit signals by selected mapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374335/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PMR-reduction for continuous time OFDM transmit signals by selected mapping","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"PMRReductionRettelbach2551945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097598S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374342,"authors":[{"name":"Reza A.

However, due to the nature of the sliding window decoding architecture that is used to decode these codes, the associated error performance is considerably degraded over channels with memory, such as the burst erasure channel. In this case, using a block interleaver to break up the effects of the channel memory is not a viable option, since a block interleaver introduces a large amount of delay to the communication system and therefore takes back many of the advantages of using a sliding window decoder. In this paper, a reduced-delay communication system employing a convolutional interleaver is proposed. This scheme benefits from the inherent convolutional nature of the spatially-coupled codes and matches their structure with a low-delay convolutional interleaver. Thus, the resulting communication system exhibits very low overall delay. The performance of the proposed communication system is analyzed using the density evolution technique. Specifically, single-memory (minimum decoding delay), asymptotically (3,6)-regular spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles are considered in the presence of burst erasures and the performance improvement of using a convolutional interleaver is demonstrated as a function of added interleaving delay in terms of iterative decoding thresholds.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374342","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374342.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spatially-coupled communication system for the correlated erasure channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A spatially-coupled communication system for the correlated erasure channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172115","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374342/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374342/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spatially-coupled communication system for the correlated erasure channel","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"SpatiallyCoupledCommunicationSystemAshrafi2549585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046445S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374343,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Its quadrature outputs are processed in a commercially available baseband processor that combines dual channel 14-bit, 250 MS/s analog to digital converters (ADC) with a Virtex 6 FPGA. The design and implementation status of the system will be described, as well as its validation under realistic noise and interference conditions, sensing white spaces in the UHF TV band.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSE.2012.6374345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374285","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on Signals, Systems, and Electronics (ISSSE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362332/6374285/06374345.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a highly flexible spectrum sensing platform for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374345/","displayDocTitle":"Towards a highly flexible spectrum sensing platform for cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172118","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a highly flexible spectrum sensing platform for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Potsdam, Germany","sourcePdf":"TowardsaHighlyFlexibleSpectrumSensingLohmiller2538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069211S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362332","isNumber":"6374285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362332","xplore-issue":"6374285","articleId":"6374345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6374346,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Raimundo","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Raimundo","id":"38526097200"},{"name":"Sana Salous","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK"],"firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Salous","id":"37264919900"},{"name":"Karim Nasr","affiliation":["National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Nasr","id":"37284181400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4455-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4454-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4453-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0827"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-0819"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2161-0819"}],"articleNumber":"6374346","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Reverberation chamber","MIMO","Diversity methods","Diversity reception","Frequency measurement","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","indoor radio","microwave antenna arrays","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","reverberation chambers","Rician channels","UHF antennas","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB MIMO measurements","reverberation chamber","indoor environment","UWB antenna arrays","discone antennas","diversity gain","MIMO capacity","line-of-sight indoor measurements","LOS indoor measurements","nonLOS indoor measurements","reverberation measurements","Rayleigh distribution","Rician distribution","frequency 2 GHz to 6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity Gain","UWB antennas","Reverberation Chamber","Indoor propagation measurements","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents reference measurements of 2 \u00d7 2 UWB antenna arrays consisting of discone antennas with a frequency range from 2 - 6 GHz performed in a reverberation chamber.

Impedance matching is implemented so that the transfer system is resilient to positional changed and load changed. Recently powering multiple loads simultaneously is becoming the focus in wireless power transfer researches and designs. Apart from maintaining high efficiency, controllable power division is also an important feature in multi-receiver system. This is due to ratio of power division depends not only on the load but also on the gap of each receiver to the transmitter. On the other hand, cross coupling exists when receivers are placed relatively near to each other. In this paper, novel algorithm is proposed for impedance matching and power division considering cross coupling in between two receivers. The wireless power transfer system is first represented by equivalent circuit and the algorithm for impedance matching and power division is derived. The new method is then verified using simulations.","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374468","publicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362321/6374450/06374468.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374450","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance matching and power division algorithm considering cross coupling for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impedance matching and power division algorithm considering cross coupling for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374468/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171984","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374468/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impedance matching and power division algorithm considering cross coupling for wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2012000058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07229S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362321","isNumber":"6374450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362321","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6374450","articleId":"6374468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6374469,"authors":[{"name":"Maurizio Salato","affiliation":["VICOR, Andover, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Salato","id":"38511475500"},{"name":"Adnan Zolj","affiliation":["VICOR, Andover, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Zolj","id":"38528536600"},{"name":"Dustin J.

While higher DC voltage can efficiently address the power system's total cost of ownership, system integrators need to interface existing 48V equipment in a simple and effective way. Similarly, equipment manufacturers need to design and make available new hardware that can directly accept the higher DC voltage. This paper presents power system architectures that address both needs, analyzing trade-offs at component as well as system partitioning level.

In this paper, reliability and availability of AC UPS topologies are compared to 380V DC topologies using an example of powering a 270kW load. The comparison is made for several different topologies and includes datacenter electrical infrastructure allocated to AC UPS and DC UPS systems. Results of this comparison are derived from a static reliability modeling approach by means of Fault Tree Analysis.","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374509","publicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362321/6374450/06374509.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telecom datacenter power infrastructure availability comparison of DC and AC UPS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","displayDocTitle":"Telecom datacenter power infrastructure availability comparison of DC and AC UPS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172024","htmlLink":"/document/6374509/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telecom datacenter power infrastructure availability comparison of DC and AC UPS","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"INTELEC2012000167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074616S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362321","isNumber":"6374450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362321","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6374450","articleId":"6374509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374516,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38260924600"},{"name":"Ke Dai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Dai","id":"37285959900"},{"name":"Kewei Duan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kewei","lastName":"Duan","id":"38267003100"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38527222400"},{"name":"Yong Kang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Kang","id":"37277019000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1000-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0999-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0998-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"6374516","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Active filters","Power filters","Damping","Harmonic analysis","Switching frequency","Resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","compensation","harmonic analysis","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LLCL filter topology","three-phase three-wire shunt active power filter","high-order output filter","SAPF","capacitor","switching frequency harmonic attenuation","harmonic compensation","nonlinear load","system stability problems","passive damping method","damping resistor","power loss minimization criteria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active power filter","harmonic attenuation","LLCL filter","passive damping","series resonant circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an LLCL filter on three-phase three-wire shunt active power filter","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374516","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"Intelec 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362321/6374450/06374516.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.2012.6374516","abstract":"This paper concentrates on a new high-order output filter, named LLCL filter, and its application issues on the three-phase three-wire shunt active power filter (SAPF). The LLCL topology is constructed by replacing the capacitor of the traditional LCL filter with an LC branch that resonant at the switching frequency. The SAPF with an LLCL filter exhibits excellent switching frequency harmonic attenuation capability, which is beneficial to the harmonic compensation for nonlinear load. System stability problems aroused by resonance are investigated, and a passive damping method by adding a real resistor in the LC branch is adopted for simplicity. The selection of the damping resistor is based on the criteria of minimization of power loss as well as maintaining good harmonic compensation performance.

data captured by existing standoff biometric systems typically has lower biometric recognition performance than their close range counterparts due to imaging challenges, pose challenges, and other

To assist in overcoming these limitations systems typically perform in a multi-modal capacity such as Honeywell's Combined Face and Iris (CFAIRS) [21] system. While this improves the systems performance, standoff systems have yet to be proven as accurate as their close range equivalents. We will present a standoff system capable of operating up to 7 meters in range. Unlike many systems such as the CFAIRS our system captures high quality 12 MP video allowing for a multi-sample as well as multimodal comparison. We found that for standoff systems multi-sample improved performance more than multimodal. For a small test group of 50 subjects we were able to achieve 100% rank one recognition performance with our system on standoff recognition of noncooperative subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374567/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192781","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A multi-sample standoff multimodal biometric system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-sample standoff multimodal biometric system","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059608S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362322","isNumber":"6374538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362322","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6374538","articleId":"6374567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6374584,"authors":[{"name":"Naman Kohli","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, NewDelhi, India"],"firstName":"Naman","lastName":"Kohli","id":"38528500400"},{"name":"Richa Singh","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, NewDelhi, India"],"firstName":"Richa","lastName":"Singh","id":"37329725500"},{"name":"Mayank Vatsa","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Information Technology, NewDelhi, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Vatsa","id":"37418882300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1384-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1383-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6374584","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Accuracy","Vectors","Kernel","Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image representation","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-similarity Weber face image representation","context information","face recognition","automatic detection","kinship classification algorithm","Weber face image preprocessing","kinship database","celebrities images","kinship groups","ethnicity groups","classification accuracy"]}],"abstract":"Establishing kinship using images can be utilized as context information in different applications including face recognition.

As such, they have been used as crucial evidence for identifying and convicting criminals by law enforcement agencies. However, compared to plain and rolled prints, latent fingerprints usually have poor quality of ridge impressions with small fingerprint area, and contain large overlap between the foreground area (friction ridge pattern) and structured or random noise in the background. Accordingly, latent fingerprint segmentation is a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a latent fingerprint segmentation algorithm whose goal is to separate the fingerprint region (region of interest) from background. Our algorithm utilizes both ridge orientation and frequency features. The orientation tensor is used to obtain the symmetric patterns of fingerprint ridge orientation, and local Fourier analysis method is used to estimate the local ridge frequency of the latent fingerprint. Candidate fingerprint (foreground) regions are obtained for each feature type; an intersection of regions from orientation and frequency features localizes the true latent fingerprint regions. To verify the viability of the proposed segmentation algorithm, we evaluated the segmentation results in two aspects: a comparison with the ground truth foreground and matching performance based on segmented region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374593/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192806","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic segmentation of latent fingerprints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic segmentation of latent fingerprints","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081519S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362322","isNumber":"6374538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362322","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6374538","articleId":"6374593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6374599,"authors":[{"name":"Sunpreet S.

These cameras differ in manufacturing technology, including image acquisition spectrum and illumination settings. For large scale applications (e.g. UID system in India) where cameras from several vendors are likely to be used for iris enrollment and authentication, iris camera interoperability is an important consideration. The question we address here is: will the matching accuracy differ in matching iris images captured by two different cameras compared to images captured by the same camera? We propose an iris camera classification-based preprocessing framework to address iris interoperability. The camera classification output is used to perform selective iris image enhancement. Experimental results on the IIITD Multi-Sensor Iris database collected locally and the Notre Dame Cross Sensor database show a significant improvement in the cross-camera iris recognition accuracy using the proposed approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374538","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362322/6374538/06374599.pdf","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On iris camera interoperability","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374599","startPage":"346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"On iris camera interoperability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374599/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13192812","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374599/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On iris camera interoperability","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058494S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362322","isNumber":"6374538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362322","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6374538","articleId":"6374599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":6374605,"authors":[{"name":"Antitza Dantcheva","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Antitza","lastName":"Dantcheva","id":"37595951400"},{"name":"Cunjian Chen","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Cunjian","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240666200"},{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ross","id":"37271231600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1384-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1383-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6374605","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1063},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Face","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Lighting","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cosmetics","face recognition","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial cosmetics","matching accuracy","face recognition systems","automated face recognition","security applications","face altering technique","biometric literature","nonpermanent facial makeup","face images","biometric system"]}],"abstract":"The matching performance of automated face recognition has significantly improved over the past decade.

In this work, we study the impact of a commonly used face altering technique that has received limited attention in the biometric literature, viz., non-permanent facial makeup. Towards understanding its impact, we first assemble two databases containing face images of subjects, before and after applying makeup. We present experimental results on both databases that reveal the effect of makeup on automated face recognition and suggest that this simple alteration can indeed compromise the accuracy of a biometric system. While these are early results, our findings clearly indicate the need for a better understanding of this face altering scheme and the importance of designing algorithms that can successfully overcome the obstacle imposed by the application of facial makeup.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374605","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362322/6374538/06374605.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can facial cosmetics affect the matching accuracy of face recognition systems?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374605/","displayDocTitle":"Can facial cosmetics affect the matching accuracy of face recognition systems?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192818","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374605/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can facial cosmetics affect the matching accuracy of face recognition systems?","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088377S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362322","isNumber":"6374538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362322","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6374538","articleId":"6374605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374607,"authors":[{"name":"Raghavender Jillela","affiliation":["West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Raghavender","lastName":"Jillela","id":"37599155100"},{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ross","id":"37271231600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1385-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1384-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1383-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6374607","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Face","Face recognition","Databases","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Biometrics (access control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","image fusion","image matching","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plastic surgery effects mitigating","face biometrics","ocular biometrics","face image matching","learning based method","fusion approach","information combination","face region","ocular region","recognition performance enhancement","identification mode","plastic surgery database","matching accuracy"]}],"abstract":"The task of successfully matching face images obtained before and after plastic surgery is a challenging problem. The degree to which a face is altered depends on the type and number of plastic surgeries performed, and it is difficult to model such variations. Existing approaches use learning based methods that are either computationally expensive or rely on a set of training images. In this work, a fusion approach is proposed that combines information from the face and ocular regions to enhance recognition performance in the identification mode. The proposed approach provides the highest reported recognition performance on a publicly accessible plastic surgery database, with a rank-one accuracy of 87.4%. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed approach is not learning based and reduces computational requirements. Furthermore, a systematic study of the matching accuracies corresponding to various types of surgeries is presented.","doi":"10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374607","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362322/6374538/06374607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2012.6374607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374538","startPage":"402","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating effects of plastic surgery: Fusing face and ocular biometrics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating effects of plastic surgery: Fusing face and ocular biometrics","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374607/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192820","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374607/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating effects of plastic surgery: Fusing face and ocular biometrics","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059159S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362322","isNumber":"6374538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362322","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6374538","articleId":"6374607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374611,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos Valadimas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Valadimas","id":"37545646000"},{"name":"Andreas Floros","affiliation":["Telecommunications Organization of Greece, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Floros","id":"37691854300"},{"name":"Yiorgos Tsiatouhas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Tsiatouhas","id":"37272806000"},{"name":"Angela Arapoyanni","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Arapoyanni","id":"37272803100"},{"name":"Xrysovalantis Kavousianos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Xrysovalantis","lastName":"Kavousianos","id":"37273655300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6374611","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"44KB","file":"/ielx5/12/6810193/6374611/graphical_abstract/tc-gagraphic-289.jpg","coverImage":""},"abstract":"Timing error tolerance is of great importance in nanometer technology integrated circuits.

By utilizing a new scan Flip-Flop, the Time Dilation technique is capable to detect and correct multiple errors at the minimum penalty of one clock cycle delay. The silicon area overhead and the power consumption are substantially reduced, as compared to the Razor design approach, since no additional memory elements are required. At the same time, the proposed technique introduces only negligible performance degradation since no extra circuitry is inserted in the critical paths of a design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6810193/06374611.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Time Dilation Technique for Timing Error Tolerance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flip-flops","Timing","Clocks","Logic gates","Registers","Latches","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","error detection","flip-flops","integrated circuit design","logic design","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time dilation technique","timing error tolerance","nanometer technology integrated circuits","time dilation design technique","concurrent error detection","off-line manufacturing scan testing","flip-flop","error correction","one-clock cycle delay","silicon area overhead","power consumption","Razor design approach","design path"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["On-line testing","concurrent testing","timing errors","error detection","error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"The Time Dilation Technique for Timing Error Tolerance","volume":"63","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14281619","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Time Dilation Technique for Timing Error Tolerance","sourcePdf":"tc-tsiatouhas-289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12382S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6810193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6374611","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6374615,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599942200"},{"name":"Yuqing Zhang","affiliation":["National Computer Network Intrusion Protection Center, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599089800"},{"name":"Boyang Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38467597000"},{"name":"Jingbo Yan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jingbo","lastName":"Yan","id":"38666895100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"6374615","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":136,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5210},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Servers","Access control","Companies","Cloud computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","digital signatures","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mona","multiowner data sharing security","dynamic groups","cloud computing","group resource sharing","data preservation","identity privacy","untrusted cloud","group signature","dynamic broadcast encryption techniques","storage overhead","encryption computation cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","data sharing","privacy-preserving","access control","dynamic groups"]}],"abstract":"With the character of low maintenance, cloud computing provides an economical and efficient solution for sharing group resource among cloud users.

In this paper, we propose a secure multi-owner data sharing scheme, named Mona, for dynamic groups in the cloud. By leveraging group signature and dynamic broadcast encryption techniques, any cloud user can anonymously share data with others. Meanwhile, the storage overhead and encryption computation cost of our scheme are independent with the number of revoked users.

In such networks, instead of following the traditional fixed ITU-T wavelength grid, optical transponders are capable of properly tuning their rates, and consequently their spectrum occupation, by introducing the fine-granular spectrum unit, called a frequency slot. The number of contiguous frequency slots allocated to an optical path (i.e., lightpath) is adjusted to the current network flow. In this study, we propose a novel shared protection specific to elastic networks, namely, elastic separate-protection-at-connection (ESPAC). It not only provides traditional backup sharing, but also offers a new opportunity of spectrum sharing enabled by the elasticity of the transponders: 1) if the working paths of two connections are link disjoint physically, and 2) if their backup paths traverse two lightpaths which are adjacent on a fiber link, then the two backup lightpaths can share spectrum. The new opportunity of spectrum sharing is realized by using First-Fit to assign working traffic and Last-Fit to assign backup traffic, and allowing spectrum overlap between adjacent backup wavelengths. The elasticity of the transponder enables the expansion and contraction of the lightpaths, thus when a single failure occurs in the network, lightpaths carrying backup flows can be tuned to appropriate rates in such a way that the overlap spectrum is used by only one of the adjacent lightpaths. The results show ESPAC is very spectrum efficient in elastic network setting.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6415271/06374628.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"909","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2231663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2231663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survivable Traffic Grooming in Elastic Optical Networks\u2014Shared Protection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transponders","Optical fiber networks","Indexes","Bandwidth","WDM networks","Radio spectrum management","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication traffic","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic optical networks","survivable traffic grooming problem","flexible spectrum grid","transmission technology","fixed ITU-T wavelength grid","optical transponders","spectrum occupation","fine granular spectrum unit","contiguous frequency slots","optical path","current network flow","elastic separate protection at connection","ESPAC","spectrum sharing","transponder elasticity","adjacent backup wavelength","elastic network setting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic provisioning","elastic optical network","shared protection","spectrum assignment","traffic grooming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Survivable Traffic Grooming in Elastic Optical Networks\u2014Shared Protection","volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6374628/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13244906","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survivable Traffic Grooming in Elastic Optical Networks\u2014Shared Protection","sourcePdf":"jlt-liu-2231663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10007S","chronDate":"March15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6415271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6415271","articleId":"6374628","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374639,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Shun Chang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Shun","lastName":"Chang","id":"38541112500"},{"name":"Chien-Yuan Huang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Yuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37836534900"},{"name":"Yuan-Heng Tseng","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Heng","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37402077700"},{"name":"Ya-Chin King","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ya-Chin","lastName":"King","id":"37267116800"},{"name":"Chrong-Jung Lin","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chrong-Jung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37349659300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6374639","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A novel contact resistive random access memory (CRRAM) device based a temperature sensor is proposed and investigated in this letter.

The new sensing scheme is very suitable to low-power low-speed sensor modules.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Noise","Temperature dependence","Wireless sensor networks","Charge carrier processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparators (circuits)","low-power electronics","random noise","random-access storage","temperature measurement","temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature sensing scheme","random telegraph noise","contact RRAM device","contact resistive random access memory device","CRRAM RTN signal","comparator circuit","digital output temperature sensor","temperature-dependent RTN signal","low-power low-speed sensor modules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contact resistive random access memory (CRRAM)","random telegraph noise (RTN)","temperature sensor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374639","doi":"10.1109/LED.2012.2226137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6387615/06374639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2012.2226137","startPage":"12","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Sensing Scheme Through Random Telegraph Noise in Contact RRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Sensing Scheme Through Random Telegraph Noise in Contact RRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374639/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2012","volume":"34","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6374639/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188615","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Sensing Scheme Through Random Telegraph Noise in Contact RRAM","sourcePdf":"led-chang-2226137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067277S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6387615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6387615","articleId":"6374639","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374649,"authors":[{"name":"Jehan Akbar","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Jehan","lastName":"Akbar","id":"37713251800"},{"name":"Lianping Hou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Lianping","lastName":"Hou","id":"37287700900"},{"name":"Mohsin Haji","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Mohsin","lastName":"Haji","id":"37411324400"},{"name":"Michael J.

Process variations are based on the ITRS and modeled at device (TCAD) level. We propose a method to incorporate them into a BSIM-CMG model card for time-efficient simulation. We analyze cells with different fin numbers, supply voltages, and temperatures. Results show a 1.8\u00d7 improvement of RSNM for 8T SRAM cells, the need for stronger pull-downs to secure read stability in 6Ts, and high leakage sensitivity to temperature (10\u00d7 between 40\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C). As a specific example, we show how the RSNM of a 6T SRAM cell can be improved by using back-gate biasing techniques for independent-gate FinFETs. We show how WLMN is increased by reducing the strength of pull-up transistors when reverse back-gate biasing is applied on it and how the RSNM can be increased by reducing the strength of access transistor by reverse back-gate biasing of pass-gate transistors. When combining these two techniques, RSNM can be improved up to 25% without compromising cell write ability for any sample. In general, when compared to previous technologies, read stability is untouched, writeability is reduced, and leakage keeps stable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374661/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13187773","volume":"60","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SRAM Cells for 10-nm SOI FinFETs Under Process and Environmental Variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SRAM Cells for 10-nm SOI FinFETs Under Process and Environmental Variations","sourcePdf":"ted-jaksic-2226095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111919S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6387647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6387647","articleId":"6374661","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374663,"authors":[{"name":"Bipin Rajendran","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

UWB SAR detection involves three steps: imaging, prescreening, and discrimination. Many studies have concentrated on imaging and discrimination, whereas few have highlighted prescreening. We propose a novel prescreening method for extracting the region of interest from an entire SAR image. The proposed method is based on feature point matching in contrast to traditional approaches, which are based on the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) technique. Our method incorporates knowledge on the electromagnetic scattering caused by land mines into the prescreening process and does not rely on clutter environments. Thus, the method more efficiently eliminates nonhomogeneous clutter than do CFAR-based methods and is more advantageous in processing large-area SAR images. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated by real data on an airship-mounted UWB SAR system.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2220552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6516926/06374672.pdf","startPage":"3706","endPage":"3714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2012.2220552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Prescreening Method for Land-Mine Detection in UWB SAR Based on Feature Point Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374672/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Prescreening Method for Land-Mine Detection in UWB SAR Based on Feature Point Matching","volume":"51","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13502214","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374672/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Prescreening Method for Land-Mine Detection in UWB SAR Based on Feature Point Matching","sourcePdf":"tgrs-lou-2220552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124838S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6516926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6516926","articleId":"6374672","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6374674,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Sun","affiliation":["Automotive Engineering Research Institute, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6545313/6374674/6374674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Sun (M'12) was born in Jiangsu, China, in 1981.

The performance is good both asymptotically, since the belief propagation thresholds approach the Shannon limit, as well as for finite lengths, since degree-2 variable nodes that result in high error floors can be completely avoided. However, to realize the promised good performance, one needs large blocklengths. This in turn implies a large latency and decoding complexity. For the memoryless binary erasure channel, we consider the decoding of spatially coupled codes through a windowed decoder that aims to retain many of the attractive features of belief propagation, while trying to reduce complexity further. We characterize the performance of this scheme by defining thresholds on channel erasure rates that guarantee a target erasure rate. We give analytical lower bounds on these thresholds and show that the performance approaches that of belief propagation exponentially fast in the window size. We give numerical results including the thresholds computed using density evolution and the erasure rate curves for finite-length spatially coupled codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","volume":"59","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13382370","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374679/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Windowed Decoding of Spatially Coupled Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Windowed Decoding of Spatially Coupled Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-iyengar-2231465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185665S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6479338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6479338","articleId":"6374679","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6374680,"authors":[{"name":"Mattias Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of Safety Electronics and Functions, Volvo Car Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6521414/6374680/6374680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mattias Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2004.

An important aspect of these systems is not only assisting the driver when needed but also not disturbing the driver with unnecessary interventions. Aimed at improving both of these properties, a probabilistic framework is presented for jointly evaluating the driver acceptance of an intervention and the necessity thereof to automatically avoid a collision. The intervention acceptance is modeled as high if it estimated that the driver judges the situation as critical, based on the driver's observations and predictions of the traffic situation. One advantage with the proposed framework is that interventions can be initiated at an earlier stage when the estimated driver acceptance is high. Using a simplified driver model, the framework is applied to a few different types of collision scenarios. The results show that the framework has appealing properties, both with respect to increasing the system benefit and to decreasing the risk of unnecessary interventions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374680/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13529325","volume":"14","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Framework for Decision-Making in Collision Avoidance Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Framework for Decision-Making in Collision Avoidance Systems","sourcePdf":"tits-brannstrom-2227474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075884S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6521414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6521414","articleId":"6374680","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374683,"authors":[{"name":"Nghia Q.

In order to solve both problems simultaneously, in this invited paper, we describe several hybrid coded-modulation (CM) schemes enabling multiterabit optical transport including spatial-domain-based CM, mode-multiplexed 4-D CM, and mode-multiplexed generalized orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. A common property of these CM schemes is the employment of optimized signal constellations, various degrees of freedom, and rate-adaptive coding. These modulation schemes are called hybrid as all available degrees of freedom are used for transmission over optical fibers including amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Since the channel capacity is a linear function in number of dimensions, by increasing the number of basis functions, we can dramatically improve the overall system capacity. The energy-consumption problem is tackled by properly designing multidimensional signal constellations such that trans-information is maximized, while taking the energy constraint into account.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2232391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2232391","startPage":"3888","endPage":"3901","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6374256/06374696.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-Domain-Based Hybrid Multidimensional Coded-Modulation Schemes Enabling Multi-Tb/s Optical Transport*","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2012","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-Domain-Based Hybrid Multidimensional Coded-Modulation Schemes Enabling Multi-Tb/s Optical Transport*","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","volume":"30","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374696/","accessionNumber":"13167390","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374696/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-Domain-Based Hybrid Multidimensional Coded-Modulation Schemes Enabling Multi-Tb/s Optical Transport*","sourcePdf":"jlt-djordjevic-2232391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163946S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6374256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6374256","articleId":"6374696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6374697,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Our theoretical results are then compared to empirical probabilities obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we present numerical reconstructions with and without prior information, as well as a simulation to illustrate how prior information can be used to improve reconstruction, for example, in the context of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing With Prior Information: Requirements and Probabilities of Reconstruction in \ud835\udcc1<sub>1</sub>- Minimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2231076","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6492148/06374697.pdf","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2231076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492148","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing With Prior Information: Requirements and Probabilities of Reconstruction in \ud835\udcc1<sub>1</sub>- Minimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2013","publicationDate":"May1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13412987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing With Prior Information: Requirements and Probabilities of Reconstruction in \ud835\udcc1<sub>1</sub>- Minimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-miosso-2231076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085286S","chronDate":"May1,  2013","isNumber":"6492148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","articleId":"6374697","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374700,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"38187655300"},{"name":"Zongben Xu","affiliation":["Institute for Information and System Sciences, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zongben","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086192342"},{"name":"Shihua Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281408500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6374700","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Complexity theory","Joints","Wireless communication","Estimation","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational-inference-based data detection","OFDM system","imperfect channel estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","maximum a posteriori","MAP scheme","optimization problem","variational free energy","channel state information","CSI","turbo equalization","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel imperfections","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","variational inference"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the problem of joint estimation of data and channels for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems using variational inference.

We focus on the read and write performances of a STT-MRAM based cache rather than the obvious advantages such as the denser bit-cell and zero static power. An accurate MTJ macromodel capturing key MTJ properties was adopted for efficient Monte Carlo simulations. For the simulation of access devices and peripheral circuitries, ITRS projected transistor parameters were utilized and calibrated using the MASTAR tool that has been widely used in industry. 6T SRAM and STT-MRAM arrays were implemented with aggressive assist schemes to mimic industrial memory designs.

Our studies based on the proposed scaling methodology show that in-plane STT-MRAM will outperform SRAM from 15 nm node, while its perpendicular counterpart requires further innovations in MTJ material in order to overcome the poor write performance scaling from 22 nm node onwards.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","volume":"48","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13251807","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374706/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Scaling Roadmap and Performance Evaluation of In-Plane and Perpendicular MTJ Based STT-MRAMs for High-Density Cache Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scaling Roadmap and Performance Evaluation of In-Plane and Perpendicular MTJ Based STT-MRAMs for High-Density Cache Memory","sourcePdf":"jssc-kim-2224256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104427S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6419809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"6419809","articleId":"6374706","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6374707,"authors":[{"name":"Farhana Sheikh","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6399535/6374707/6374707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhana Sheikh (M'93) received the B.Eng. degree in systems and computer engineering (with high distinction, Chancellor's Medal) from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, in 1993 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1996 and 2008, respectively.","from 1993 to 1994 she worked at Nortel Networks as a software engineer in firmware and embedded system design.

They should be well tuned to track the changes of a production environment to obtain better operational performance. This paper presents an adaptive dispatching rule (ADR) whose parameters are determined dynamically by real-time information relevant to scheduling. First, we introduce the workflow of ADR that considers both batch and non-batch processing machines to obtain improved fab-wide performance. It makes use of such information as due date of a job, workload of a machine, and occupation time of a job on a machine. Then, we use a backward propagation neural network (BPNN) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the relations between weighting parameters and real-time state information to adapt these parameters dynamically to the environment. Finally, a real fab simulation model is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The simulation results show that ADR with constant weighting parameters outperforms the conventional dispatching rule on average; ADR with changing parameters tracking real-time production information over time is more robust than ADR with constant ones; and further improvements can be obtained by optimizing the weights and threshold values of BPNN with a PSO algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2012.2221087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6493467/06374713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2012.2221087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493467","startPage":"354","endPage":"364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dispatching Rule for Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Facility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dispatching Rule for Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Facility","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413128","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374713/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dispatching Rule for Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Facility","sourcePdf":"tase-zhou-2221087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122293S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6493467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6493467","articleId":"6374713","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374714,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Ding","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Ding","id":"38309598700"},{"name":"Jason Poon","affiliation":["MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Poon","id":"37595332100"},{"name":"Ivan \u010celanovi\u0107","affiliation":["MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"\u010celanovi\u0107","id":"37319587800"},{"name":"Alejandro D.

The structure of these filters is similar to that of a piecewise linear observer and in the absence of faults the filter residual converges to zero. On the other hand, whenever a fault occurs, by appropriately choosing the filter gain, the filter residual will exhibit certain geometric characteristics that allow the fault to be detected and, in certain cases, also isolated. Key advantages of these filters include fast detection of all possible component faults and the ability to capture slow degradation in individual components. In order to experimentally demonstrate their feasibility, the filters are implemented on an ultra-fast application-specific real-time processor. While the theoretical framework developed is general, the analysis, simulations, and experiments are focused on widely used power electronics systems implementing three-phase AC-DC converters that are used in, e.g., motor drive applications and distributed static compensators.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221222","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1051","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6486561/06374714.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6486561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation Filters for Three-Phase AC-DC Power Electronics Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Switches","Fault detection","Observers","Integrated circuit modeling","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault isolation filters","three-phase ac-dc power electronics systems","high-fidelity model-based fault detection","filter residual converges","three-phase AC-DC converters","motor drive applications","distributed static compensators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault detection and isolation","field programmable gate arrays","observers","three-phase AC-DC converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation Filters for Three-Phase AC-DC Power Electronics Systems","volume":"60","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398265","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Isolation Filters for Three-Phase AC-DC Power Electronics Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsi-dominguezgarcia-2221222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049667S","chronDate":"April  2013","isNumber":"6486561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"32","articleId":"6374714","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6374718,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6389787/6374718/6374718-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqian Li was born in Hebei, China, in 1987.

The dc-link fault is an issue MMC-HVDC must deal with, especially for the nonpermanent faults when using overhead lines. This paper proposed a protection scheme to implement fast fault clearance and automatic recovery for nonpermanent faults on dc lines. By employing double thyristor switches, the freewheeling effect of diodes is eliminated and the dc-link fault current is allowed to freely decay to zero. Then, the dc arc can be naturally extinguished and the insulation on the short-circuit point can be restored. The thyristor switches convert the dc-link fault into an ac short circuit of the ac grid through MMC arms. The ac short-circuit current can be cleared simply by turning off all thyristor switches. Since circuit breakers are not tripped during fault clearance, MMC can immediately and automatically rebuild the dc-link voltage and restart power transmission. Simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC have verified the validity of the proposed protection scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6389787/06374718.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2226249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2226249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6389787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection of Nonpermanent Faults on DC Overhead Lines in MMC-Based HVDC Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Thyristors","Fault currents","Switches","Insulation","HVDC transmission","Circuit breakers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","power overhead lines","power transmission faults","power transmission protection","short-circuit currents","thyristor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonpermanent faults protection","DC overhead lines","MMC based HVDC Systems","high voltage direct current system","modular multilevel converter","grid integration","automatic recovery","short circuit point","thyristor switches","AC grid","PSCAD/EMTDC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC fault","fault clearance","modular multilevel converter (MMC)","nonpermanent fault","system recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Protection of Nonpermanent Faults on DC Overhead Lines in MMC-Based HVDC Systems","volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6374718/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188765","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection of Nonpermanent Faults on DC Overhead Lines in MMC-Based HVDC Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-li-2226249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064287S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6389787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"6389787","articleId":"6374718","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6374722,"authors":[{"name":"Oussama Souihli","affiliation":["MEBIOS-Center for Integrated Medical Research, Keio University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Oussama","lastName":"Souihli","id":"37393019000"},{"name":"Tomoaki Ohtsuki","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Ohtsuki","id":"37268988400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6374722","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1417},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Scattering","Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Channel models","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","channel estimation","electromagnetic wave scattering","graph theory","MIMO communication","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rich scattering benefit","MIMO channel","multiple- input multiple-output propagation environment","MIMO propagation environment","graph-theoretical channel model","channel capacity","subgraph interconnection","channel adjacency matrix","full pilot-based channel estimation","antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","wireless propagation","wireless channel modeling","spectral graph theory"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the impact of scattering on a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) propagation environment is studied based on a recently-proposed graph-theoretical channel model. An old result that rich scattering in MIMO propagation environments is a requisite for the channel matrix to have full rank (equivalently for the channel capacity to scale linearly with the number of antennas) is verified. Then, novel insights on the importance of scattering in MIMO channels from a graph-theoretical perspective are provided. By showing that the adjacency matrix of the whole propagation channel has same spectrum (eigenvalues) as the sub-graph inter-connecting the scatterers, it is inferred that all graph-theoretical properties of the propagation graph are contained in the scattering fraction of the channel. In particular, it is inferred that the channel model can be almost-surely reconstructed from the sole knowledge of the spectrum of the sub-graph interconnecting the scatterers. These results may find application in MIMO channel modeling in settings where full pilot-based channel estimation is infeasible or impractical, as in high-mobility scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.120312.121184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6418082/06374722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.120312.121184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418082","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of Rich Scattering in MIMO Channels: A Graph-Theoretical Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of Rich Scattering in MIMO Channels: A Graph-Theoretical Perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250328","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benefits of Rich Scattering in MIMO Channels: A Graph-Theoretical Perspective","sourcePdf":"023-cl1301-souihli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060869S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6418082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6418082","articleId":"6374722","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374723,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Steadman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Steadman","id":"38547800800"},{"name":"Ivan Fair","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Fair","id":"37281019400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6374723","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We outline the construction of simple, high rate constrained sequence codes with variable-length source words and variable-length codewords based on the search of partial extension of a minimal set of codeword lengths.

We change the rule of selecting new frozen bits when the decoder requests more information. In our scheme, new frozen bits are chosen according to successive cancellation (SC) decoding instead of Bhattacharyya parameter. On receipt of a new frozen bit, SC decoding will continue from the new bit rather than restart from the first one. The novel scheme eliminates the recalculation of the previously decoded bits while reaching a competitive compression rates compared with alternatives. Furthermore, we derive a method for computing the average compression rates of the schemes in this paper, which match with the simulation results properly. Analysis shows that our novel scheme can reduce the decoding complexity significantly.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2012.120312.121536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2012.120312.121536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6418082/06374724.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Rate-Adaptive Distributed Source Coding Scheme Using Polar Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Rate-Adaptive Distributed Source Coding Scheme Using Polar Codes","volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250330","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374724/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Rate-Adaptive Distributed Source Coding Scheme Using Polar Codes","sourcePdf":"143-cl1301-lv.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035808S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6418082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6418082","articleId":"6374724","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6374730,"authors":[{"name":"Cagatay Candan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, M.E.T.U., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cagatay","lastName":"Candan","id":"37449269100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6374730","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374730","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Noise measurement","Receivers","Random variables","Transmitters","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-outage capacity scheme","CSIT","frequency flat single-input multiple-output channel","SIMO","imprecise channel state information at the transmitter side","radio receiver","signal-to-noise-ratio","ergodic capacity","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero-outage scheme","outage capacity","ergodic capacity","imprecise CSI"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of zero-outage scheme with imprecise channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) for frequency flat, single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels is examined.

Due to the fundamental differences between wired and wireless networks, extending NC to wireless networks generates several new and significant practical challenges. Two-way information exchange (both symmetric and asymmetric) between a pair of 802.11 sources/sinks using an intermediate relay node is a canonical scenario for evaluating the effectiveness of Wireless Network Coding (WNC) in a practical setting.

Our results show that network coding (at the MAC or PHY layer) increases system throughput-typically by 20-30%.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.130823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6565522/06374737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.130823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565522","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Network Coding via Modified 802.11 MAC/PHY: Design and Implementation on SDR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Network Coding via Modified 802.11 MAC/PHY: Design and Implementation on SDR","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13655724","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374737/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Network Coding via Modified 802.11 MAC/PHY: Design and Implementation on SDR","sourcePdf":"1618jsac0813firooz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081878S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6565522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6565522","articleId":"6374737","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374740,"authors":[{"name":"Chueh-Yu Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chueh-Yu","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38066221700"},{"name":"Austin Ying-Kuang Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent/Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ"],"firstName":"Austin Ying-Kuang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403710500"},{"name":"Changzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Changzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086630856"},{"name":"Ching-Hsing Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Hsing","lastName":"Luo","id":"37292272600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6374740","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":982},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) slow-wave elevated coplanar waveguide (ECPW) power divider/combiner fabricated in the back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) of a 90 nm CMOS technology.

Based on the implicit function theorem and mean value theorem, both state feedback and output feedback direct adaptive controls are developed using neural networks (NNs) and a disturbance observer. A compounded disturbance is defined to take into account of the effect of the unknown external disturbance, the unknown nonsymmetric input saturation, and the approximation error of NN. Then, a disturbance observer is developed to estimate the unknown compounded disturbance, and it is established that the estimate error converges to a compact set if appropriate observer design parameters are chosen. Both state feedback and output feedback direct adaptive controls can guarantee semiglobal uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system signals as rigorously proved by Lyapunov analysis. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed direct adaptive neural control techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2226577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6557475/06374742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2226577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6557475","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems Based on Disturbance Observer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems Based on Disturbance Observer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13705224","pubMedId":"26502431","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6374742/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Nonaffine Nonlinear Systems Based on Disturbance Observer","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chen-2226577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167768S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6557475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"6557475","articleId":"6374742","onlineDate":"27 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6374752,"authors":[{"name":"Edson L.

Some scientific applications still claim more speed and the community expects to reach exascale by the end of the decade. Nevertheless, to reach exascale we need to search alternatives to cope with energy constraints. A promising step forward in this direction is the usage of low power processors such as ARM. ARM processors target low power consumption in contrast with Xeon that are conventional on HPC aiming at computing speed. This paper presents a comparison between ARM and Xeon to evaluate if ARM is the future building block to HPC. We choose to use time-to-solution, peak power, and energy-to-solution to evaluate both processors from the user's perspective. The results point that although ARM having lower peak power, Xeon has still a better tradeoff from the user's point-of-view.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WAMCA.2012.10","doi":"10.1109/WAMCA.2012.10","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Third Workshop on Applications for Multi-Core Architecture","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374284/6374743/06374752.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","publicationTitle":"2012 Third Workshop on Applications for Multi-Core Architecture","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-to-Solution and Energy-to-Solution: A Comparison between ARM and Xeon","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-to-Solution and Energy-to-Solution: A Comparison between ARM and Xeon","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"24-25 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171254","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374752/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-to-Solution and Energy-to-Solution: A Comparison between ARM and Xeon","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4916a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061533S","chronDate":"24-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374284","isNumber":"6374743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374284","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6374743","articleId":"6374752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374766,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Kai-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin Kai-Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"38265496300"},{"name":"Rachata Ausavarungnirun","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Rachata","lastName":"Ausavarungnirun","id":"38266728400"},{"name":"Chris Fallin","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Fallin","id":"38075797600"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4907-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4790-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6374766","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Adaptive systems","Throughput","Routing","Switches","Radiation detectors","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HAT","heterogeneous adaptive throttling","NoC","network-on-chip","chip multiprocessor system","CMP system","network congestion","source-throttling congestion control","network traffic","source-throttling congestion control mechanism","application-aware throttling","network-load-aware throttling rate adjustment","network-bandwidth-intensive applications","latency-sensitive applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["on-chip networks","congestion control","application awareness","multicore"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374766","abstract":"The network-on-chip (NoC) is a primary shared resource in a chip multiprocessor (CMP) system. As core counts continue to increase and applications become increasingly data-intensive, the network load will also increase, leading to more congestion in the network. This network congestion can degrade system performance if the network load is not appropriately controlled. Prior works have proposed source-throttling congestion control, which limits the rate at which new network traffic (packets) enters the NoC in order to reduce congestion and improve performance. These prior congestion control mechanisms have shortcomings that significantly limit their performance: either 1) they are not application-aware, but rather throttle all applications equally regardless of applications' sensitivity to latency, or 2) they are not network-load-aware, throttling according to application characteristics but sometimes under- or over-throttling the cores. In this work, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptive Throttling, or HAT, a new source-throttling congestion control mechanism based on two key principles: application-aware throttling and network-load-aware throttling rate adjustment. First, we observe that only network-bandwidth-intensive applications(those which use the network most heavily) should be throttled, allowing the other latency-sensitive applications to make faster progress without as much interference. Second, we observe that the throttling rate which yields the best performance varies between workloads, a single, static, throttling rate under-throttles some workloads while over-throttling others. Hence, the throttling mechanism should observe network load dynamically and adjust its throttling rate accordingly. While some past works have also used a closed-loop control approach, none have been application-aware. HAT is the first mechanism to combine application-awareness and network-load-aware throttling rate adjustment to address congestion in a NoC. We evaluate HAT using a wide variety of multiprogrammed workloads on several NoC-based CMP systems with 16-, 64-, and 144-cores and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art congestion control mechanisms. Our evaluations show that HAT consistently provides higher system performance and fairness than prior congestion control mechanisms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374764","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374354/6374764/06374766.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2012.44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2012.44","startPage":"9","endPage":"18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAT: Heterogeneous Adaptive Throttling for On-Chip Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374766/","displayDocTitle":"HAT: Heterogeneous Adaptive Throttling for On-Chip Networks","htmlLink":"/document/6374766/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13171289","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAT: Heterogeneous Adaptive Throttling for On-Chip Networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4907a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0721S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374354","isNumber":"6374764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374354","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6374764","articleId":"6374766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374767,"authors":[{"name":"Ardavan Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Ardavan","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37299270000"},{"name":"Andreas Gerstlauer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Gerstlauer","id":"37282173200"},{"name":"Robert A. van de Geijn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Robert A.","lastName":"van de Geijn","id":"37331519800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4907-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4790-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6374767","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374767","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Arrays","Symmetric matrices","Vectors","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","file organisation","parallel processing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["register file","broadcast interconnect","collective communications","data parallel hardware accelerators","power consumption","broadcast buses","linear algebra","matrix transposition","SIMD","energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Register-file","Broadcast bus","Matrix Multiply","Power efficiency","High performance computing"]}],"abstract":"Reducing power consumption and increasing efficiency is a key concern for many applications. How to design highly efficient computing elements while maintaining enough flexibility within a domain of applications is a fundamental question. In this paper, we present how broadcast buses can eliminate the use of power hungry multi-ported register files in the context of data-parallel hardware accelerators for linear algebra operations. We demonstrate an algorithm/architecture co-design for the mapping of different collective communication operations, which are crucial for achieving performance and efficiency in most linear algebra routines, such as GEMM, SYRK and matrix transposition. We compare a broadcast bus based architecture with conventional SIMD, 2D-SIMD and flat register file for these operations in terms of area and energy efficiency. Results show that fast broadcast data movement abilities in a prototypical linear algebra core can achieve up to 75\u00d7 better power and up to 10\u00d7 better area efficiency compared to traditional SIMD architectures.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374354/6374764/06374767.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2012.35","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2012.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Efficiency of Register File versus Broadcast Interconnect for Collective Communications in Data-Parallel Hardware Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Efficiency of Register File versus Broadcast Interconnect for Collective Communications in Data-Parallel Hardware Accelerators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374767/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374767/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171290","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Efficiency of Register File versus Broadcast Interconnect for Collective Communications in Data-Parallel Hardware Accelerators","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4907a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097349S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374354","isNumber":"6374764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374354","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6374764","articleId":"6374767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6374779,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Richards","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Richards","id":"38526569500"},{"name":"Abhishek Gupta","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37855892600"},{"name":"Osman Sarood","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Sarood","id":"37888387100"},{"name":"Laxmikant V.

In this paper, we address the parallelization of information set generation in the context of Kriegspiel (partially observable chess). We implement the algorithm on top of a general purpose combinatorial search engine and discuss its performance using datasets from real game instances in addition to benchmarks. Further, we demonstrate the effect of load balancing strategies, problem sizes and computational granularity (grain size parameters) on performance.

However, the scalability of DRAM is approaching its limit, so Phase-Change Memory (PCM) is being considered as an alternative technology. PCM is denser, more scalable, and consumes lower idle power than DRAM, while exhibiting byte-address ability and access times in the nanosecond range. Unfortunately, PCM is also slower than DRAM and has limited endurance. These characteristics prompted the study of hybrid memory systems, combining a small amount of DRAM and a large amount of PCM. In this paper, we leverage hybrid memories to improve the performance of cooperative memory caches in server clusters. Our approach entails a novel policy that exploits popularity information in placing objects across servers and memory technologies. Our results show that (1) DRAM-only and PCM-only memory systems do not perform well in all cases, and (2) when managed properly, hybrid memories always exhibit the best or close-to-best performance, with significant gains in many cases, without increasing energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6374793/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13171316","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Phase-Change Memory in Cooperative Caches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Phase-Change Memory in Cooperative Caches","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"4907a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122224S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374354","isNumber":"6374764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374354","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6374764","articleId":"6374793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6374815,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e9ricles B.C.

However, the SVM performance depends on adjustments of its parameters' values. The automatic SVM parameter selection is treated by many authors as an optimization problem whose goal is to find a suitable configuration of parameters for a given learning problem. This work performs a comparative study of combining Meta-Learning (ML) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) techniques for the SVM parameter selection problem. In this combination, configurations of parameters provided by ML are adopted as initial search points of the MOPSO techniques. Our hypothesis is that, starting the search with reasonable solutions will speed up the process performed by the MOPSO techniques. In our work, we implemented three MOPSO techniques applied to select two SVM parameters for classification. Our work's aim is to optimize the SVMs by seeking for configurations of parameters which maximize the success rate and minimize the number of support vectors (i.e., two objetive functions). In the experiments, the performance of the search algorithms using a traditional random initialization was compared to the performance achieved by initializing the search process using the ML suggestions. We verified that the combination of the techniques with ML obtained solutions with higher quality on a set of 40 classification problems.","doi":"10.1109/SBRN.2012.12","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRN.2012.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374814","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374355/6374814/06374815.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Meta-Learning with Multi-objective Particle Swarm Algorithms for SVM Parameter Selection: An Experimental Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374815/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combining Meta-Learning with Multi-objective Particle Swarm Algorithms for SVM Parameter Selection: An Experimental Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374815/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13171325","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Meta-Learning with Multi-objective Particle Swarm Algorithms for SVM Parameter Selection: An Experimental Analysis","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4823a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055989S","chronDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374355","isNumber":"6374814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374355","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6374814","articleId":"6374815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6374832,"authors":[{"name":"Adenilton J. da Silva","affiliation":["Centro de Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Adenilton J.","lastName":"da Silva","id":"37854053200"},{"name":"Teresa B.

The proposed algorithm is based on the well-known technique Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374841/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13171351","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374841/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Fuzzy Partitions and T-Norm Parameters in Fuzzy Classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Genetic Optimization of Fuzzy Partitions and T-Norm Parameters in Fuzzy Classifiers","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4823a154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095103S","chronDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374355","isNumber":"6374814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374355","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6374814","articleId":"6374841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6374844,"authors":[{"name":"Olacir Rodrigues Castro Junior","affiliation":["Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Paran\u00e1"],"firstName":"Olacir Rodrigues","lastName":"Castro Junior","id":"37086900004"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Britto","affiliation":["Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Paran\u00e1"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Britto","id":"38467751500"},{"name":"Aurora Pozo","affiliation":["Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Curitiba, Paran\u00e1"],"firstName":"Aurora","lastName":"Pozo","id":"37330236900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2641-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4823-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0235"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4899"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-4899"}],"articleNumber":"6374844","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6374844","abstract":"A well-known problem faced by Pareto Based Multi Objective Optimization Algorithms, including Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithms is the deterioration of its search ability when the number of objectives scales up.

This work aims to propose a new MOPSO algorithm called SCDAS-SMPSO which uses the Self-Controlling Dominance Area of Solutions (S-CDAS) technique to modify the domination relation and increase the selection pressure needed in many-objective optimization. The new MOPSO is compared through experiments with other two MOPSOs in terms of convergence and diversity in many-objective scenarios.

Evolving systems are high level adaptive systems able to simultaneously modify their structures and parameters from a stream of data, online. Learning from data streams is a contemporary and challenging issue due to the increasing rate of the size and temporal availability of data, turning traditional learning methods impracticable. Uninorm-based neurons, rooted in triangular norms and co norms, generalize fuzzy neurons. Uninorms bring flexibility and generality to fuzzy neuron models as they can behave like triangular norms, triangular co norms, or in between by adjusting identity elements. This feature adds a form of plasticity in neural network modeling. An online clustering method is used to granulate the input space, and a scheme based on extreme learning is developed to train the neural network. Computational results show that the learning approach is competitive when compared with alternative evolving modeling methods.","doi":"10.1109/SBRN.2012.14","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2012 Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRN.2012.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374814","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374355/6374814/06374848.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme Learning for Evolving Hybrid Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374848/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extreme Learning for Evolving Hybrid Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374848/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13171358","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme Learning for Evolving Hybrid Neural Networks","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"4823a196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060638S","chronDate":"20-25 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374355","isNumber":"6374814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374355","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6374814","articleId":"6374848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6374851,"authors":[{"name":"Helon Vicente Hultmann Ayala","affiliation":["Power Syst.

We use a probabilistic formulation of the problem in the 3D, reconstructed space that allows using features that cannot be matched one-to-one, or which cannot be precisely located, such as points along edges. The reconstructed scene, modelled as a probability distribution in the 3D space, is defined as the intersection of all reconstructions compatible with each available view. We introduce a method based on importance sampling to retrieve individual samples from that distribution, as well as an iterative method to identify contiguous regions of high density. This allows the reconstruction of continuous 3D curves compatible with all the given input views, without establishing specific correspondences and without relying on connectivity in the input images, while accounting for uncertainty in the input observations, due e.g.\\ to noisy images and poorly calibrated cameras. The technical formulation is attractive in its flexibility and genericity. The implemented system, evaluated on several very different publicly-available datasets, shows results competitive with existing methods, effectively dealing with arbitrary numbers of views, wide baselines and imprecise camera calibrations.","doi":"10.1109/3DIMPVT.2012.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIMPVT.2012.28","startPage":"160","endPage":"167","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization & Transmission","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374375/6374969/06374990.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization & Transmission","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-Based Multiview Reconstruction without Correspondences for 3D Edges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Multiview Reconstruction without Correspondences for 3D Edges","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6374990/","accessionNumber":"13171763","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6374990/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-Based Multiview Reconstruction without Correspondences for 3D Edges","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"4873a160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058091S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374375","isNumber":"6374969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374375","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6374969","articleId":"6374990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6375029,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Moreno","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37636569600"},{"name":"Gabriel Taubin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Taubin","id":"37282608000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4873-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4470-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6185"}],"articleNumber":"6375029","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":142,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3711},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Calibration","Software","Image resolution","Reflective binary codes","Image color analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","image processing","lenses","optical distortion","optical projectors","optical scanners","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["projector-camera calibration","structured-light systems","3D models","off-the-shelf components","data projector","laser scanners","robust calibration methods","mathematical model","projector calibration techniques","simplified model","precision loss","image coordinates","3D points","projector image plane","uncalibrated camera","homography","subpixel precision","camera model","extended pinhole model","radial distortion coefficients","tangential distortion coefficients","lens distortion models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["structured-light","camera","projector","calibration","local homography"]}],"abstract":"Structured-light systems are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple, Accurate, and Robust Projector-Camera Calibration","publicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization & Transmission","doi":"10.1109/3DIMPVT.2012.77","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Second International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization & Transmission","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374375/6374969/06375029.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIMPVT.2012.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Simple, Accurate, and Robust Projector-Camera Calibration","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375029/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171802","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple, Accurate, and Robust Projector-Camera Calibration","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"4873a464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098958S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374375","isNumber":"6374969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374375","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"6374969","articleId":"6375029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375080,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Bagwari","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Bagwari","id":"37706330900"},{"name":"Brahmjit Singh","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, India"],"firstName":"Brahmjit","lastName":"Singh","id":"37288664000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4850-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2981-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375080","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":761},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Detectors","Correlation","Feature extraction","Noise","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","matched filters","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing technique","cognitive radio network","wireless communication","primary user transmission","transmitter detection","matched filter detection","energy detection","cyclostationary feature detection","false alarm probability","miss detection probability","signal to noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio System","Spectrum Sensing","SNR","PU","CR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375080","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.66","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio is the key technology for future wireless communication.

In this paper, we consider three basic spectrum sensing techniques of transmitter detection: Matched filter detection, Energy detection, and Cyclostationary feature detection. Using simulations, a comparative analysis of the three techniques has been carried out in terms of probability of false alarm Pf, probability of detection alarm Pd, and probability of miss detection Pm. Finally, Numerical result shows that at low signal to noise ratio (SNR), cyclostationary feature detection outperforms other two techniques, thus have some difficulties like implementation is complex, long observation time, etc. For simulation we used MATLAB software.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","startPage":"98","endPage":"105","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375080.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Spectrum Sensing Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6375080/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Spectrum Sensing Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171470","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Performance Evaluation of Spectrum Sensing Techniques for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073817S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375085,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering IIT, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Jain","id":"37336185300"},{"name":"Narendra S.

Presently clustering through distributed methods is being developed for dealing with the issues like network lifetime and energy. In our work, we implemented both centralized and distributed k-means clustering algorithm in network simulator. k-means is a prototype based algorithm that alternates between two major steps, assigning observations to clusters and computing cluster centers until a stopping criterion is satisfied.

The system presented is designed to transmit a discrete time, continuous amplitude signal over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is used for error correction purposes. LDPC code is a channel coding technique that provides performance near to Shannon's limit. To achieve optimum decoding, Sum-Product or message passing decoding is used for LDPC codes. Code puncturing can be implemented to obtain different code rates and this can be used for implementing joint source channel coding. Here, Source coding and Channel coding can be done in a single step using LDPC codes by puncturing the transmitted information so as to make the rate greater than or equal to the entropy of the source.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source Channel Coding Using LDPC Codes","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.135","startPage":"355","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375132.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source Channel Coding Using LDPC Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375132/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171521","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source Channel Coding Using LDPC Codes","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048789S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375138,"authors":[{"name":"Vipul Dixit","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Comm.

In this paper, the performance of IDMA scheme has been examined as a multiple access technique for optical wireless communication (OWC) with indoor wireless channel model. The indoor propagation channel model which considers additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model as more appropriate for significant background light has been simulated. The simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in bit error rate (BER) performance of uncoded wireless optical IDMA in comparison to uncoded IDMA system with large user count.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375138.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optical IDMA System for Indoor Wireless Channel Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Optical transmitters","Adaptive optics","Optical pulses","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","code division multiple access","error statistics","indoor communication","optical communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical IDMA system","indoor wireless channel model","optical wireless channels","indoor data transfer","interleave-division multiple-access scheme","code-division multiple-access scheme","CDMA scheme","bit error rate","BER","optical wireless communication","OWC","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical-IDMA (OIDMA) scheme","Iterative Chip-by-Chip (CBC) Detection","On-Off Keying (OOK)","AWGN Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optical IDMA System for Indoor Wireless Channel Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375138/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171526","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Optical IDMA System for Indoor Wireless Channel Model","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059067S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":6375139,"authors":[{"name":"Aasheesh Shukla","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, GLA University, Mathura, India"],"firstName":"Aasheesh","lastName":"Shukla","id":"37401385200"},{"name":"Suneel Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, GLA University, Mathura, India"],"firstName":"Suneel","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085507607"},{"name":"Vishal Goyal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication, GLA University, Mathura, India"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Goyal","id":"37085859424"},{"name":"V.K.

In memory bank architecture SRAM is divided into 4 blocks with each block having equal capacity of 256b. Memory bank is selected using block selector circuit. The key of low power operation in the SRAM is to reduce the word line capacitance and bit line capacitances. The power dissipation is reduced to 78% in the circuit containing memory bank because in memory bank word line capacitance and bit line capacitance are reduced as only one bank is selected at a time and all the other remain in standby mode at the expense of 6.930% more transistor count. Speed is also improved by 23% in the architecture containing memory bank. Here sense amplifier, bit line conditioning circuit and decoder are also designed and verify various results.

The main types of oscilloscopes are analog oscilloscope, digital oscilloscope and PC based oscilloscope. From which the digital oscilloscope are widely used now a days due there accuracy portability, high speed, high resolution, data storing capability etc. here we provide an alternative solution which is basically a digital oscilloscope with almost all the control options which any standard digital oscilloscope has. It has basically three large blocks, first is the ADC part which has the analog to digital IC which convert the analog input signal into digital. This IC is controlled by the STK500 AVR kit. Second is the oscillator control part which is implanted on the FPGA Spartan 3 kit. It has the entire storage element and the user input control and driver part of IC and VGA. The third large block is display device which is a CRT monitor means the waveform result is shown on CRT monitor along this the LEDs and seven segment display part on FPGA is also used to display information. So this is a cheap alternative to expensive oscilloscopes, using a VGA display and a simple mouse interface, a user can use this scope to look at and measure signals up to about 80 MHz if an extra high frequency clock will provide to the design.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.88","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375158.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and VLSI Implementation of a Digital Oscilloscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375158/","displayDocTitle":"Design and VLSI Implementation of a Digital Oscilloscope","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171546","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375158/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and VLSI Implementation of a Digital Oscilloscope","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042443S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375163,"authors":[{"name":"Lijia Wang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Integrated Microsystems Science Engineering and Applications, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lijia","lastName":"Wang","id":"38525611500"},{"name":"Xinan Wang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Integrated Microsystems Science Engineering and Applications, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xinan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37072477400"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Integrated Microsystems Science Engineering and Applications, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38024062900"},{"name":"Qihua Yang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Integrated Microsystems Science Engineering and Applications, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qihua","lastName":"Yang","id":"38528755800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4850-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2981-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375163","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Estimation","System-on-a-chip","Power demand","Field programmable gate arrays","Integrated circuit modeling","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","network synthesis","power consumption","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level power estimation model","SOC","power consumption reduction","IC design","system-on-chip","anomalistic change","Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SoC","FPGA","High level Power Estimation","event signature"]}],"abstract":"Power consumption reduction has become a first-order requirement for modern IC design, and techniques of high level power estimation are urgently in need for the sake of achieving maximal power reduction with minimal cost by optimizing the design early in the design process. This paper presents a high level power estimation model for system-on-chip (SOC) architectures on FPGA. Working with a system-level SOC synthesis framework, the proposed model takes primary power data as foundation and power estimation is conducted with regard to major event signatures such as bus and memory read/write. Besides, the anomalistic change of LUT numbers in the hardware implementation process is then taken into account, which allows more accurate and efficient power estimation providing invaluable directions for further optimization process. With the proposed model, SOC architectures are designed, and power estimation results of the model are compared with the results from real measurements on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA board.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.124","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375163.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Level Power Estimation Model for SOC with FPGA Prototyping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375163/","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Power Estimation Model for SOC with FPGA Prototyping","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375163/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171551","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Power Estimation Model for SOC with FPGA Prototyping","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071825S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6375168,"authors":[{"name":"Deka Ganesh Chandra","affiliation":["DGE&T, MoLE, New Delhi-1, India"],"firstName":"Deka Ganesh","lastName":"Chandra","id":"38242322700"},{"name":"Robin Singh Bhadoria","affiliation":["IITM, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Robin Singh","lastName":"Bhadoria","id":"38235100300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4850-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2981-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375168","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Databases","Computational modeling","Electronic government","Communities","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","government data processing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing model","National e-Governance Plan","NeGP","e-government oriented technology","e-government service","ICT requirement","Executive branch","Legislative branch","Judicial branche","privacy requirement","security requirement","government transactions","government applications","cloud government","citizens","cost effective IT service delivery mechanism","India"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["e-Governance","Government Cloud","Census Data","NeGP"]}],"abstract":"Advances in e-Government oriented technologies and services are taking place with a considerable speed around the world.

In this work Opposition Based Learning (OBL) concept is used in a unique way for weight vector generation. Also to have diversity among solutions and proper exploration of search space opposition based learning concept is used for population initialization and both parent and opposite parent are allowed to reproduce.

In this paper the power and usefulness of the MRPSO algorithm is demonstrated through its application to three and six generator systems with ramp rate limit constraints.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.101","startPage":"632","endPage":"637","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375189.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic Load Dispatch Using MRPSO with Generator Ramp Rate Limits Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Economic Load Dispatch Using MRPSO with Generator Ramp Rate Limits Constraint","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375189/","accessionNumber":"13171577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375189/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic Load Dispatch Using MRPSO with Generator Ramp Rate Limits Constraint","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077888S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6375192,"authors":[{"name":"Vimal Singh Bisht","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Graphic Era Hill University, Bhimtal, India"],"firstName":"Vimal Singh","lastName":"Bisht","id":"38527393100"},{"name":"Gautam Shah","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department, Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Gautam","lastName":"Shah","id":"38528684700"},{"name":"Nikhil Kushwaha","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, N.I.T Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Kushwaha","id":"38235603500"},{"name":"Vaibhav Gupta","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, N.I.T Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vaibhav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086362862"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4850-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2981-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375192","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375192","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Reservoirs","Job shop scheduling","Discharges (electric)","Power systems","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","hydroelectric power stations","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power generation scheduling","thermal power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm solution","convex hydrothermal generation scheduling","short term hydrothermal scheduling problem","hydroplants","hydrogeneration","thermal units","economic load dispatch","load balancing","hydroreservoir","hydrothermal system","penalty factors","hydrothermal system generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-term hydrothermal scheduling","genetic algorithm","Constraint-handling","economic load dispatch","economic operation of power system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.120","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375192.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","startPage":"646","endPage":"650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Solution for a Convex Hydro-Thermal Generation Scheduling","abstract":"The paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm solution for solving a short term hydro thermal scheduling problem.

Linear control theory is not directly applicable on nonlinear systems and there are so many approximations if linear control theory is directly applied on nonlinear systems. There is no unique method for analyzing nonlinear systems. A back stepping like design approach for reduced-order nonlinear observers is proposed. The basic idea of this approach is as follows. First, an appropriate function of the state variables to be estimated is constructed. The next function of the state variables to be estimated is then derived by designing the previous nonlinear function observer. Finally the procedure terminates, resulting in a partial differential equation to be solved. If the resultant differential equation is solvable, then the observer can be calculated. The connection between observers with linear error dynamics and this approach is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2012.57","startPage":"838","endPage":"841","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374357/6375055/06375231.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2012.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backstepping Control of Continuous Nonlinear Systems Using Chebyshev Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","Backstepping","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","continuous systems","linear systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","partial differential equations","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backstepping control","continuous nonlinear system","Chebyshev neural network","linear system control","linear control theory","backstepping like design approach","reduced-order nonlinear observer","state variable estimation","nonlinear function observer","partial differential equation","linear error dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping","Chebyshev Neural networks","Lyapunov stability etc"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Backstepping Control of Continuous Nonlinear Systems Using Chebyshev Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375231/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13171619","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backstepping Control of Continuous Nonlinear Systems Using Chebyshev Neural Network","confLoc":"Mathura, India","sourcePdf":"4850a838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070275S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374357","isNumber":"6375055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374357","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6375055","articleId":"6375231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6375234,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

A number of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory have suggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a convex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors, each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of word-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of application areas, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al. is especially popular. Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's parameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches for the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and consequently have one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each document contains only one topic, or else can only recover the {\\em span} of the topic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves. This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a main tool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are nonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a fairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability, which is usually found to hold in real-life data. Perhaps the most attractive feature of our algorithm is that it generalizes to yet more realistic models that incorporate topic-topic correlations, such as the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) and the Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM). We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use NMF as a replacement for SVD -- just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many applications.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2012.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2012.49","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374356/6375275/06375276.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Topic Models -- Going beyond SVD","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Learning Topic Models -- Going beyond SVD","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375276/","accessionNumber":"13171368","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375276/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Topic Models -- Going beyond SVD","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"4874a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092538S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374356","isNumber":"6375275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374356","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6375275","articleId":"6375276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6375293,"authors":[{"name":"Zvika Brakerski","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Zvika","lastName":"Brakerski","id":"37281760800"},{"name":"Yael Tauman Kalai","affiliation":["Microsot Research, UK"],"firstName":"Yael Tauman","lastName":"Kalai","id":"37402729200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4874-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4383-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6375293","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Error analysis","Synchronization","Noise","Robustness","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","encoding","error correction codes","probability","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive coding","constant-rate adversarial noise","interactive protocols","interactive communication","error correcting codes","error-free channel","noisy channel","stochastic noise","communication complexity","CC","probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375293","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2012.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2012.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375275","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374356/6375275/06375293.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Interactive Coding against Adversarial Noise","abstract":"In this work, we study the problem of constructing interactive protocols that are robust to noise, a problem that was originally considered in the seminal works of Schulman (FOCS '92, STOC '93), and has recently regained popularity. Robust interactive communication is the interactive analogue of error correcting codes: Given an interactive protocol which is designed to run on an error-free channel, construct a protocol that evaluates the same function (or, more generally, simulates the execution of the original protocol) over a noisy channel. As in (non-interactive) error correcting codes, the noise can be either stochastic, i.e. drawn from some distribution, or adversarial, i.e. arbitrary subject only to a global bound on the number of errors. We show how to efficiently simulate any interactive protocol in the presence of constant-rate adversarial noise, while incurring only a constant blow-up in the communication complexity (CC).

In 1982, Beck conjectured that the discrepancy of this set system is O(1). In other words, the conjecture says that each integer from 1 through n can be colored either red or blue so that the number of red and blue integers in each interval of each permutations differs only by a constant. (The discrepancy of a set system based on two permutations is at most two.)

Our counterexample is based on a simple recursive construction, and our proof of the discrepancy lower bound is by induction. This construction also disproves a generalization of Beck's conjecture due to Spencer, Srinivasan and Tetali, who conjectured that a set \u221a system corresponding to \u00a3 permutations has discrepancy O(\u221a\u2113). Our work was inspired by an intriguing paper from SODA 2011 by Eisenbrand, Palvolgyi and Rothvo\u00df, who show a surprising connection between the discrepancy of three permutations and the bin packing problem: They show that Beck's conjecture implies a constant worst-case bound on the additive integrality gap for the Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation for bin packing in the special case when all items have sizes strictly between 1/4 and 1/2, also known as the three partition problem. Our counterexample shows that this approach to bounding the additive integrality gap for bin packing will not work. We can, however, prove an interesting implication of our construction in the reverse direction: there are instances of bin packing and corresponding optimal basic feasible solutions for the Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation such that any packing that contains only patterns from the support of these solutions requires at least opt + \u03a9(log m) bins, where m is the number of items. Finally, we discuss some implications that our construction has for other areas of discrepancy theory.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additives","Upper bound","Partitioning algorithms","Electronic mail","Computer science","Educational institutions","Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bin packing","computational complexity","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Beck three permutations conjecture","set system discrepancy","red integers","blue integers","positive integer","simple recursive construction","discrepancy lower bound","bin packing problem","constant worst-case bound","additive integrality gap","Gilmore-Gomory LP relaxation","three partition problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrepancy","bin packing","permutations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2012.84","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374356/6375275/06375303.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2012.84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beck's Three Permutations Conjecture: A Counterexample and Some Consequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beck's Three Permutations Conjecture: A Counterexample and Some Consequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375303/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375303/","accessionNumber":"13171395","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beck's Three Permutations Conjecture: A Counterexample and Some Consequences","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"4874a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064132S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374356","isNumber":"6375275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374356","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6375275","articleId":"6375303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6375318,"authors":[{"name":"Cynthia Dwork","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Dwork","id":"37355618700"},{"name":"Moni Naor","affiliation":["Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Moni","lastName":"Naor","id":"37371914800"},{"name":"Salil Vadhan","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Salil","lastName":"Vadhan","id":"37284565100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4874-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4383-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6375318","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"abstract":"We initiate the study of \"privacy for the analyst\" in differentially private data analysis.

This problem arises only in the context of stateful privacy mechanisms, in which the responses to queries depend on other queries posed (a recent wave of results in the area utilized cleverly coordinated noise and state in order to allow answering privately hugely many queries). We argue that the problem is real by proving an exponential gap between the number of queries that can be answered (with non-trivial error) by stateless and stateful differentially private mechanisms.

Furthermore, a small, deterministic and public alteration of the input is enough to assert that all singular values of D are large. We apply the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to the task of approximating cut-queries: the number of edges crossing a (S, S)-cut in a graph. We show that the JL transform allows us to publish a sanitized graph that preserves edge differential privacy (where two graphs are neighbors if they differ on a single edge) while adding only O(|S|\u03f5) random noise to any given query (w.h.p). Comparing the additive noise of our algorithm to existing algorithms for answering cut-queries in a differentially private manner, we outperform all others on small cuts (|S| = o(n)). We also apply our technique to the task of estimating the variance of a given matrix in any given direction. The JL transform allows us to publish a sanitized covariance matrix that preserves differential privacy w.r.t bounded changes (each row in the matrix can change by at most a norm-1 vector) while adding random noise of magnitude independent of the size of the matrix (w.h.p).

This enables us to obtain error-resilient formulas from error-resilient communication protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375327/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13171418","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375327/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Formulas Resilient to Short-Circuit Errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formulas Resilient to Short-Circuit Errors","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"4874a490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095845S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374356","isNumber":"6375275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374356","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6375275","articleId":"6375327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6375347,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Zhandry","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Zhandry","id":"38527108500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4874-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4383-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6375347","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375347","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Quantum computing","Standards","Polynomials","Synthesizers","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum computing","query processing","random functions","random number generation","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum random functions","quantum adversary","pseudorandom function security","standard-security","quantum-security proofs","quantum superposition","quantum queries","pseudorandom generators","pseudorandom synthesizers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum","Pseudorandom Function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2012.37","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374356/6375275/06375347.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2012.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Construct Quantum Random Functions","abstract":"In the presence of a quantum adversary, there are two possible definitions of security for a pseudorandom function. The first, which we call standard-security, allows the adversary to be quantum, but requires queries to the function to be classical. The second, quantum-security, allows the adversary to query the function on a quantum superposition of inputs, thereby giving the adversary a superposition of the values of the function at many inputs at once. Existing techniques for proving the security of pseudorandom functions fail when the adversary can make quantum queries. We give the first quantum-security proofs for pseudorandom functions by showing that some classical constructions of pseudorandom functions are quantum-secure. Namely, we show that the standard constructions of pseudorandom functions from pseudorandom generators or pseudorandom synthesizers are secure, even when the adversary can make quantum queries. We also show that a direct construction from lattices is quantum-secure. To prove security, we develop new tools to prove the indistinguishability of distributions under quantum queries. In light of these positive results, one might hope that all standard-secure pseudorandom functions are quantum-secure. To the contrary, we show a separation: under the assumption that standard-secure pseudorandom functions exist, there are pseudorandom functions secure against quantum adversaries making classical queries, but insecure once the adversary can make quantum queries.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375347/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13171438","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375347/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"How to Construct Quantum Random Functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Construct Quantum Random Functions","confLoc":"New Brunswick, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"4874a679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062697S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374356","isNumber":"6375275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374356","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6375275","articleId":"6375347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6375375,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Kimmitt","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Kimmitt","id":"38525987900"},{"name":"George Wilson","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Wilson","id":"38252048500"},{"name":"David Greaves","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Greaves","id":"37276898300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2666-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2665-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2664-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Logic gates","Hardware design languages","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Random access memory","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","safety-critical software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant computing","hardware synthesis flow","field-programmable gate array","fault-tolerant synthesis","safety-critical applications","modern processor implementations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new hardware synthesis flow, which generates an output verifiable in a field-programmable gate array.

People want large amount of data to be continuously accessible in their personal devices. Direct Sequence (DS) spread spectrum based techniques such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) fulfil these requirements but, at the same time, suffer from the Intersymbol Interference (ISI). Multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) is an emerging technology to be used in mobile devices operating in an ad hoc setting due to its immunity towards ISI and having all the advantages of spread spectrum communication. One of the major problems with MC-CDMA is the high sensitivity towards carrier frequency offsets caused due to the inherent inaccuracy of crystal oscillators. This carrier frequency offset destroys the orthogonality of the subcarriers resulting in Intercarrier Interference (ICI). In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and biquadratic Lagrange interpolation. The FFT is based on the use of overlapping windows for each frame of the data instead of non-overlapping windows. This gives a coarse estimate of the frequency offset which is refined by the successive application of Lagrange quadratic interpolation to the samples in the vicinity of FFT peak. The proposed algorithm has been applied to the multiuser ad hoc network and simulated in Stanford University Interim (SUI) channels. It has been shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm provides better performance of almost 4~5 dB as compared to the conventional FFT based algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified FFT and biquadratic interpolation based algorithm for carrier frequency offset estimation in MC-CDMA based ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2012.6375425","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362333/6375072/06375425.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2012.6375425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375425","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A modified FFT and biquadratic interpolation based algorithm for carrier frequency offset estimation in MC-CDMA based ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375425/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified FFT and biquadratic interpolation based algorithm for carrier frequency offset estimation in MC-CDMA based ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET2012Camera136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076104S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362333","isNumber":"6375072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362333","xplore-issue":"6375072","articleId":"6375425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6375427,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Yousaf","affiliation":["Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Yousaf","id":"38233862900"},{"name":"Mohsin Irshad","affiliation":["University of Western Ontario, London, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsin","lastName":"Irshad","id":"37646222200"},{"name":"Iftekhar Mehmood","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Studies in Engineering, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Iftekhar","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"38528017300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4451-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4452-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4450-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375427","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Radiation detectors","Clocks","Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Protocols","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","digital phase locked loops","embedded systems","field buses","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA board","digital phase lock loop","MIL-STD-1553B bus protocol","DPLL","data clock recovery","channel","receiver","encoded Manchester data processing","embedded system","system reliability","1553B bus transaction","UART","bus controller","Manchester encoder/decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIL-STD-1553B","FPGA","DPLL"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new technique for the implementation of MIL-STD-1553B bus protocol on FPGA board using digital phase lock loop is presented.

Simulation results show that DESAR protocol performs better than existing protocol in term of end-to-end delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375441/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13172147","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375441/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient delay and energy based routing in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient delay and energy based routing in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET2012Camera205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060906S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362333","isNumber":"6375072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362333","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6375072","articleId":"6375441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":6375444,"authors":[{"name":"Rabiah Badar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rabiah","lastName":"Badar","id":"37680867300"},{"name":"Laiq Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Laiq","lastName":"Khan","id":"37074624300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4451-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4452-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4450-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375444","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Oscillators","Power system stability","Damping","Rotors","Load flow","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","backpropagation","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","gradient methods","neurocontrollers","power generation reliability","power system control","static VAr compensators","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online adaptive neurofuzzy wavelet","SSSC control","power system oscillation damping","blackout","low frequency interarea oscillation","damping control device","Online NeuroFuzzy Wavelet Control","ONFW-C","auxiliary damping control","ADC","interarea oscillation damping","multimachine power system","static synchronous series compensator","control system parameter tuning","rotor speed error","gradient descent based back-propagation algorithm","model free direct control structure","computational complexity","latency","memory requirement","real time implementation","robustness","fault","operating condition","nonlinear time domain simulation","online neurofuzzy TSK control","ONFT-C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SSSC","adaptive NeuroFuzzy control","wavelets","gradient descent","multi-machine power system"]}],"abstract":"Major blackouts reported in the literature due to low frequency inter-area oscillations highlight the importance of efficient damping control devices.

We propose and discuss some strategies which involve open access femtocell deployment to aid the macrocell edge users in achieving their performance objectives. These femtocells can be deployed in various configurations near the macrocell edge. The macrocell edge users can then communicate through the nearby femtocell.

the past few years, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as a solution for the problems created due to fixed spectrum allocation such as inefficient usage of licensed spectrum. CRNs aim at solving this problem by exploiting the spectrum holes (the spectrum not being used by primary radio nodes at a particular time) and allocating the spectrum dynamically. In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic channel assignment for cognitive radio users in multi-radio multichannel cognitive radio networks (MRMC-CRNs). We propose an efficient spectrum-aware dynamic channel assignment (SA-DCA) strategy for such networks. SA-DCA utilizes available channels and assigns them to multiple radio interfaces of cognitive radio nodes based on primary radio unoccupancy, minimum interference to primary radio nodes, maximum connectivity and minimum interference between cognitive radio nodes. We perform simulations in NS-2 and compare the performance of SA-DCA with two related strategies. Simulation results show that SA-DCA assigns channels efficiently and results in significantly reduced interference to primary radio nodes and increased packet delivery ratio in MRMC-CRNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172174","htmlLink":"/document/6375468/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-aware dynamic channel assignment in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-aware dynamic channel assignment in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET2012Camera335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054334S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362333","isNumber":"6375072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362333","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6375072","articleId":"6375468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375473,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The demonstration is done on a case study where WHR unit is not yet installed. Comparison of power generation is done utilizing different methodologies along with their results. The applied CDM methodology applied and resultant emission reductions are also shown. The conclusions are given for the best system that is suitable as per our limitations and operational conditions.

In this paper a similar constrained optimization problem is formulated. A fuzzy rule based system (FRBS) is designed and used for solution of the problem. The parameters being optimized for the system are forward error correction (FEC) code and modulation scheme. FRBS suggests how to change these parameters according to varying channel state information (CSI) on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel that throughput can be maximized. Multilevel codes, Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) are used as FEC and Modulation scheme respectively. Moreover, a modified iterative algorithm is used for decoding the multilevel codes. Significance of proposed scheme is shown by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2012.6375482","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362333/6375072/06375482.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2012.6375482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy rule base system aided rate enhancement scheme for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375482","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy rule base system aided rate enhancement scheme for OFDM systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375482/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172188","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375482/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy rule base system aided rate enhancement scheme for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET2012Camera421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050511S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362333","isNumber":"6375072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362333","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6375072","articleId":"6375482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6375484,"authors":[{"name":"Yasir Ali Khan","affiliation":["PAEC, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Yasir Ali","lastName":"Khan","id":"37679580300"},{"name":"Sufi Tabassum Gul","affiliation":["DCIS, Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sufi Tabassum","lastName":"Gul","id":"37596673900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4451-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4452-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4450-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6375484","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Filter banks","Complexity theory","Hardware","Estimation","Adders","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","performance evaluation","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity analysis","performance analysis","spectrum sensing techniques","cognitive radios","opportunistic spectrum access","filter bank spectrum estimation techniques","spectral estimation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defined Radio","Cognitive Radio","spectrum sensing","filter bank spectrum estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICET.2012.6375484","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362333/6375072/06375484.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2012.6375484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity and performance analysis of spectrum sensing techniques for Cognitive Radios","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a vital part of Cognitive Radios (CRs).

The total number of decoder iterations required to obtain reliable data depends upon the physical channel characteristics; the noise level and fading magnitude. Hence, it is important to develop some criteria to stop the decoding process once there are no further improvements in the extrinsic information in order to save the computational power and increase the decoding speed. In this paper, we have compared and analyzed the performance of several different existing stopping rules (Early Termination) for turbo decoder used for the Satellite Telemetry link. We have also proposed a modified early termination rule (MCDR) based on the combination of sum-reliability and min-reliability of extrinsic information which yields improved system performance.

Based on detailed RTL-level implementations, we evaluate representative allocator architectures in terms of matching quality, delay, area and power and investigate the sensitivity of these properties to key network parameters. We introduce a scheme for sparse VC allocation that limits transitions between groups of VCs based on the function they perform, and reduces the VC allocator's delay, area and power by up to 41%, 90% and 83%, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a pessimistic mechanism for speculative switch allocation that reduces switch allocator delay by up to 23% compared to a conventional implementation without increasing the router's zero-load latency. Finally, we quantify the effects of the various design choices discussed in the paper on overall network performance by presenting simulation results for two exemplary 64-node NoC topologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocator implementations for network-on-chip routers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654112","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Allocator implementations for network-on-chip routers","conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375518/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433689","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocator implementations for network-on-chip routers","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076974S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375521,"authors":[{"name":"Doe Hyun Yoon","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas at Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Doe Hyun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38243849300"},{"name":"Mattan Erez","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Texas at Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Mattan","lastName":"Erez","id":"37318863100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-744-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"6375521","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Random access memory","Error correction","System-on-chip","Redundancy","Servers","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","error correction","error detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible cache error protection","ECC FIFO","on-chip cache area","tier-2 correction","off-chip memory","error detection","tier-1 code","off-chip DRAM","cache line","ECC information","on-chip storage","strong tier-2 code","two-tiered last-level cache error protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error correction","last-level caches","reliability","soft error"]}],"abstract":"We present ECC FIFO, a mechanism enabling two-tiered last-level cache error protection using an arbitrarily strong tier-2 code without increasing on-chip storage. Instead of adding redundant ECC information to each cache line, our ECC FIFO mechanism off-loads the extra information to off-chip DRAM. We augment each cache line with a tier-1 code, which provides error detection consuming limited resources. The redundancy required for strong protection is provided by a tier-2 code placed in off-chip memory. Because errors that require tier-2 correction are rare, the overhead of accessing DRAM is unimportant. We show how this method can save 15-25% and 10-17% of on-chip cache area and power respectively while minimally impacting performance, which decreases by 1% on average across a range of scientific and consumer benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654109","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375521.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible cache error protection using an ECC FIFO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375521/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible cache error protection using an ECC FIFO","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375521/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible cache error protection using an ECC FIFO","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107306S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375524,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Petrini","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

The growing network rates, rapidly approaching 10 Gbits/sec, and the large number of signatures that need to be scanned concurrently pose very demanding challenges to algorithmic design and practical implementation. In this paper we present SCAMPI, a ground-breaking string searching algorithm that is fast, space-efficient, scalable and resilient to attacks. SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA. Using SCAMPI we have been able to scan an input stream using a dictionary of 3.5 millions keywords, more than an order of magnitude larger than any published result in the literature and in commercial prototypes, at a rate of more than 1.2 Gbits/sec per processing core.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/6375524/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433695","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SCAMPI: a scalable CAM-based algorithm for multiple pattern inspection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCAMPI: a scalable CAM-based algorithm for multiple pattern inspection","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054821S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375528,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Ho Ahn","affiliation":["HP Labs, USA"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673865600"},{"name":"Norman P.

Recently, there are proposals aiming at better main-memory energy efficiency by dividing a memory rank into subsets. We holistically assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting in the context of system-wide performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, then verify the analyses by simulating a chip-multiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM, one proposal embodying rank subsetting, for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches, it can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the cost of additional DRAM devices.","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654102","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375528.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future scaling of processor-memory interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Future scaling of processor-memory interfaces","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433699","htmlLink":"/document/6375528/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future scaling of processor-memory interfaces","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151909S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375530,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Lang","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Lang","id":"37577070400"},{"name":"Philip Carns","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Carns","id":"37422604200"},{"name":"Robert Latham","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Latham","id":"37561241000"},{"name":"Robert Ross","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ross","id":"37284984100"},{"name":"Kevin Harms","affiliation":["Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Harms","id":"37720198900"},{"name":"William Allcock","affiliation":["Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Allcock","id":"37282947000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-744-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"6375530","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IBM computers","parallel machines","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage system","file system","computational science application","supercomputer","Argonne Leadership Computing Facility","IBM Blue Gene/P system","Intrepid","I/O system","leadership-class system","I/O requirement","storage node","high performance computing system","leadership scale","I/O performance"]}],"abstract":"Today's top high performance computing systems run applications with hundreds of thousands of processes, contain hundreds of storage nodes, and must meet massive I/O requirements for capacity and performance.

The machine's specialized hardware dramatically increases the speed of MD calculations, making possible for the first time the simulation of biologicl molecules at an atomic level of detail for periods on the order of a millisecond---about two orders of magnitude beyond the previous state of the art. Anton is now running simulations on a timescale at which many critically important, but poorly understood phenomena are known to occur, allowing the observation of aspects of protein dynamics that were previously inaccessible to both computational and experimental study. Here, we report Anton's performance when executing actual MD simulations whose accuracy has been validated against both existing MD software and experimental observations. We also discuss the manner in which novel algorithms have been coordinated with Anton's co-designed, application-specific hardware to achieve these results.","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654099","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Anton","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Anton","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375531/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6375531/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Anton","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116678S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375540,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Nukada","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Nukada","id":"37392857200"},{"name":"Satoshi Matsuoka","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Japan","National Institute of Informatics","Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Matsuoka","id":"37270081500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-60558-744-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"6375540","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","graphics processing units","matrix multiplication","multi-threading","optimisation","parallel architectures","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU hardware","bandwidth intensive optimizations","complex kernels","bandwidth intensive kernels","stencils","DGEMM","dense kernels","transform sizes","performance CUDA kernels","CUDA GPU","auto-tuning 3D FFT library"]}],"abstract":"Existing implementations of FFTs on GPUs are optimized for specific transform sizes like powers of two, and exhibit unstable and peaky performance i.e., do not perform as well in other sizes that appear in practice. Our new auto-tuning 3-D FFT on CUDA generates high performance CUDA kernels for FFTs of varying transform sizes, alleviating this problem. Although auto-tuning has been implemented on GPUs for dense kernels such as DGEMM and stencils, this is the first instance that has been applied comprehensively to bandwidth intensive and complex kernels such as 3-D FFTs. Bandwidth intensive optimizations such as selecting the number of threads and inserting padding to avoid bank conflicts on shared memory are systematically applied. Our resulting autotuner is fast and results in performance that essentially beats all 3-D FFT implementations on a single processor to date, and moreover exhibits stable performance irrespective of problem sizes or the underlying GPU hardware.","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654090","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375540.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-tuning 3-D FFT library for CUDA GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Auto-tuning 3-D FFT library for CUDA GPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375540/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433710","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6375540/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-tuning 3-D FFT library for CUDA GPUs","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049759S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6375547,"authors":[{"name":"Rajagopal Ananthanarayanan","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajagopal","lastName":"Ananthanarayanan","id":"37683387100"},{"name":"Steven K.

The vortex particle simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the periodic FMM with 16,777,216 particles showed a sustained performance of 20.2 TFlops. The overall cost of the hardware was 228,912 dollars. The maximum corrected performance is 28.1TFlops for the gravitational simulation, which results in a cost performance of 124 MFlops/$.

Current hard disk drive (HDD) checkpointing results in overhead of 25% or more at the petascale. With a direct correlation between checkpoint frequencies and node counts, novel techniques that can take more frequent checkpoints with minimum overhead are critical to implement a reliable exascale system. In this work, we leverage the upcoming Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM) technology and propose a hybrid local/global checkpointing mechanism after a thorough analysis of MPP systems failure rates and failure sources. We propose three variants of PCRAM-based hybrid checkpointing schemes, DIMM+HDD, DIMM+DIMM, and 3D+3D, to reduce the checkpoint overhead and offer a smooth transition from the conventional pure HDD checkpoint to the ideal 3D PCRAM mechanism. The proposed pure 3D PCRAM-based mechanism can ultimately take checkpoints with overhead less than 4% on a projected exascale system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1654059.1654117","doi":"10.1145/1654059.1654117","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/5933718/6375513/06375553.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Computing Networking, Storage and Analysis","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging 3D PCRAM technologies to reduce checkpoint overhead for future exascale systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Leveraging 3D PCRAM technologies to reduce checkpoint overhead for future exascale systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"13433723","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6375553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging 3D PCRAM technologies to reduce checkpoint overhead for future exascale systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089747S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375555,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37421483200"},{"name":"Qingda Lu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Qingda","lastName":"Lu","id":"37874372200"},{"name":"Xiaoning Ding","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoning","lastName":"Ding","id":"37287408200"},{"name":"Zhao Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279632200"},{"name":"Xiaodong Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279334000"},{"name":"P.

In order to turn cache partitioning methods into reality in the management of multicore processors, we propose to provide an affordable and lightweight hardware support to coordinate with OS-based cache management policies. The proposed methods are scalable to many-cores, and perform comparably with other proposed hardware solutions, but have much lower overheads, therefore can be easily adopted in commodity processors. Having conducted extensive experiments with 37 multi-programming workloads, we show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods.

Platform-specific design and optimization is discussed in a mechanism-agnostic way, permitting the optimization of many chemical mechanisms. The implementation of a three-stage Rosenbrock solver for SIMD architectures is discussed. When used as a template mechanism in the the Kinetic PreProcessor, the multi-core implementation enables the automatic optimization and porting of many chemical mechanisms on a variety of multi-core platforms.

Linear algebra programs are written with the task-based library and executed by a dynamic runtime system. We mainly focus our runtime system design on the metric of performance scalability. We propose a distributed algorithm to solve data dependences without process cooperation. We have implemented the runtime system and applied it to three linear algebra algorithms: Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations.

In contrast to the uniform regularity of dense linear algebra, sparse operations encounter a broad spectrum of matrices ranging from the regular to the highly irregular. Harnessing the tremendous potential of throughput-oriented processors for sparse operations requires that we expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and impose sufficient regularity on execution paths and memory access patterns. We explore SpMV methods that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large percentages of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices, respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285.

In addition, Anton's general-purpose computation system incorporates primitives that support the efficient parallelization of small 1D FFTs.

Many applications insulate themselves from failures by checkpointing. For many applications, checkpointing into a shared single file is most convenient. With such an approach, the size of writes are often small and not aligned with file system boundaries. Unfortunately for these applications, this preferred data layout results in pathologically poor performance from the underlying file system which is optimized for large, aligned writes to non-shared files. To address this fundamental mismatch, we have developed a virtual parallel log structured file system, PLFS. PLFS remaps an application's preferred data layout into one which is optimized for the underlying file system. Through testing on PanFS, Lustre, and GPFS, we have seen that this layer of indirection and reorganization can reduce checkpoint time by an order of magnitude for several important benchmarks and real applications without any application modification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/6375580/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13433750","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"PLFS: a checkpoint filesystem for parallel applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLFS: a checkpoint filesystem for parallel applications","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"87440021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097239S","chronDate":"14-20 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5933718","isNumber":"6375513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5933718","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6375513","articleId":"6375580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375634,"authors":[{"name":"Wenke Zhang","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Wenke","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404211900"},{"name":"Favyen Bastani","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Favyen","lastName":"Bastani","id":"38528866500"},{"name":"I-Ling Yen","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"I-Ling","lastName":"Yen","id":"37284300800"},{"name":"Kevin Hulin","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Hulin","id":"38473975700"},{"name":"Farokh Bastani","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Bastani","id":"37284301500"},{"name":"Latifur Khan","affiliation":["University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Latifur","lastName":"Khan","id":"37267088800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4742-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4912-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2059"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2059"}],"articleNumber":"6375634","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"abstract":"For deployed systems, software fault detection can be challenging. Generally, faulty behaviors are detected based on execution logs, which may contain a large volume of execution traces, making analysis extremely difficult. This paper investigates and compares the effectiveness and efficiency of various data mining techniques for software fault detection based on execution logs, including clustering based, density based, and probabilistic automata based methods. However, some existing algorithms suffer from high complexity and do not scale well to large datasets. To address this problem, we present a suite of prefix tree based anomaly detection techniques. The prefix tree model serves as a compact loss less data representation of execution traces. Also, the prefix tree distance metric provides an effective heuristic to guide the search for execution traces having close proximity to each other. In the density based algorithm, the prefix tree distance is used to confine the K-nearest neighbor search to a small subset of the nodes, which greatly reduces the computing time without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental studies show a significant speedup in our prefix tree based and prefix tree distance guided approaches, from days to minutes in the best cases, in automated identification of software failures.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6374352/6375604/06375634.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","doi":"10.1109/HASE.2012.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2012.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Streams of Execution Traces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Automata","Probabilistic logic","Software algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern classification","pattern clustering","probabilistic automata","program diagnostics","software fault tolerance","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time anomaly detection","execution traces","software fault detection","execution logs","data mining techniques","probabilistic automata based methods","density based methods","high complexity","prefix tree based anomaly detection techniques","compact loss less data representation","prefix tree distance metric model","K-nearest neighbor search","software failures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","prefix tree","k-medoids clustering","local outlier factor","probabilistic automata"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Streams of Execution Traces","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13186874","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Streams of Execution Traces","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"4912a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074556S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6374352","isNumber":"6375604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6374352","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6375604","articleId":"6375634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6375700,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/6731355/6375700/6375700-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ke Zhai received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the Software College of Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

When the implementation of an LBS-enabled service has evolved, regression testing can be employed to assure the previously established behaviors not having been adversely affected. Proper test case prioritization helps reveal service anomalies efficiently so that fixes can be scheduled earlier to minimize the nuisance to service consumers. A key observation is that locations captured in the inputs and the expected outputs of test cases are physically correlated by the LBS-enabled service, and these services heuristically use estimated and imprecise locations for their computations, making these services tend to treat locations in close proximity homogenously. This paper exploits this observation. It proposes a suite of metrics and initializes them to demonstrate input-guided techniques and point-of-interest (POI) aware test case prioritization techniques, differing by whether the location information in the expected outputs of test cases is used. It reports a case study on a stateful LBS-enabled service. The case study shows that the POI-aware techniques can be more effective and more stable than the baseline, which reorders test cases randomly, and the input-guided techniques. We also find that one of the POI-aware techniques, cdist, is either the most effective or the second most effective technique among all the studied techniques in our evaluated aspects, although no technique excels in all studied SOA fault classes.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2012.40","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/6731355/06375700.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2012.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6731355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prioritizing Test Cases for Regression Testing of Location-Based Services: Metrics, Techniques, and Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Prioritizing Test Cases for Regression Testing of Location-Based Services: Metrics, Techniques, and Case Study","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14078131","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6375700/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prioritizing Test Cases for Regression Testing of Location-Based Services: Metrics, Techniques, and Case Study","sourcePdf":"tsc2014010054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095807S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6731355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6731355","articleId":"6375700","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6375706,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Yu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6810193/6375706/6375706-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongliang Yu received the doctor's degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006.

This paper proposes multi-way wear leveling (MWWL) to increase both endurance and security of PCM. MWWL can efficiently distribute writes to physical addresses uniformly from a multiple of ways while incurring little write overhead and almost no extra hardware overhead. More important, MWWL is a fundamental scheme that can be applied to existing leveling algorithms. As a case study, we extended a state-of-the-art technique, Security Refresh, to its multi-way version, Multi-Way Security Refresh (MWSR). The experimental results show that MWSR can achieve the same or better lifetime than that of the original two-level Security Refresh but with much less write overhead (from 11.7% down to 1.5%).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6810193/06375706.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TC.2012.292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2012.292","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing Endurance and Security of Phase-Change Memory with Multi-Way Wear-Leveling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375706/","displayDocTitle":"Increasing Endurance and Security of Phase-Change Memory with Multi-Way Wear-Leveling","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375706/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"14281616","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing Endurance and Security of Phase-Change Memory with Multi-Way Wear-Leveling","sourcePdf":"tc-yu-292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148754S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6810193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6810193","articleId":"6375706","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6375759,"authors":[{"name":"Wonbin Hong","affiliation":["Digital Media and Communications Research Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6493417/6375759/6375759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wonbin Hong (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Senior engineer at Samsung Electronics, DMC R&D Center, Suwon, South Korea.

To achieve that, we propose the use of two-dimensional antenna arrays as realizable launchers. Truncated Bessel beams with a main lobe width of few wavelengths (\u03bb) can propagate over several hundreds of \u03bb if the antenna aperture is electrically large. Because such a large aperture would require a large number of antenna elements, sub-sampling distributions are proposed in this work. It is found that arrays with spacings of approximately 4\u03bb generate high quality beams with very low amplitude oscillations over distances of about 300\u03bb in vacuum.

The synthesis method is scalar, but the pseudo-Bessel beams obtained are vectorial and linearly polarized.

The impact of the body on antenna performance is assessed for return loss, radiation patterns and antenna efficiency in a wide frequency range. Full three dimensional radiation patterns were measured with the antenna backed by a phantom in order to simulate a human body. While the return loss was found to be only marginally affected when the antenna was mounted at various positions on the human body, the measured efficiency was observed to decrease by up to 90% when the antenna was positioned flush to the phantom. The return loss response was little affected when the antenna was worn on the back and further covered with a number of garments including a thick woolen jumper and a ski jacket. Although antenna efficiency was substantially affected by the presence of the body, interposing a layer of felt fabric between the antenna and the phantom typically improved efficiency by over 50%.

This new technique reduces power consumption and die area by minimizing the number of active elements and simplifying the modulator topology. The new SAB network has a transfer function (TF) zero, which implements a local feedforward (FF) path in system-level diagram. By having a local FF branch embedded in the SAB network, the FF branches to the summing block in the SAB based feedforward modulator topology is reduced to half the number of FF branches in the conventional topology. Consequently, the SAB based modulator utilizes a switch-capacitor (SC) adder replacing the commonly used CT adder and the sample & hold blocks in the conventional architecture. The SAB based loop filter with reduced FF branches simplifies the design and implementation of the high-order continuous-time \u0394\u03a3 modulator.

The resulting transform approximates the underlying transform very well, while maintaining all the advantages and properties of WHT. The method is successfully applied for developing a binary discrete cosine transform (BDCT) and a binary discrete Hartley transform (BDHT). It is shown that the resulting BDCT corresponds to the well-known sequency-ordered WHT, whereas the BDHT can be considered as a new Hartley-ordered WHT. Specifically, the properties of the proposed Hartley-ordering are discussed and a shift-copy scheme is proposed for a simple and direct generation of the Hartley-ordering functions. For software and hardware implementation purposes, a unified structure for the computation of the WHT, BDCT, and BDHT is proposed by establishing an elegant relationship between the three transform matrices. In addition, a spiral-ordering is proposed to graphically obtain the BDHT from the BDCT and vice versa. The application of these binary transforms in image compression, encryption and spectral analysis clearly shows the ability of the BDCT (BDHT) in approximating the DCT (DHT) very well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375773/","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6375773/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13398266","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Binary Discrete Cosine and Hartley Transforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Discrete Cosine and Hartley Transforms","sourcePdf":"tcsi-swamy-2224751-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173537S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6486561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6486561","articleId":"6375773","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375779,"authors":[{"name":"Hazem Gomaa","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6631543/6375779/6375779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hazem Gomaa (S'12) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and communication engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2008, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Calgary.","His research interests include design and analysis of Web caching systems."]},"firstName":"Hazem","lastName":"Gomaa","id":"37682815900"},{"name":"Geoffrey G.

The cache may not reach the steady-state hit ratio when the number of Web objects, object popularity, and/or caching resources themselves are subject to change. Hence, the only way to quantify the hit ratio experienced by Web users is to calculate the instantaneous hit ratio. The proposed analysis considers a single Web cache with infinite or finite capacity. For a cache with finite capacity, two replacement policies are considered: Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO). Based on the insights from the proposed analytical model, we propose a new replacement policy, called Frequency-Based-FIFO (FB-FIFO). The results show that FB-FIFO outperforms both LRU and FIFO, assuming that the number of Web objects is fixed. Assuming that new popular objects are generated periodically, the results show that FB-FIFO adapts faster than LRU and FIFO to the changes in the popularity of the cached objects when the cache capacity is large relative to the number of newly generated objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375779/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13849643","volume":"21","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Instantaneous Cache Hit Ratio Using Markov Chain Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Instantaneous Cache Hit Ratio Using Markov Chain Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnet-gomaa-2227338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13166S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6631543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6631543","articleId":"6375779","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375780,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6631543/6375780/6375780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Ji (S'11\u2013M'12) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in information science and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at The Ohio State University, Columbus.","His research interests include resource allocation, optimization, cross-layer network control, and low-complexity scheduling algorithm design."]},"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ji","id":"37707806500"},{"name":"Changhee Joo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6631543/6375780/6375780-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Changhee Joo (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005.","He was with the Center of Wireless Systems and Applications, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, as an Associate Researcher and worked with The Ohio State University, Columbus, as a Research Scientist.

It is well known that scheduling schemes that favor links with larger queue length can achieve high throughput performance. However, these queue-length-based schemes could potentially suffer from large (even infinite) packet delays due to the well-known last packet problem, whereby packets belonging to some flows may be excessively delayed due to lack of subsequent packet arrivals. Delay-based schemes have the potential to resolve this last packet problem by scheduling the link based on the delay the packet has encountered. However, characterizing throughput optimality of these delay-based schemes has largely been an open problem in multihop wireless networks (except in limited cases where the traffic is single-hop.) In this paper, we investigate delay-based scheduling schemes for multihop traffic scenarios with fixed routes. We develop a scheduling scheme based on a new delay metric and show that the proposed scheme achieves optimal throughput performance.

Various capacitances thus obtained exhibit remarkable improvement over the planar top-gate device with multiple conducting channels.

For homogeneous soils with rough surfaces, the results of FEM are compared with the predictions of the small perturbation method. In the case of heterogeneous substrates, soil moisture (and, hence, soil permittivity) is assumed to vary as a function of depth. In this case, the results of FEM are compared with those of the transfer matrix method for flat soil surfaces. In both cases, a good agreement is found. For homogeneous rough soils, it is found that polarimetric radar backscatter and copolarized phase difference have a nonlinear relationship with soil moisture.

This work investigates the SCS bias sources and proposes a novel application of the EL approach to mitigate both SCS bias sources to produce two competitive maximum likelihood (ML) surrogate algorithms for DOA estimation. The DOA estimation performance and practical suitability of the proposed approaches are demonstrated via simulation. Simulations demonstrate that SCS with the EL-based bias mitigation is able to provide improved DOA estimation accuracy without the need for intensive regularization parameter tuning.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6451284/06375850.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2232654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2232654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Compressive Sensing for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Bias Mitigation Via Expected Likelihood","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Vectors","Arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation","Compressed sensing","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial compressive sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","expected likelihood","DOA estimation","expected likelihood approach","compressive sensing-based estimation approaches","discretization","azimuth bearing space","sparse signal recovery","maximum likelihood surrogate algorithms","EL-based bias mitigation","intensive regularization parameter tuning","regularized L1 optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA estimation","compressive sensing","expected likelihood","spatial compressive sensing","estimation bias","grid-bias"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Compressive Sensing for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Bias Mitigation Via Expected Likelihood","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6375850/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13306721","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Compressive Sensing for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Bias Mitigation Via Expected Likelihood","sourcePdf":"tsp-bilik-2232654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131019S","chronDate":"March1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6451284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6451284","articleId":"6375850","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375851,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Di Lorenzo","affiliation":["Department of Information, Electronics, and Telecommunications (DIET), Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6463483/6375851/6375851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Di Lorenzo (S'10\u2013M'13) received the M.Sc. degree in 2008 and the Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 2012, both from University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Italy.","He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Information, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome, \u201cLa Sapienza.\u201d During 2010, he held a visiting research appointment with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).

The approach relies on convex regularization, common in compressive sensing, to enhance the detection of sparsity via a diffusive process over the network. The resulting algorithms endow networks with learning abilities and allow them to learn the sparse structure from the incoming data in real-time, and also to track variations in the sparsity of the model. We provide convergence and mean-square performance analysis of the proposed method and show under what conditions it outperforms the unregularized diffusion version. We also show how to adaptively select the regularization parameter.

The overhead involved in providing the relay with the data prior to the transmission is often neglected. We demonstrate that the impact of relays can be even detrimental if the in-band signaling needs are not properly accounted for. Both precoder design and user allocation between the base station and the relay are considered. The precoder design objectives are transmit power minimization and throughput maximization each of which two different precoding approaches are considered. Zero-forcing precoder design is proposed to achieve reduced computation complexity and low signaling overhead. For higher efficiency and performance, we provide coordinated solutions, which allow more flexible interference control.

Previous studies were based on the assumption that the transmit powers of source nodes are the same and perfectly known which is not practical. In this paper, the source transmit powers are considered as nuisance parameters and estimated along with the source locations. The corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the problem is derived. To find the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, it is necessary to solve a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, which is computationally complex. To avoid the difficulty in solving the ML estimator, we derive a novel semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique by converting the ML minimization problem into a convex problem which can be solved efficiently. The algorithm requires only an estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE). We initially assume that perfect knowledge of the PLE is available, but we then examine the effect of imperfect knowledge of the PLE on the proposed SDP algorithm. The complexity analyses of the proposed algorithms are also studied in detail. Computer simulations showing the remarkable performance of the proposed SDP algorithm are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2232664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6463483/06375856.pdf","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2232664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Received Signal Strength-Based Sensor Localization With Unknown Transmit Powers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375856/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Received Signal Strength-Based Sensor Localization With Unknown Transmit Powers","volume":"61","issue":"6","publicationDate":"March15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13551633","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375856/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Received Signal Strength-Based Sensor Localization With Unknown Transmit Powers","sourcePdf":"tsp-monirvaghefi-2232664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124858S","chronDate":"March15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6463483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"6463483","articleId":"6375856","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6375858,"authors":[{"name":"Heidi Steendam","affiliation":["TELIN Department University, Ghent University-IBBT, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6451284/6375858/6375858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heidi Steendam (M'01\u2013SM'06) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in applied sciences from Ghent University, Gent, Belgium, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.","Since September 1995, she has been with the Digital Communications (DIGCOM) Research Group, Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing (TELIN), Faculty of Engineering, Ghent University, first in the framework of various research projects, and since October 2002, as a full-time Professor in the area of digital communications.

Huemer, C. Hofbauer, and J. B. Huber, \u201cThe Potential of Unique Words in OFDM, Proc. InOWo, Hamburg, Germany, Sep. 2010, pp. 140-144]. In this technique, the guard interval that contains a priori known samples is part of the FFT interval. To be able to construct the UW-OFDM signal, some carriers must be sacrificed to transmit redundant information-these carriers are called the redundant carriers. It turns out that the average redundant energy needed strongly depends on the positions of the redundant carriers. In this paper, we look for the redundant carrier placement that minimizes the average redundant energy. However, this optimization is a NP-hard problem. Therefore, we reformulate the optimization problem and implement a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm to find the optimum. The results of the B&B search algorithm are compared to a theoretical lower bound, and with the results for two low cost redundant carrier placements, i.e., the quasi-uniform (QU) distribution [H. Steendam, \u201cThe Quasi-Uniform Redundant Carrier Placement for UW-OFDM,\u201d Vehicular Technology Conf., Fall 2012, Quebec, Canada, Sep. 2012], for the case where no guard bands are present, and the maximum distance (MD) distribution, in case forbidden guard bands are present. We show in this paper that when the full band is available for redundant carriers, both the redundant carrier placement found with the B&B algorithm and the QU distribution result in a redundant energy that is very close to the theoretical lower bound. Although the B&B slightly outperforms the QU distribution, this implies that the QU distribution is a good low cost solution to the redundant carrier placement problem in the case of no guard bands. However, when there are forbidden guard bands in which the redundant carriers cannot be placed, the QU distribution can no longer be used. In that case, the results of the B&B algorithm are compared to that of the MD distribution. We show in this paper that the proposed B&B algorithm outperforms the MD distribution in the sense that it needs noticeably lower redundant energy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Selection of the Redundant Carrier Positions in UW-OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2232657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6451284/06375858.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2232657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Selection of the Redundant Carrier Positions in UW-OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6375858/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2013","publicationDate":"March1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13306725","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Selection of the Redundant Carrier Positions in UW-OFDM","sourcePdf":"tsp-steendam-2232657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090431S","chronDate":"March1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6451284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6451284","articleId":"6375858","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6375894,"authors":[{"name":"Adlen Ksentini","affiliation":["University of Rennes I, France"],"bio":{"p":["Adlen Ksentini (Adlen.Ksentini@irisa.fr) is an associate professor at the University of Rennes 1, France.

Congestion concerns all the parts of the network, both the radio and the core network impacting both the user data plane and the control plane.

We propose a congestion-aware admission control solution that selectively rejects signaling messages from MTC devices at the radio access network following a probability that is set based on a proportional integrative derivative controller reflecting the congestion level of a relevant core network node. We evaluate the performance of our proposed solution using computer simulations. The obtained results are encouraging.

Both ITU-T and IEEE standardized PONs are considered.

Then, the article provides answers to major questions, such as where, when, and how to reduce PON energy consumption in TDM PONs by means of a quantitative evaluation. Results show that to reduce energy consumption, ONUs must be provided with physical devices that are not only power-efficient but also provide improved services (e.g., fast synchronization) to upper layers.

Network virtualization is being adopted in both telecommunications and the Internet as a key attribute for the next generation networking. Virtualization, as a potential enabler of profound changes in both communications and computing domains, is expected to bridge the gap between these two fields. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), when applied in network virtualization, enables a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm that may greatly facilitate the convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Recently the application of SOA in network virtualization has attracted extensive interest from both academia and industry. Although numerous relevant research works have been published, they are currently scattered across multiple fields in the literature, including telecommunications, computer networking, Web services, and Cloud computing. In this article we present a comprehensive survey on the latest developments in service-oriented network virtualization for supporting Cloud computing, particularly from a perspective of network and Cloud convergence through NaaS. Specifically, we first introduce the SOA principle and review recent research progress on applying SOA to support network virtualization in both telecommunications and the Internet. Then we present a framework of network-Cloud convergence based on service-oriented network virtualization and give a survey on key technologies for realizing NaaS, mainly focusing on state of the art of network service description, discovery, and composition. We also discuss the challenges brought in by network-Cloud convergence to these technologies and research opportunities available in these areas, with a hope to arouse the research community's interest in this emerging interdisciplinary field.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/6375899/06375901.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Service-Oriented Network Virtualization Toward Convergence of Networking and Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2012.113012.120310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2012.113012.120310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Service-Oriented Network Virtualization Toward Convergence of Networking and Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13167782","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6375901/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Service-Oriented Network Virtualization Toward Convergence of Networking and Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"373-tnsm1212-duan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164503S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6375899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"6375899","articleId":"6375901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6375933,"authors":[{"name":"Ondrej Hlinka","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Ondrej Hlinka (oHlinka@nt.tuwien.ac.at) received the Ing.

The proposed framework is used to arrive at new insights and methods, both practical and theoretical. In particular, several novel optimality properties of algorithms in wide use such as block-matching and three-dimensional (3-D) filtering (BM3D), and methods for their iterative improvement (or nonexistence thereof) are discussed. A general approach is laid out to enable the performance analysis and subsequent improvement of many existing filtering algorithms. While much of the material discussed is applicable to the wider class of linear degradation models beyond noise (e.g., blur,) to keep matters focused, we consider the problem of denoising here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","volume":"30","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13168062","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6375938/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Tour of Modern Image Filtering: New Insights and Methods, Both Practical and Theoretical","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tour of Modern Image Filtering: New Insights and Methods, Both Practical and Theoretical","sourcePdf":"30msp01-milanfar-2179329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141538S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6375903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"364","xplore-issue":"6375903","articleId":"6375938","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6375940,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Fredrik Rusek (fredrik.Rusek@eit.lth.se) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Lund University, Sweden, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.

For example, the LTE standard allows for up to eight antenna ports at the base station. Basically, the more antennas the transmitter/receiver is equipped with, and the more degrees of freedom that the propagation channel can provide, the better the performance in terms of data rate or link reliability. More precisely, on a quasi static channel where a code word spans across only one time and frequency coherence interval, the reliability of a point-to-point MIMO link scales according to Prob(link outage) ` SNR-ntnr where nt and nr are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, and signal-to-noise ratio is denoted by SNR. On a channel that varies rapidly as a function of time and frequency, and where circumstances permit coding across many channel coherence intervals, the achievable rate scales as min(nt, nr) log(1 + SNR). The gains in multiuser systems are even more impressive, because such systems offer the possibility to transmit simultaneously to several users and the flexibility to select what users to schedule for reception at any given point in time [2].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","volume":"30","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13168064","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6375940/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scaling Up MIMO: Opportunities and Challenges with Very Large Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling Up MIMO: Opportunities and Challenges with Very Large Arrays","sourcePdf":"30msp01-rusek-2178495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114464S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6375903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"3498","xplore-issue":"6375903","articleId":"6375940","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6375943,"authors":[{"name":"Jens-Rainer Ohm","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Jens-Rainer Ohm (ohm@ient.rwth-aachen.de) holds the chair position at the Institute of Communication Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, Germany."]},"firstName":"Jens-Rainer","lastName":"Ohm","id":"37283153200"},{"name":"Gary J.

The HEVC project was launched to achieve major savings-e.g., reduction by about half for 1,280 \u00d7 720 high-definition (HD) and higher-resolution progressives can video-for equivalent visual quality relative to the bit rate needed by the widely used H.264/ MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) standard. For high resolution video where such additional compression is most urgently required, implementations of the current draft standard are already meeting or exceeding the targeted goal. We review the architecture and building blocks of HEVC, which were carefully selected with regard to compression capability versus complexity and to enable parallelism for the signal processing operations. Given the benefits that HEVC provides, it is likely to become the new primary reference for video compression.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2219672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/6375903/06375943.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2219672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6375903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High efficiency video coding: the next frontier in video compression [Standards in a Nutshell]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6375943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6375943/","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency video coding: the next frontier in video compression [Standards in a Nutshell]","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13168067","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6375943/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency video coding: the next frontier in video compression [Standards in a Nutshell]","sourcePdf":"30msp01-standards-2219672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055812S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6375903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6375903","articleId":"6375943","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6376044,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ismail","affiliation":["Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38183398200"},{"name":"Justin Coon","affiliation":["Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Coon","id":"37268288300"},{"name":"Imran Ahmed","affiliation":["Toshiba Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37404300800"},{"name":"Simon Armour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Armour","id":"37271546200"},{"name":"Joseph McGeehan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"McGeehan","id":"37272727900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6376044","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376044","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Bit error rate","Linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","bit flipping","decoder","high throughput"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel bit flipping algorithm for high-throughput decoding of LDPC codes.

The proposed algorithm firstly compensates the channel attenuation and obtains the estimated symbols with transmit antenna indices, then orders the indices based on the distances between these symbols and their demodulation constellations. A searching method is developed to obtain the final decision through a trade-off between performance and complexity. The equivalence between DBD and ML algorithms is also proved by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, a new low-complexity soft output DBD (SODBD) algorithm is developed for coded SM systems. The simulation results show that DBD algorithm has a close performance to ML algorithm while effectively reducing the complexity compared to conventional near-ML algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Low-Complexity Near-ML Detection Algorithm for Spatial Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.120312.120601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6473805/06376045.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.120312.120601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","displayDocTitle":"A New Low-Complexity Near-ML Detection Algorithm for Spatial Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6376045/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"February 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Low-Complexity Near-ML Detection Algorithm for Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"090-wcl1302-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057881S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6473805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6473805","articleId":"6376045","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376046,"authors":[{"name":"Kaijie Zhou","affiliation":["EURECOM, Biot, France"],"firstName":"Kaijie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38264998100"},{"name":"Navid Nikaein","affiliation":["EURECOM, Biot, France"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Nikaein","id":"37948081600"},{"name":"Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos","affiliation":["EURECOM, Biot, France"],"firstName":"Thrasyvoulos","lastName":"Spyropoulos","id":"37266416400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6376046","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Delay","3G mobile communication","Mathematical model","Probability","Wireless communication","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","DRX","MTC","semi-Markov model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376046","abstract":"Machine type communications (MTC) are considered as key applications in LTE/LTE-A networks, for which lowering power consumption is among the primary requirements.

Relaying systems can comprise many hops but the most practical approach for the time being would be a dual-hop system. In addition, the simplest method of relaying in terms of transceiver complexity is amplify and forward. In this context, we investigate the MMSE filtering performance of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward channel MIMO multiple-access channel and we propose a tight lower bound for the average MMSE based on the principles of free probability theory. The accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and the effect of the normalized system parameters, such as first/second hop power/load, are evaluated through numerical results. It is established that the performance of MMSE receiver greatly depends on the first hop power, while increasing the second hop power marginally improves the performance. Furthermore, inequality conditions are expressed for first/second hop load in order to achieve low average MMSE.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2012.120312.120831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962382/6473805/06376052.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2012.120312.120831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE Filtering Performance of Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Access Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376052/","displayDocTitle":"MMSE Filtering Performance of Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Access Channels","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376052/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Filtering Performance of Dual-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Multiple-Access Channels","sourcePdf":"122-wcl1302-chatz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070668S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6473805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6473805","articleId":"6376052","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376075,"authors":[{"name":"George T.

In this communication we take advantage of the wavelength properties of optical signals to present new architectural perspectives in optical RAM structures by introducing the WDM principles in the storage area. To this end, we report on a 4 \u00d7 4 WDM optical RAM bank architecture that exploits a novel SOA-based multi-wavelength Access Gate (WDM-AG) and a dual wavelength SOA-based SET-RESET All-Optical Flip Flop (AOFF) as fundamental building blocks. The WDM-AG enables simultaneous random access to a 4-bit optical word encoded in 8 different wavelengths, allowing for the four AOFFs of each RAM row to effectively share the same Access Gate. The scheme is shown to support a 10 Gbit/s operation for the incoming 4-bit data streams, with a power consumption of 15 mW/Gbit/s for the WDM-AG and 120 mW/Gbit/s for the AOFFs. The proposed optical RAM architecture reveals that exploiting the WDM capabilities of optical components can lead to RAM bank implementations with smarter column/row encoders/decoders, increased circuit simplicity, reduced number of active elements and associated power consumption, while enabling for re-configurability in optical cache mapping.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2232903","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6415271/06376075.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2232903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bringing WDM Into Optical Static RAM Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"Bringing WDM Into Optical Static RAM Architectures","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376075/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2013","publicationDate":"March15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13283660","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bringing WDM Into Optical Static RAM Architectures","sourcePdf":"jlt-alexoudi-2232903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108046S","chronDate":"March15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6415271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6415271","articleId":"6376075","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376076,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Long Chin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Wen-Long Chin received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008.","In February 2009, he joined National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, as an Assistant Professor.

However, the phased-MIMO radar is limited to range-independent directivity; this limits the radar performance to mitigate non-desirable range-dependent interferences. In this paper, we propose a new phased-MIMO radar with frequency diversity for range-dependent beamforming. The essence of the proposed technique is to divide the frequency diverse array transmit array into multiple subarrays, each subarray coherently transmits a distinct waveform with a small frequency increment across the array elements. Each subarray forms a directional beam and all beams are independently steerable by tuning the frequency increment. The subarrays jointly offer flexible operating modes and range-dependent beamforming. The beamforming performance as compared to phased-MIMO radar is examined by analyzing the transmit-receive beampatterns and the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified by numerical simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased-MIMO Radar With Frequency Diversity for Range-Dependent Beamforming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2232909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6451196/06376087.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2232909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6451196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Phased-MIMO Radar With Frequency Diversity for Range-Dependent Beamforming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376087/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13387095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased-MIMO Radar With Frequency Diversity for Range-Dependent Beamforming","sourcePdf":"jsen-wang-2232909-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083006S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6451196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6451196","articleId":"6376087","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376091,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Mardani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Digital Technology Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6416927/6376091/6376091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Morteza Mardani (S\u201906) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2009.

As a means of maintaining seamless end-user experience in dynamic environments, as well as for ensuring network security, this paper deals with a crucial network monitoring task termed dynamic anomalography. Given link traffic measurements (noisy superpositions of unobserved OD flows) periodically acquired by backbone routers, the goal is to construct an estimated map of anomalies in real time, and thus summarize the network `health state' along both the flow and time dimensions. Leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies, a novel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted least-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm of the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic matrix. After recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to online optimization, a real-time algorithm for dynamic anomalography is developed and its convergence established under simplifying technical assumptions. For operational conditions where computational complexity reductions are at a premium, a lightweight stochastic gradient algorithm based on Nesterov's acceleration technique is developed as well. Comprehensive numerical tests with both synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithms and their tracking capabilities, and demonstrate that they outperform state-of-the-art approaches developed to diagnose traffic anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6416927/06376091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6416927","startPage":"50","endPage":"66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Anomalography: Tracking Network Anomalies Via Sparsity and Low Rank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Anomalography: Tracking Network Anomalies Via Sparsity and Low Rank","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13250290","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6376091/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Anomalography: Tracking Network Anomalies Via Sparsity and Low Rank","sourcePdf":"jstsp-giannakis-2233193-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122503S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6416927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6416927","articleId":"6376091","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376096,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Helmi Azhar","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Ahmad Helmi","lastName":"Azhar","id":"37849495800"},{"name":"Tuan-Anh Tran","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Tuan-Anh","lastName":"Tran","id":"37849193200"},{"name":"Dominic O'Brien","affiliation":["University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, GB"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"O'Brien","id":"37408550500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6376096","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":338,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Bit error rate","OFDM","Lighting","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","indoor communication","light emitting diodes","MIMO communication","modulation","OFDM modulation","optical communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gigabits indoor wireless transmission","MIMO-OFDM visible-light communications","indoor wireless visible-light communication transmission","four-channel multiple-input multiple-output link","LED sources","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation","nine-channel imaging diversity receiver","bit error rate","room illumination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","MIMO-OFDM","OFDM","visible-light communications"]}],"abstract":"This letter reports an experimental demonstration of indoor wireless visible-light communication transmission at 1 Gb/s.

O. Schmidt, IEEE Trans. Antennas and Propagation, vol. AP-34, no. 3, pp. 276-280, Mar. 1986) spectrum, here considered from the point of view of estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of narrowband signals. It can be used, with any smart antenna geometry and for any purpose where MUSIC is applicable. The MUSIC algorithm for DOA estimation evaluates the MUSIC spectrum for various angles and chooses the maxima or peaks as the angles of arrival. The values obtained depend on the interval at which the spectrum is evaluated. The coarser the interval, the less accurate are the results in case of MUSIC. To improve accuracy and not depend on the interval, Root-MUSIC (\u201cDirection finding for diversely polarized signals using polynomial rooting,\u201d A. J. Weiss and B. Friedlander, IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, vol. 41, no. 5, pp. 1893-1905, May 1993), which involves finding the roots of a polynomial, is available. However, Root-MUSIC is applicable, in its original form, only to uniform linear arrays (ULA). The gold-MUSIC algorithm proposed in this paper is a two-stage process. The first stage evaluates the objective function at coarse intervals and determines peaks followed by an iterative approach based on gold-section univariate (GSU) minimization (Algorithms for Minimization Without Derivatives, R. Brent, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA: Prentice-Hall, 1983) to find accurate values of the peaks. If the number of peaks found so far is equal to the number of estimated peaks, the algorithm stops with this first stage. The second stage is an iterative step for fine resolution using finer intervals around the peaks found so far for finding peaks that were missing in previous iterations. This paper, also presents a method, based on a partitioning algorithm for estimating the number of emitters. The performance of gold-MUSIC is described, including its advantages and comparison of time complexities for MUSIC, Root-MUSIC and gold-MUSIC. The proposed algorithm gives good results even when the number of snapshots is small. This gives it an additional computational advantage. It does not compromise on the resolving power of MUSIC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413060","htmlLink":"/document/6376104/","displayDocTitle":"gold-MUSIC: A Variation on MUSIC to Accurately Determine Peaks of the Spectrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"gold-MUSIC: A Variation on MUSIC to Accurately Determine Peaks of the Spectrum","sourcePdf":"tap-kaluri-2232893-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057669S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6493420","articleId":"6376104","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6376108,"authors":[{"name":"W.

As the memory bit-cell area is reduced, single event upsets (SEUs) that would have once corrupted only a single bit-cell are now capable of upsetting multiple adjacent memory bit-cells per particle strike. While these error types are beyond the error handling capabilities of the commonly used single error correction double error detection (SEC-DED) error correction codes (ECCs) in embedded memories, the overhead associated with moving to more sophisticated double error correction (DEC) codes is considered to be too costly. To address this, designers have begun leveraging selective bit placement to design SEC-DED codes capable of double adjacent error correction (DAEC) or triple adjacent error detection (TAED). These codes can be implemented for the same check-bit overhead as the conventional SEC-DED codes; however, no codes have been developed that use both DAEC and TAED together. In this paper, a new ECC scheme is introduced that provides not only the basic SEC-DED coverage but also both DAEC and scalable adjacent error detection ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i>\nAED) with a reduction in miscorrection probability as well. Codes capable of up to 11-bit AED have been developed for both 16- and 32-bit standard memory word sizes, and a (39, 32) SEC-DED-DAEC-TAED code implementation that uses the same number of check-bits as a conventional 32-data-bit SEC-DED code is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power,

The diff-amp array is composed of a common ND emitter array integrated with partition gates and split anodes. An identical pair of ND-VFETs with well-matched field emission transistor characteristics was fabricated by using a dual-mask well-controlled microfabrication process, involving a mold-transfer self-aligned gate-emitter technique in conjunction with ND deposition into the micropatterned molds in the active layer of a silicon-on-insulator substrate followed by gate partitioning to form diff-amp array. The ND-VFETs show gate-controlled modulation of emission with distinct cutoff, linear, and saturation regions. Signal amplification characteristics of the ND-VFET diff-amp are presented. A large common-mode-rejection ratio (CMRR) of 54.6 dB was measured for the diff-amp. The variation of CMRR performance with transconductance was examined, and the results were found to agree with the equivalent circuit model analysis. The accomplishment of this basic circuit building block, consisting of an integrated diff-amp, demonstrates the feasibility of using vacuum integrated circuits for practical applications, including high-radiation and temperature-tolerant space electronics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6376155/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13187786","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nanodiamond Vacuum Field Emission Integrated Differential Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanodiamond Vacuum Field Emission Integrated Differential Amplifier","sourcePdf":"ted-kang-2228485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063947S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6387647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6387647","articleId":"6376155","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6376160,"authors":[{"name":"Mengqi Hu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6613564/6376160/6376160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mengqi Hu received the Ph.D. degree in industrial engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, in 2012.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville.

Most recently, an intelligent augmented particle swarm optimization with multiple adaptive methods (PSO-MAM) was proposed and was demonstrated to be effective for diverse functions. However, inherited from PSO, the performance of PSO-MAM heavily depends on the settings of three parameters: the two learning factors and the inertia weight. In this paper, we propose a parameter control mechanism to adaptively change the parameters and thus improve the robustness of PSO-MAM. A new method, adaptive PSO-MAM (APSO-MAM) is developed that is expected to be more robust than PSO-MAM. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of APSO-MAM by comparing it with PSO-MAM and several state-of-the-art PSO algorithms and evolutionary algorithms. The proposed parameter control method is also compared with several existing parameter control methods. The experimental results demonstrate that APSO-MAM outperforms the compared PSO algorithms and evolutionary algorithms, and is more robust than PSO-MAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796231","htmlLink":"/document/6376160/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization With Multiple Adaptive Methods","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization With Multiple Adaptive Methods","sourcePdf":"tevc-hu-2232931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208555S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6613564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6613564","articleId":"6376160","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376176,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Comaniciu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6401192/6376176/6376176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristina Comaniciu received the M.S. degree in electronics from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Rutgers University in 2002.","From 2002 to 2003, she was a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University.

Remarkable accuracy and fast dynamic response are its main characteristics. However, this technique is computationally demanding compared to classic control schemes. This is particularly true in multilevel converters, where several variables of the system such as currents, switching frequency and neutral-point voltage balancing, to name a few, are controlled simultaneously. An important issue is to reduce the delay between the variable sampling and the instant at which the switching state is applied to the converter. Although DSP-based implementations have been proven to be an effective solution, the parallel nature of predictive controllers better fits with the architecture of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. This paper presents a new approach to the FPGA-based implementation of a predictive current controller for a multilevel converter. This approach also aims to reduce the average switching frequency and obtain neutral-point voltage balancing. The switching state is applied in the same sampling period in which the controlled variables are measured thereby enhancing the dynamic response of the system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inverters","Vectors","Cost function","Load modeling","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","predictive control","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","switching state","neutral-point voltage balancing","average switching frequency","predictive current controller","FPGA devices","field-programmable gate array","variable sampling","multilevel converters","power converters","current control strategies","predictive control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation","multilevel converters","neutral-point clamped inverters","predictive control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376179","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2232300","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6582568/06376179.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2232300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376179/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Implementation of a Predictive Current Controller for Power Converters","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","volume":"9","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13706459","htmlLink":"/document/6376179/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Implementation of a Predictive Current Controller for Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tii-martinsanchez-2232300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118517S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6582568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6582568","articleId":"6376179","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376180,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Nozaki","affiliation":["Ohnishi Laboratory, Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6631519/6376180/6376180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takahiro Nozaki (S'11) received the B.E. degree in system design engineering and the M.E. degrees in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

Compared with cloud computing, the services that are managed in CMfg include not only computational and software resource and capability service, but also various manufacturing resources and capability service. These various dynamic services make ES more powerful and to be a higher-level extension of traditional services. Thus, as a key issue for the implementation of CMfg-based ES, service composition optimal-selection (SCOS) is becoming very important. SCOS is a typical NP-hard problem with the characteristics of dynamic and uncertainty. Solving large scale SCOS problem with numerous constraints in CMfg by using the traditional methods might be inefficient. To overcome this shortcoming, the formulation of SCOS in CMfg with multiple objectives and constraints is investigated first, and then a novel parallel intelligent algorithm, namely full connection based parallel adaptive chaos optimization with reflex migration (FC-PACO-RM) is developed. In the algorithm, roulette wheel selection and adaptive chaos optimization are introduced for search purpose, while full-connection parallelization in island model and new reflex migration way are also developed for efficient decision. To validate the performance of FC-PACO-RM, comparisons with 3 serial algorithms and 7 typical parallel methods are conducted in three typical cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for addressing complex SCOS in CMfg.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","startPage":"2023","endPage":"2033","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2232936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2232936","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6631519/06376181.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FC-PACO-RM: A Parallel Method for Service Composition Optimal-Selection in Cloud Manufacturing System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376181/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"FC-PACO-RM: A Parallel Method for Service Composition Optimal-Selection in Cloud Manufacturing System","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843478","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376181/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FC-PACO-RM: A Parallel Method for Service Composition Optimal-Selection in Cloud Manufacturing System","sourcePdf":"tii-tao-2232936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094286S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6631519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"6631519","articleId":"6376181","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376183,"authors":[{"name":"Kobi Cohen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, RamatGan, Israel"],"firstName":"Kobi","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37602911500"},{"name":"Amir Leshem","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, RamatGan, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Leshem","id":"37284802600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6376183","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Detectors","Error probability","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","Markov processes","multi-access systems","statistical testing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["likelihood-based multiple access performance analysis","wireless sensor networks","binary hypothesis testing problem","local log-likelihood ratio","LLR","fusion center","multiple-access fading channels","wireless medium","sensor transmission superposition","identical channels","centralized error exponent","Chernoff bounding techniques","error probability","spatially correlated Markovian fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chernoff bound","Gartner\u2013Ellis theorem","Hoeffding bound","large deviations","multiple-access channel (MAC)","signal detection","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Likelihood-Based Multiple Access for Detection Over Fading Channels","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2232348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479338","endPage":"2481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6479338/06376183.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2232348","startPage":"2471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376183","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the binary hypothesis testing problem using wireless sensor networks. We analyze the case where sensors transmit their local log-likelihood ratio (LLR) directly to a fusion center (FC) using an analog transmission scheme over multiple-access fading channels. Due to the nature of the wireless medium, the FC receives a superposition of sensor transmissions. The decision is made by the FC and is based on received data from the sensors. In contrast to the case of identical channels and i.i.d observations, the analog transmission of the LLR over multiple-access fading channels does not achieve the centralized error exponent. Large deviation tools are used in this paper to characterize the error exponent in the asymptotic regime (when the number of sensors approaches infinity) in the case of non-i.i.d observations and non-i.i.d fading channels. Chernoff bounding techniques are used to provide bounds on the error probability for a finite number of sensors when the observations and the fading channels are independent across sensors. Specific performance analysis is provided for detection over both i.i.d and spatially correlated Markovian fading channels. Simulation results then illustrate the detector's performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13371600","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Likelihood-Based Multiple Access for Detection Over Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Likelihood-Based Multiple Access for Detection Over Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-cohen-2232348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051035S","chronDate":"April  2013","isNumber":"6479338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","articleId":"6376183","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376184,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Kaibin Huang (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.

Existing studies on MCC performance typically rely on either oversimplified Wyner-type models or complex system-level simulations. The promising theoretical results (typically using Wyner models) seem to materialize neither in complex simulations nor in practice. To more accurately investigate the theoretical performance of MCC, this paper models an entire plane of interfering cells as a Poisson random tessellation. The base stations (BSs) are then clustered using a regular lattice, whereby BSs in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by beamforming with perfect channel state information.

The LMPIT is the optimal test for the case of close hypotheses, among those satisfying the invariances of the problem, and in practical scenarios can provide better performance than the typically used generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The derivation of the LMPIT usually requires one to find the maximal invariant statistic for the detection problem and then derive its distribution under both hypotheses, which in general is a rather involved procedure. As an alternative, Wijsman's theorem provides the ratio of the maximal invariant densities without even finding an explicit expression for the maximal invariant. We first consider the problem of testing whether a set of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n-dimensional Gaussian random vectors are uncorrelated or not, and show that the LMPIT is given by the Frobenius norm of the sample coherence matrix. Second, we study the case in which the vectors under the null hypothesis are uncorrelated and identically distributed, that is, the sphericity test for Gaussian vectors, for which we show that the LMPIT is given by the Frobenius norm of a normalized version of the sample covariance matrix. Finally, some numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed tests, which provide better results than their GLRT counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2232705","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6479338/06376186.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2232705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"2128","endPage":"2141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally Most Powerful Invariant Tests for Correlation and Sphericity of Gaussian Vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Locally Most Powerful Invariant Tests for Correlation and Sphericity of Gaussian Vectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376186/","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376186/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13371602","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Most Powerful Invariant Tests for Correlation and Sphericity of Gaussian Vectors","sourcePdf":"tit-ramirez-2232705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098595S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6479338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6479338","articleId":"6376186","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6376187,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"},{"name":"Dmitri Truhachev","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Truhachev","id":"37284375300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6376187","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Demodulation in a random multiple access channel is considered where the signals are chosen uniformly randomly with unit energy. It is shown that by lifting (replicating) the graph of this system and randomizing the graph connections, a simple iterative cancellation demodulator achieves the same performance as an optimal symbol-by-symbol detector of the original system. The iterative detector has a complexity that is linear in the number of users, while the direct optimal approach is known to be NP-hard. However, the maximal system load of this lifted graph is limited to \u03b1 <; 2.07, even for large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-the system is interference limited. Spatial coupling between subsequent lifted graphs is introduced, and anchoring the initial graphs, the achievable system load \u03b1 can go to infinity as the SNR goes to infinity.

It is inexpensive to increase the sampling rate along the paths of the sensors but more expensive to increase the total distance traveled by the sensors per unit area, which we call the path density. In this paper, we introduce the problem of designing sensor trajectories that are minimal in path density subject to the condition that the measurements of the field on these trajectories admit perfect reconstruction of bandlimited fields. We study various possible designs of sampling trajectories. Generalizing some ideas from the classical theory of sampling on lattices, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the trajectories for perfect reconstruction. We show that a single set of equispaced parallel lines has the lowest path density from certain restricted classes of trajectories that admit perfect reconstruction. We then generalize some of our results to higher dimensions. We first obtain results on designing sampling trajectories in higher dimensional fields.

Commercial stakeholders of multimedia stream processing (MSP) applications, such as information retrieval, stream mining systems, and high-throughput image and video processing systems already feel the strain of inadequate system-level scaling and robustness under the always-increasing user demand. While such applications can tolerate certain imprecision in their results, today's MSP systems do not support a systematic way to exploit this aspect for cross-layer system resilience. However, research is currently emerging that attempts to utilize the error-tolerant nature of MSP applications for this purpose. This is achieved by modifications to all layers of the system stack, from algorithms and software to the architecture and device layer, and even the IC digital logic synthesis itself. Unlike conventional processing that aims for worst-case performance and accuracy guarantees, error-tolerant MSP attempts to provide guarantees for the expected performance and accuracy. In this paper we review recent advances in this field from an MSP and a system (layer-by-layer) perspective, and attempt to foresee some of the components of future cross-layer error-tolerant system design that may influence the multimedia and the general computing landscape within the next ten years.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2012.2232649","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6412815/06376226.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6412815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2012.2232649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","startPage":"291","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Tolerant Multimedia Stream Processing: There's Plenty of Room at the Top (of the System Stack)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Error Tolerant Multimedia Stream Processing: There's Plenty of Room at the Top (of the System Stack)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376226/","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6376226/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13234899","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Tolerant Multimedia Stream Processing: There's Plenty of Room at the Top (of the System Stack)","sourcePdf":"tmm-andreopoulos-2232649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169958S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6412815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6412815","articleId":"6376226","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376228,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Ho Moon","affiliation":["Department of Informatics/Engineering Research Institute, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Gyeongsangnam, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6479341/6376228/6376228-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Ho Moon received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Pusan National University, Pusan, Korea, in 1992, 1994, and 1998, respectively.

Through analysis of the ME process performed in the enhancement layer, we discovered that there are redundant MEs and some MEs can simply be unified at the fully overlapped search range (FOSR). In order to make the unified ME more efficient, we theoretically derive a skip criterion to determine whether the computation of rate-distortion cost can be omitted. In the proposed algorithm, the unnecessary MEs are removed and a unified ME with the skip criterion is applied in the FOSR. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves computational savings of approximately 46% without coding performance degradation when compared with the original SVC encoder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Fast Encoding Algorithm Based on an Efficient Motion Estimation Process for the Scalable Video Coding Standard","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2012.2232648","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6479341/06376228.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2012.2232648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6479341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"A New Fast Encoding Algorithm Based on an Efficient Motion Estimation Process for the Scalable Video Coding Standard","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6376228/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13382537","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Fast Encoding Algorithm Based on an Efficient Motion Estimation Process for the Scalable Video Coding Standard","sourcePdf":"tmm-moon-2232648-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069403S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6479341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6479341","articleId":"6376228","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376229,"authors":[{"name":"John Sartori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6412815/6376229/6376229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["John Sartori (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, computer science, and mathematics from the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, in 2006, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","Dr. Sartori recently joined the Faculty at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

In this paper, we exploit the observation that many GPU applications exhibit error tolerance to propose branch and data herding. Branch herding eliminates control divergence by forcing all threads in a warp to take the same control path. Data herding eliminates memory divergence by forcing each thread in a warp to load from the same memory block. To safely and efficiently support branch and data herding, we propose a static analysis and compiler framework to prevent exceptions when control and data errors are introduced, a profiling framework that aims to maximize performance while maintaining acceptable output quality, and hardware optimizations to improve the performance benefits of exploiting error tolerance through branch and data herding. Our software implementation of branch herding on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 improves performance by up to 34% (13%, on average) for a suite of NVIDIA CUDA SDK and Parboil benchmarks. Our hardware implementation of branch herding improves performance by up to 55% (30%, on average). Data herding improves performance by up to 32% (25%, on average). Observed output quality degradation is minimal for several applications that exhibit error tolerance, especially for visual computing applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376229/","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6376229/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13234900","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Branch and Data Herding: Reducing Control and Memory Divergence for Error-Tolerant GPU Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Branch and Data Herding: Reducing Control and Memory Divergence for Error-Tolerant GPU Applications","sourcePdf":"tmm-sartori-2232647-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061486S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6412815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6412815","articleId":"6376229","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376233,"authors":[{"name":"Oh-Min Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6410064/6376233/6376233-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oh-Min Kwon received the B.S degree in electronic engineering from Kyungbuk National University, Daegu, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 1997 and 2004, respectively.","He was a Senior Researcher with the Mechatronics Center, Samsung Heavy Industries, Daejeon, Korea, from 2004 to 2006.

Firstly, we propose an improvement to basic non-local means filter (NLMF) by incorporating discontinuity adaptive weights, instead of Gaussian weights for similarity assessment of patches in NLMF. As against the NLMF, discontinuity-adaptive NLMF (DA-NLMF) exhibit better edge and detail preserving capability, while providing very effective de-noising at the homogeneous areas. Secondly, we propose to apply DA-NLMF on recently proposed Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter (ISUKF) [1], which can also be thought of as an elegant post processing technique, in general. Specifically, we propose an efficient method for de-speckling Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery by combining ISUKF and DA-NLMF. In our approach, the DA-NLMF provides an efficient de-speckling as well as feature preservation, when its parameters of its (DA) weighting function are derived from ISUKF results. The performance of these methods is demonstrated on both synthetic and real examples, and the proposed method gives excellent results than the standard speckle filtering methods as well as various advanced methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6566043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2231055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6566043/06376246.pdf","startPage":"1964","endPage":"1970","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2231055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discontinuity Adaptive Non-Local Means With Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter for De-Speckling SAR Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuity Adaptive Non-Local Means With Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter for De-Speckling SAR Images","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376246/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13678806","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuity Adaptive Non-Local Means With Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter for De-Speckling SAR Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-nair-2231055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075166S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6566043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6566043","articleId":"6376246","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":6376249,"authors":[{"name":"Chase C.

Despite lacking an onboard pilot, UAVs require crews of up to three human operators. These crews are already experiencing high workload levels, which is a problem that will be likely compounded as the military envisions a future where a single operator controls multiple UAVs. To accomplish this goal, effective scheduling of UAVs and human operators is crucial to future mission success. We present a mathematical model for simultaneously routing UAVs and scheduling human operators, subject to operator workload considerations. This model is thought to be the first of its kind. Numerical examples demonstrate the dangers of ignoring the human element in UAV routing and scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2216871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221021/6530659/06376249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2216871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530659","startPage":"860","endPage":"874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating Human Factor Considerations in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Human Factor Considerations in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13563824","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6376249/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Human Factor Considerations in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing","sourcePdf":"tsmc-murray-2216871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14294S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6530659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6530659","articleId":"6376249","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6376251,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Song","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6670128/6376251/6376251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Song received the M.Eng. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1995, the M.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2011.","He is currently with the School of Electronics and Information, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China.

Some M-matrix strategies are developed to address several challenging issues in the pinning control of multiagent systems by using algebraic graph theory and the properties of nonnegative matrices. It is shown that second-order leader-following consensus in a nonlinear multiagent system can be reached if the virtual leader has a directed path to every follower and a derived quantity is greater than a positive threshold. In particular, this paper analytically proves that leader-following consensus may be easier to be achieved by pinning more agents or increasing the pinning feedback gains. A selective pinning scheme is then proposed for nonlinear multiagent systems with directed network topologies. Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2227723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6670128/06376251.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2227723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"--Matrix Strategies for Pinning-Controlled Leader-Following Consensus in Multiagent Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376251/","displayDocTitle":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-Matrix Strategies for Pinning-Controlled Leader-Following Consensus in Multiagent Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914871","pubMedId":"24273144","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376251/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$M$</tex></formula>-Matrix Strategies for Pinning-Controlled Leader-Following Consensus in Multiagent Systems With Nonlinear Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tcyb-song-2227723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101341S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6670128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6670128","articleId":"6376251","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6376255,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Samie","affiliation":["Bristol Robotics Laboratory, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6594872/6376255/6376255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Samie received the B.Sc. degree from Saveh University, Saveh, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 1998 and 2002, respectively, both in electronics engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in advanced electronic from the University of the West of England (UWE), Bristol, U.K., in 2012.","He was with the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, UWE, from 2008 to 2012, where he was involved in research on self-healing cellular architectures for biologically inspired highly reliable electronic systems funded by EPSRC, a joint research establishment between UWE and the University of Bristol.

Since failures are local, their repair will often be taken on the local (cell) level. Engineers have long sought systems that could offer similar reliability and have relatively recently started trying to integrate ideas inspired by nature into the modern silicon technology of today. While bio-inspired proposals inspired by multicellular systems demonstrated feasibility, the resulting systems were often unduly complex. We are proposing a radically new methodology inspired by the characteristics, morphology, and behavior of simpler prokaryotic bacteria and bacterial communities. The hypothesis we use is that such simple unicellular organisms could help to build simpler cost effective systems, but with improved reliability than hitherto achieved by other methods. The result is a cellular array-based fault-tolerant electronic system with online self-test and self-repair capability. These ideas are simulated, tested, and verified through the successful construction of demonstrators: a proportional, integral, and differential and a robot controller. This paper discusses the underlying biological principles that guide our research and the bio-inspired model that we have derived. It also gives a detailed circuit and system description of the architecture and its run-time self-diagnostic and self-repair capability.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2220793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6594872/06376255.pdf","startPage":"1878","endPage":"1891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2220793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6594872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Bio-Inspired Approach for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376255/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Bio-Inspired Approach for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Systems","volume":"21","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767591","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376255/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Bio-Inspired Approach for Fault-Tolerant VLSI Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-samie-2220793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073841S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6594872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6594872","articleId":"6376255","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376256,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Maleki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6376256/6376256-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Maleki (M\u201909) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

Space shift keying (SSK) is a simple example of SMod. In SMod, multiple antennas at the transmitter are employed to spatially modulate the information. The constellation vectors at the receiver are linear combinations of columns of the channel matrix, and therefore, the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the system highly depends on the Euclidean distance between each pair of these vectors. In this paper, we propose two novel methods to design the transmit vectors using CSIT such that the distance between each pair of constellation vectors at the receiver becomes larger, which, in turn, reduces the SER. Whereas in the first method we do not impose any constraint on the structure of the transmit vectors, in the second method, we confine the transmit vectors to have only one nonzero entry, and as such, it can be looked at as a modified SSK (MSSK) transmission scheme. This is to avoid interantenna synchronization (IAS) as only one transmit antenna is active at a time. Compared to SSK, the first method provides a significant performance improvement at the expense of increased complexity at the transmitter due to IAS. The second method provides an appealing SER improvement while keeping the complexity the same as that of SSK. Therefore, one can look at the second method as a modified version of SSK in which instead of transmitting a fixed symbol from one of the transmit antennas, in our proposed method, different transmit powers and phases are assigned to different transmit antennas. As acquiring full CSIT is difficult in some cases, we also consider the case of imperfect CSIT and derive alternative SMod transmission schemes in this case. By simulation, we show that the proposed SMod transmission schemes provide a significant performance improvement in terms of the SER in the presence of full or imperfect CSIT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"62","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13487035","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6376256/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space Modulation With CSI: Constellation Design and Performance Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Modulation With CSI: Constellation Design and Performance Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tvt-bahrami-2232686-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103077S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6376256","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6376260,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Fading coefficients of the Rician channel are considered to be correlated. Different scenarios are then considered for the Rician channel. We derive exact expressions for the moment-generating function (mgf) and the first and second moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination to statistically characterize system behavior. We also derive the exact expressions for the probability density function (pdf) and the cumulative distributive function (cdf) to discuss system behavior with the Rician factor. We then analyze system performance by deriving new analytical expressions for the bit error rate (BER), outage probability, amount of fading (AoF), diversity order, and array gain. These performance metrics reveal that strong line-of-sight (LoS) components between a relay-destination link always limit the performance promised by the MIMO scattering environment when both nodes have multiple antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06376260.pdf","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2232948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2232948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying With OSTBC Over Rayleigh\u2013Rician Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Antennas","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","probability","radio links","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh-Rician fading channel","orthogonal space-time block-coded transmission","OSTBC transmission","multiple-input multiple-output channel","MIMO channel","noncoherent amplify-and-forward MIMO relaying","AF relaying","source-relay channel","relay-destination channel","fading coefficient","moment-generating function","instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","system behavior","probability density function","PDF","cumulative distributive function","CDF","system performance","bit error rate","BER","outage probability","amount of fading","AoF","diversity order","array gain","line-of-sight component","LoS component","relay-destination link","MIMO scattering environment","multiple antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amount of fading (AoF)","amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying","array gain","bit error rate (BER)","diversity order","moment-generating function (mgf)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal space\u2013time block codes (OSTBC)","Rayleigh fading","Rician fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying With OSTBC Over Rayleigh\u2013Rician Fading Channels","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376260/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487037","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying With OSTBC Over Rayleigh\u2013Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-jayasinghe-2232948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22422S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6376260","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6376261,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gachon University, Seongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065070400"},{"name":"Oh-Soon Shin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Oh-Soon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37271728500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6376261","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1131},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming scheme to realize a full-duplex relay (FDR) in multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relaying systems.

In the proposed scheme, a weight is imposed on each discrete OFDM signal via a certain kind of a bandlimited signal, and an OFDM signal formed with the weighted discrete data is then considered before a high power amplifier (HPA), whereas the original signal can be recovered completely at the receiver side. Meanwhile, the time duration needed to transmit the weighted OFDM signal is the same as the time duration for the original OFDM signal. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated with computer simulations. According to numerical results, the PAPR of the weighted OFDM signal is smaller than that of the clipping and filtering (C&F) method, and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the weighted OFDM system is improved compared with the C&F method.

It is shown that different price responsive behaviors of electricity loads are results from interactions between their utilities to customers as a function of time and electricity prices. Based on this observation, a parametric utility model is introduced, from which the price elastic behaviors of aggregated loads are effectively modeled as a set of multi-dimensional demand-price functions. The developed demand elasticity model is further utilized in determining the optimal price signal for Real-Time Pricing (RTP) based Demand Response (DR) programs. Considering price elastic behaviors of customers, it is shown that the optimal real-time prices to induce the desired power consumption behaviors from customers for social welfare maximization can be effectively pre-calculated by utility company using the developed demand elasticity model without the need for excessive information exchange among end users and utility companies. Typical results of the proposed methods are further illustrated through numerical examples from a 6-bus test system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2217400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06376272.pdf","startPage":"1734","endPage":"1742","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2217400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Demand-Price Model With Its Application in Optimal Real-Time Price","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Demand-Price Model With Its Application in Optimal Real-Time Price","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6376272/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13190991","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Demand-Price Model With Its Application in Optimal Real-Time Price","sourcePdf":"tsg-yu-2217400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086942S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6376272","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6376274,"authors":[{"name":"Saman Zonouz","affiliation":["University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Zonouz","id":"38577393200"},{"name":"Katherine M.

In this paper, we present a security-oriented cyber-physical state estimation (SCPSE) system, which, at each time instant, identifies the compromised set of hosts in the cyber network and the maliciously modified set of measurements obtained from power system sensors. SCPSE fuses uncertain information from different types of distributed sensors, such as power system meters and cyber-side intrusion detectors, to detect the malicious activities within the cyber-physical system. We implemented a working prototype of SCPSE and evaluated it using the IEEE 24-bus benchmark system. The experimental results show that SCPSE significantly improves on the scalability of traditional intrusion detection techniques by using information from both cyber and power sensors. Furthermore, SCPSE was able to detect all the attacks against the control network in our experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2217762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06376274.pdf","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2217762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCPSE: Security-Oriented Cyber-Physical State Estimation for Power Grid Critical Infrastructures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376274/","displayDocTitle":"SCPSE: Security-Oriented Cyber-Physical State Estimation for Power Grid Critical Infrastructures","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13190993","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376274/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCPSE: Security-Oriented Cyber-Physical State Estimation for Power Grid Critical Infrastructures","sourcePdf":"tsg-azonouz-2217762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094274S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6376274","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6376275,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Pedro Reviriego is an Associate Professor at the Universidad Antonio de Nebrija.

We assume that the BS estimates the channel through uplink training, and then uses this channel estimate to detect the signals transmitted from a multiplicity of autonomous users in its cell. By taking the correlation between the channel estimate and the interference from other cells into account, we propose an optimal linear receiver (OLR) which maximizes the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR). Analytical approximations of the exact and lower bound on the achievable rate are then derived. The bound is very tight, especially at large number of BS antennas. We show that at low SINR, maximal ratio combing (MRC) receiver performs as well as OLR, however at high SINR, OLR outperforms MRC. Compared with the typical minimum mean-square error receiver, our proposed OLR improves systematically the system performance, especially when the interference is large.","doi":"10.1109/Swe-CTW.2012.6376290","publicationTitle":"2012 Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362374/6376277/06376290.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Swe-CTW.2012.6376290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of large scale MU-MIMO with optimal linear receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376290/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of large scale MU-MIMO with optimal linear receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172798","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376290/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of large scale MU-MIMO with optimal linear receivers","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p59ngo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108031S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362374","isNumber":"6376277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362374","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6376277","articleId":"6376290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376291,"authors":[{"name":"Maksym A.

That is, we consider a scenario, where a CRN operates in parallel to the primary network provided that the interference created to the primary network is limited by an acceptable threshold. The CNR is assumed to be a multi-hop relay network and hence before reaching the destination information from the source node may pass several hops from node to node. At each hop, the information is decoded and forwarded to the following node. It is further assumed that transmissions can be overheard by neighboring nodes, thereby creating interference. The power at each node can be optimally adjusted so that the end-to-end throughput of the CRN is maximized, while the constraint on interference towards the primary network is satisfied. In this paper, we show that for line CRNs the optimal power allocation is achieved when capacities of all intermediate links are equal and the interference constraint of the most disturbed primary user is fulfilled with equality. To simplify the computation of the optimal power allocation we derive two approximate solutions as well as several distributed power allocation schemes. The numerical results illustrate the interplay between the proposed solutions and the optimal power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/Swe-CTW.2012.6376291","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362374/6376277/06376291.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Swe-CTW.2012.6376291","publicationTitle":"2012 Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation for multi-hop decode-and-forward cognitive radio networks with line topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation for multi-hop decode-and-forward cognitive radio networks with line topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376291/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172799","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation for multi-hop decode-and-forward cognitive radio networks with line topology","confLoc":"Lund, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p7girnyk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062001S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362374","isNumber":"6376277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362374","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6376277","articleId":"6376291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376299,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, no exact results are provided, and many approximate models do not scale even for the simple network of two caches connected in tandem. In this paper, we introduce a Time-To-Live based policy (TTL), that assigns a timer to each content stored in the cache and redraws the timer each time the content is requested (at each hit/miss). We show that our TTL policy is more general than LRU, FIFO or RND, since it is able to mimic their behavior under an appropriate choice of its parameters. Moreover, the analysis of networks of TTL-based caches appears simpler not only under the Independent Reference Model (IRM, on which many existing results rely) but also with the Renewal Model for requests. In particular, we determine exact formulas for the performance metrics of interest for a linear network and a tree network with one root cache and N leaf caches. For more general networks, we propose an approximate solution with the relative errors smaller than 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n and 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n for exponentially distributed and constant TTLs respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376293","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International ICST Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362325/6376293/06376299.pdf","publicationTitle":"6th International ICST Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376299","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Analytical models","Manganese","Educational institutions","Steady-state","Magnetic resonance imaging","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TTL-based cache networks","performance analysis","information-centric networks","time-to-live based policy","independent reference model","renewal model","linear network","tree network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of TTL-based cache networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172714","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6376299/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376299/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of TTL-based cache networks","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"mainmatter0001nicaiseeric.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070266S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362325","isNumber":"6376293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362325","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6376293","articleId":"6376299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6376321,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Galindo-Serrano","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Galindo-Serrano","id":"38277739800"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Altman","id":"37266347900"},{"name":"Lorenza Giupponi","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorenza","lastName":"Giupponi","id":"37281677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-936968-63-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4887-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376321","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","pricing","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equilibrium selection","interference management noncooperative games","femtocell networks","n-person noncooperative games","weakly coupled constrained games","WCCG","macrocell associated users","normalized Nash equilibrium","pricing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell system","interference management","non-cooperative game","equilibrium selection","normalized equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we apply a special class of n-person non-cooperative games, which we call Weakly Coupled Constrained Games (WCCG), in femtocell systems to manage the aggregated interference they may generate at macrocell associated users.

By offering resource reservations in advance, providers gain insight into the projected demand of their customers and can act accordingly. However, customers need to be given an incentive, e.g. discounts granted, to commit early to a provider and to honestly, i.e. truthfully, reserve their predicted future resource requirements. Customers may reserve capacity deviating from their truly predicted demand, in order to exploit the mechanism for their own benefit, thereby causing futile costs for the provider. In this paper we prove, using a game theoretic approach, that i) truthful reservation is the best, i.e. dominant, strategy for customers if they are capable to make precise forecasts of their demands and that ii) deviations from truthtelling can be profitable for customers if their demand forecasts are uncertain.","doi":"10.4108/valuetools.2012.250173","publicationTitle":"6th International ICST Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International ICST Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362325/6376293/06376332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/valuetools.2012.250173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376293","startPage":"253","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards truthful resource reservation in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards truthful resource reservation in cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376332/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172746","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6376332/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards truthful resource reservation in cloud computing","confLoc":"Cargese, France","sourcePdf":"mainmatter0253funke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097084S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362325","isNumber":"6376293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362325","xplore-issue":"6376293","articleId":"6376332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376347,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh M.

With respect to the interleaver address generation, we propose and analyze a recursive address calculation method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Vectors","Complexity theory","Routing","Hardware","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","decoding","interleaved codes","Long Term Evolution","turbo codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architectures","QPP interleavers","LTE turbo decoders","quadratic-permutation-polynomial interleavers","turbo coding","4G-mobile-system LTE","parallel contention-free memory accesses","CMOS technologies","bit rate 1 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376355","doi":"10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376355","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362324/6376346/06376355.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376355/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI architectures of QPP interleavers for LTE turbo decoders","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172259","htmlLink":"/document/6376355/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI architectures of QPP interleavers for LTE turbo decoders","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071367S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362324","isNumber":"6376346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362324","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6376346","articleId":"6376355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376358,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Van Herrewege","affiliation":["ESAT/COSIC, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Van Herrewege","id":"38527018400"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["ESAT/COSIC, KU Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2896-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2895-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2894-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376358","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis","Random access memory","Computer architecture","Polynomials","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","BCH codes","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-specific programmable processor","BCH decoding","design optimisation","PUF key extractor","BCH code","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BCH decoding","processor design","PUF key extraction","FPGA design"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel design for a tiny application-specific programmable processor for BCH decoding.

Indeed, integration density and technology scaling are causing undesirable operating temperatures, having net impact on reduced reliability and increased cooling costs. Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) approaches have been proposed in literature to control temperature profile at run-time, while design-time approaches generally provide floorplan-driven solutions to cope with temperature constraints. Nevertheless, a suitable approach to collect performance, thermal and reliability metrics has not been proposed, yet. This work presents a novel methodology to jointly optimize temperature/performance trade-off in reliable high-performance parallel architectures with security constraints achieved by workload physical isolation on each core. The proposed methodology is based on a linear formal model relating temperature and duty-cycle on one side, and performance and duty-cycle on the other side. Extensive experimental results on real-world use-case scenarios show the goodness of the proposed model, suitable for design-time system-wide optimization to be used in conjunction with DTM techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362324/6376346/06376363.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal/performance trade-off in network-on-chip architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Mathematical model","Clocks","Tiles","Program processors","Multicore processing","Thermal management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","performance evaluation","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal-performance trade-off","network-on-chip architectures","multicore architectures","integration density","technology scaling","dynamic thermal management","thermal metrics","reliability metrics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Thermal/performance trade-off in network-on-chip architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172267","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal/performance trade-off in network-on-chip architectures","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073187S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362324","isNumber":"6376346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362324","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6376346","articleId":"6376363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376364,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Roth","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Roth","id":"38494600400"},{"name":"Simon Reder","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Reder","id":"38528094600"},{"name":"G\u00f6khan Erdogan","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"G\u00f6khan","lastName":"Erdogan","id":"38528821000"},{"name":"Oliver Sander","affiliation":["Institute for Information Processing Technology (ITIV), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Sander","id":"37528638900"},{"name":"Gabriel M.

Time-consuming detailed simulations make the design of such systems increasingly sophisticated. In this work, applicability of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) in the context of cycle-accurate Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) simulation is investigated on the Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC) from Intel. The presented strategy targets asynchronous parallel model execution where only adjacent model partitions need to synchronize with each other in order to advance in simulation time. Performance of the approach is evaluated by means of a scalable cycle-accurate MPSoC model called HeMPS. For a 8\u00d78 RTL model measurements reveal a speedup versus sequential RTL simulation of 25.3\u00d7. When exchanging RTL processing elements by cycle-accurate simulators a speedup of 56.3\u00d7 versus sequential RTL simulation is obtained. These results promise good suitability of the asynchronous strategy for detailed parallel MPSoC simulation on an architecture like the SCC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362324/6376346/06376364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2012 International Symposium on System on Chip (SoC)","doi":"10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSoC.2012.6376364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376346","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous parallel MPSoC simulation on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Synchronization","Kernel","Computational modeling","Receivers","Computer architecture","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete event simulation","embedded systems","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous parallel MPSoC simulation","single-chip cloud computer","embedded applications complexity","multicore processors","time-consuming detailed simulations","parallel discrete event simulation","PDES","cycle-accurate multiprocessor system-on-chip","SCC","Intel","HeMPS","RTL model measurements","sequential RTL simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous parallel MPSoC simulation on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376364/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172268","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous parallel MPSoC simulation on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112317S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362324","isNumber":"6376346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362324","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6376346","articleId":"6376364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376391,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38527222300"},{"name":"Jun Xiang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xiang","id":"38528686900"},{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liu","id":"38526525300"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Training Center, Dongguan Polytechnic College, Dongguan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38527222500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4899-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376391","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","OFDM","Baseband","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency modulation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interference suppression","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IS-OFDM","universal decoding method","baseband systems","NBI suppressing","frequency band transmitting systems","interference suppressing-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","narrowband interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IS-OFDM","complex channel","frequency band system","digital quadrature modulation","software defined radio","NBI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a universal decoding method is proposed to solve the problems in both base band and frequency band systems.

This design is realized in Xilinx Vertex5 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The 2-D IDCT decoding processor has advantages of high precision, low complexity and high speed. In this design we uses Loeffler's fast algorithm to reduce the power consumption. Previously, Zhu proposed a method which was used in IDCT Lee's algorithm. It uses the favorable combination of the additions and shifts to replace the linear multiplications of butterfly structure in lee's algorithm. Based on the methodology proposed by Zhu, we improved Loeffler's algorithm and obtain a high operating frequency and high precision IP. At the same time we can use the parity of the Loeffler's algorithm to implement this method, which also reduced the complexity of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose an efficient pipelining FPGA implementation of the 2D IDCT. The operating frequency of 2-D IDCT decoder can reach as high as 278 MHz and the precision of coefficient can be at 17 bits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Decoding","Signal processing algorithms","Discrete cosine transforms","IP networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","field programmable gate arrays","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance 2D IDCT for image-video decoding","FPGA","inverse discrete cosine transform processor","Xilinx Vertex5 Field Programmable Gate Array","2D IDCT decoding processor","Loeffler fast algorithm","DCT Lee algorithm","butterfly structure linear multiplications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376582","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376582","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6366004/6376576/06376582.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376582/","displayDocTitle":"High performance 2-D IDCT for Image/Video Decoding based on FPGA","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13173259","htmlLink":"/document/6376582/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance 2-D IDCT for Image/Video Decoding based on FPGA","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076516S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6366004","isNumber":"6376576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6366004","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6376576","articleId":"6376582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376591,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Au","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China","University of Tongji, China"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Au","id":"37271414400"},{"name":"Sijin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sijin","lastName":"Li","id":"37898805500"},{"name":"Ruobing Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ruobing","lastName":"Zou","id":"37641692200"},{"name":"Wei Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Dai","id":"37895432400"},{"name":"Lin Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37893973100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0173-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376591","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Motion compensation","Cameras","Video sequences","Transform coding","Estimation","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","data compression","digital photography","motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital photo album compression","global motion compensation","intra-prediction","inter-prediction","digital camera","digital photo organization","digital photo management","lossy coding scheme","similar image sets","GMC","local motion compensation","LMC","video coding technology","digital photo storage","digital photo transmission","digital photo processing"]}],"abstract":"With the increasing popularity of digital camera, organizing and managing the large collection of digital photos effectively become popular. Most researchers focus on clustering and image retrieval, but never on photo album compression. Some set redundancy methods for compressing similar image sets cannot handle photo album compression well because they don't account for any camera and object motion information between images. In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of camera and object motion between similar photos and designed a novel lossy coding scheme for similar image sets. In our proposed coding scheme, we applied Global Motion Compensation (GMC), Local Motion Compensation (LMC) and Intra prediction inspired from video coding technology. Our method provides a compact and reasonable format for people to store and transmit their large number of digital photos. Experiments prove that our algorithm is efficient and effective for digital photo processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital photo album compression based on Global Motion Compensation and Intra/Inter prediction","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376591","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6366004/6376576/06376591.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Digital photo album compression based on Global Motion Compensation and Intra/Inter prediction","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376591/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13173268","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital photo album compression based on Global Motion Compensation and Intra/Inter prediction","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085835S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6366004","isNumber":"6376576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6366004","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6376576","articleId":"6376591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376609,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chen","lastName":"Chang","id":"38475035400"},{"name":"Chun-Yu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Yu","lastName":"Yang","id":"38488060800"},{"name":"Chia-Hsing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsing","lastName":"Li","id":"37961827000"},{"name":"Huang-Jen Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huang-Jen","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37278332200"},{"name":"Yu-Kang Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Kang","lastName":"Lo","id":"37270301800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0173-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376609","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"This paper presents a high-voltage power amplifier for driving flexible paper speaker.

To construct Chinese word-based n-gram LMs, we need to have a lexicon and a Chinese word segmentation (CWS) step. However, there is no standard definition of a word in Chinese, and it is always possible to construct new words by combining multiple characters, which causes out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problems. These make lexicon definition and CWS being difficult and ill-defined, which deteriorates the quality of the Chinese LMs. Recently, conditional random fields (CRFs) have been shown to have the ability to perform robust and accurate CWS, especially in recalling OOV words. However they are in essence not Chinese language models, but conditional models of the position-of-character (POC) tag-sequence given the character-sequence. In this paper, we propose a new Chinese language model - joint n-gram, which incorporates the POC tags so that we escape from using a lexicon. It is a truly generative model of Chinese sentences. The effectiveness of the new LM is shown in terms of perplexities and CWS performances.","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376633","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6366004/6376576/06376633.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint n-gram Chinese language modeling with an application to Chinese word segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376633/","displayDocTitle":"Joint n-gram Chinese language modeling with an application to Chinese word segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13173310","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376633/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint n-gram Chinese language modeling with an application to Chinese word segmentation","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079212S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6366004","isNumber":"6376576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6366004","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6376576","articleId":"6376633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376634,"authors":[{"name":"Limin Hou","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Hou","id":"37892962300"},{"name":"Weiqi Wu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Weiqi","lastName":"Wu","id":"38528396300"},{"name":"Shuang Yang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Yang","id":"38525700300"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"38527473200"},{"name":"Xinpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"firstName":"Xinpeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279340100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0174-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0173-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"Audio tampering is often accompanied with resampling especially in audio splicing, re-compression, time-scale and pitch-scale modification etc. We assess the quality of re-sampling audio by two measures, in which Extended Bark Spectral Distortion model (EBSD) is adopted as an objective measure and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is selected as a subjective measure.

In order to achieve improved realism and perceived speaker directions in telepresence applications it may be desired to preserve some of the spatial information of the recorded sound rather than producing a single channel output. As a consequence, spatial hearing mechanisms in the auditory system of a listener may be triggered, which may potentially improve the intelligibility. This work represents a binaural beamforming approach which aims to preserve some of the spatial characteristics of the captured signal, with regard to head related transfer function (HRTF) of the left and right ears. Spherical microphone array configuration is used for the capturing of sound fields. Beam patterns are displayed for the left and right ears, and compared with the beam pattern of a conventional maximum directivity beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172896","htmlLink":"/document/6376910/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spherical array beamforming for binaural sound reproduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical array beamforming for binaural sound reproduction","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062201S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6376921,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Peleg","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Rafael Limited, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Peleg","id":"37294318700"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","Vectors","Encoding","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Information rates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian channels","signal detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse sensing","coded signals","Sub-Landau sampling rates","sparse sampling","transmitted signal encoding","information rates","Gaussian sparsely-sampled channel","state dependent channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse sampling","code","support","channel state"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376921","abstract":"Sparse sampling is examined jointly with encoding the transmitted signal.

One of the challenges in downlink (DL) SDMA is obtaining adequate channel state information at the base-station (BS) transmitter to minimize multi user interference (MUI). MUI minimization requires the BS to acquire accurate channel state information respective to the mobiles, achieved in the form of feedback. Digital feedback is usually made of a quantized version of either the channel matrix or the singular vectors. Naturally, finer quantization leads to more accurate channel state information and less MUI, but also to higher feedback capacity. Minimizing MUI is especially important when the number of transmitted SDMA streams is larger than the number of receive antennas at the mobiles, for example when a BS transmits M SDMA streams to M mobiles, each endowed with a single receive antenna. Here the mobiles do not have enough degrees of freedom to suppress the MUI, for example through an MMSE receiver (which would be possible if each mobile had at least M receive antennas). In this paper we propose MIMO-like ML detection of all M SDMA information streams at each of the mobiles (each is endowed with a single antenna). Here each mobile discards all the irrelevant streams, targeting other mobiles, post ML detection. Although counter-intuitive, when the optimal nonlinear ML detector is employed, the standard requirement of N \u2265 M receive antennas for spatial multiplexing detection is essentially eliminated. This approach is immediately extended to the case of N <; M receive antennas at the mobile, where N is not necessarily 1. The proposed method significantly outperforms standard detectors in the regime of high MUI due to insufficient feedback quantization. Thus, it paves the way to a significant decrease in feedback capacity and relaxed SDMA group selection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low feedback downlink SDMA using single antenna MIMO-like detection","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376929","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06376929.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low feedback downlink SDMA using single antenna MIMO-like detection","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376929/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172915","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low feedback downlink SDMA using single antenna MIMO-like detection","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050969S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6376930,"authors":[{"name":"Doron Ezri","affiliation":["Greenair Wireless, RamatGan, Israel"],"firstName":"Doron","lastName":"Ezri","id":"37601540600"},{"name":"Genadiy Tsodik","affiliation":["Auto Talks, Kfar Netter, Israel"],"firstName":"Genadiy","lastName":"Tsodik","id":"37601472500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376930","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Interference","OFDM","Array signal processing","Delay","Receivers","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","receiving antennas","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["null steering","interference mitigation","OFDM MIMO communications systems","cell-edge mobile uplink reception","signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio","SINR","thermal noise","receive beamforming solutions","next generation WiFi","intercell synchronization","LTE systems","cell-edge capacity","interference paths","OFDM receiver","temporal synchronization","frequency synchronization","angular spread","delay spread","MIMO channel model","single stream desired signal","receive antennas","spatial nulls","MVDR","minimum variance distortionless response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Receive Beamforming","Null Steering","MIMO","OFDM","Synchronization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of synchronization on receive beamforming with null steering in OFDM MIMO systems","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06376930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376930","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376930","abstract":"Receive beamfoming is one of the most prominent techniques to mitigate interference in OFDM MIMO communications systems. This technique is especially important in the uplink reception of cell-edge mobiles which are naturally associated with low signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR). In the common case where the interference is more dominant than the thermal noise, classical receive beamforming solutions, such as the minimum Variance distortionless response (MVDR), tend to place spatial nulls on the dominant interferers. It is well known that a receiver with N receive antennas can place up to N - 1 nulls while receiving a single stream desired signal. In this paper we adopt a practical MIMO channel model including delay and angular spread, and consider both synchronized and non synchronized systems. We reveal an intimate relationship between synchronization and null steering. In the case of adequate temporal and frequency synchronization, an OFDM receiver with N receive antennas may mitigate up to N - 1 interfering transmitters. However, in the absence of adequate synchronization, the same OFDM receiver may mitigate up to N - 1 interference paths. Since each transmitter is usually associated with multiple paths, this degradation may be very significant in terms of cell-edge capacity. The results in this paper may be of great practical importance, especially for the deployment of LTE systems, in which inter-cell synchronization is optional, and in comparisons between synchronized and non synchronized systems, such as next generation WiFi.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172916","htmlLink":"/document/6376930/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"The impact of synchronization on receive beamforming with null steering in OFDM MIMO systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of synchronization on receive beamforming with null steering in OFDM MIMO systems","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082553S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6376942,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomi Vituri","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomi","lastName":"Vituri","id":"38528631800"},{"name":"Meir Feder","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Meir","lastName":"Feder","id":"37284132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376942","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Integrated circuits","MIMO","Reactive power","Dispersion","Channel capacity","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infinite constellation dispersion","MIMO fading channels","power constraint","Poltyrev","multiple-input multiple-output fast fading channels","channel state information","CSI","radio receiver","optimal codewords","optimal normalized log density","optimal NLD","Poltyrev capacity","fixed error probability","inverse Q-function","channel dispersion"]}],"abstract":"In this work we extend the setting of communication without power constraint, proposed by Poltyrev, to a t \u00d7 r multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fast fading channels with channel state information (radio ) at the receiver.

Poltyrev's capacity for this channel is the highest achievable NLD, at possibly large number of channel uses, that guarantees a vanishing error probability. For a given finite number of channel uses n and a fixed error probability e, there is a gap between the highest achievable NLD and Poltyrev's capacity. As in other channels, this gap asymptotically vanishes as the square root of V over n, multiplied by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error probability \u03f5, where V is the channel dispersion.

In the Nyquist (average) rate case, we show that while nonuniform sampling amplifies the reconstruction error, it lowers the ECDQ coding rate (though not enough to achieve the Gaussian RDF).

The Shaping Gain is the reduction in average constellation energy, compared to a uniform (equi-probable) cubical constellation. The maximal Shaping Gain at high SNR is 1.53dB, which can be achieved by a constellation shape of a high dimensional ball with a uniform distribution. By freeing ourselves from the idea of equally probable symbols, we can reach the full shaping gain even with a one dimensional constellation. This idea has been studied before within the high SNR regime. We study and improve the system performance for medium SNRs (rates of 1-3 bit/1D) by inserting dither, and using MAP decoding to take into account the unequal probabilities. We also incorporate coding, and compare the system to regular coded uniform QAM signaling. The results show improvements of up to 0.6dB with respect to older works, and a total shaping gain of about 1dB.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376960","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06376960.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dithered probabilistic shaping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dithered probabilistic shaping","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376960/","accessionNumber":"13172946","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376960/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dithered probabilistic shaping","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040165S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6376961,"authors":[{"name":"Lior Landesman","affiliation":["Direct-beam, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Landesman","id":"37601424200"},{"name":"Erez Marom","affiliation":["Direct-beam, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Erez","lastName":"Marom","id":"37604967900"},{"name":"Ely Levine","affiliation":["Afeka Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Ely","lastName":"Levine","id":"37591887700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376961","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"A wireless modem Netgear WNDA4100 Un 3\u00d73 WiFi adapter had been tested in a typical office building at ranges of 20-30 meters.

For the evaluation, an audio-database for microphone array impulse responses and audio recordings (speech and noise) was created. Different acoustic scenarios were constructed, consisting of various audio sources (desired speaker, interfering speaker and directional noise) distributed around the microphone array at different angles and distances. The algorithms were compared based on both objective measure (signal-to-noise, signal-to-interference and speech distortion, and subjective tests (assessment of sonograms and informal listening tests).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13172951","htmlLink":"/document/6376965/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of supervised and semi-supervised beamformers using real audio recordings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of supervised and semi-supervised beamformers using real audio recordings","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063079S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6376974,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We take into account multi-parametric stochastic approach that combines the statistical description of the terrain and the built-up overlay with description of the signal intensity spatial distribution, taking into account the channel multipath effects from various natural and artificial obstructions located in the urban scene. The Rician K-parameter is used for multiplicative noise description, as a ratio of the coherent and incoherent components of the signal intensity [3]. Using the K-factor spatial distribution depending of the features of built-up terrain, an information data stream both for MIMO correlated antennas (the good case) and uncorrelated MIMO antennas (the worst case), as well as the capacity and spectral efficiency are predicted, depending on the \"reaction\" of different kinds of the terrestrial channel - rural, mixed residential, rural and urban. Finally, we give practical recommendations of how using the proposed combined LTE/MIMO Network with a Multi-beam antenna system will increase the system's capacity. This will allow the designers of wireless networks to obtain maximum data rate, better channel spectral efficiency and less bit error rate, and as a result, much better service and transmission performances.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06376974.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Main problems in LTE concept and the way of advanced LTE/MIMO networks performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Downlink","Noise","Transmitting antennas","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","correlation theory","error statistics","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multibeam antennas","multipath channels","multiuser channels","Rician channels","signal denoising","spectral analysis","statistical analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long term evolution","LTE","multiple input multiple output","multiuser multiple access deployment","multiparametric stochastic approach","statistical analysis","signal intensity spatial distribution","channel multipath effects","urban scene","Rician K-parameter","multiplicative noise description","coherent component","incoherent component","K-factor spatial distribution","MIMO correlated antenna","uncorrelated MIMO antenna","communication capacity","channel capacity","multibeam antenna system","wireless network","channel spectral efficiency","bit error rate","uncorrelated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Main problems in LTE concept and the way of advanced LTE/MIMO networks performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6376974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13172960","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Main problems in LTE concept and the way of advanced LTE/MIMO networks performance","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062953S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6376974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6376976,"authors":[{"name":"Itzik Kitroser","affiliation":["Department of communication Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel"],"firstName":"Itzik","lastName":"Kitroser","id":"37324808700"},{"name":"Yehuda Ben-Shimol","affiliation":["Department of communication Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel"],"firstName":"Yehuda","lastName":"Ben-Shimol","id":"38273368000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6376976","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"abstract":"This work addresses the problem of efficient broadcasting of resource allocations descriptors for VoIP traffic in mobile OFDMA-based wireless systems. We show that the mapping overhead is substantially reduced by using semi-persistent allocations and that by taking advantage of the periodicity of VoIP frames, generated by a multi-phase vocoder. To handle the impact of mobility on the characteristics of the wireless channel we utilize a cross-layer decision approach to track the channel conditions and predict the expected mobile user behavior such that the system may under-react to channel changes in some cases. We present mapping algorithms that implement these decisions and show by extensive simulations, that with these mapping algorithms the allocation overhead can be substantially reduced in OFDMA-based systems such as WiMAX and LTE, while retaining a low computational complexity (O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)).","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06376976.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6376976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: Cross-layer aware enhancement of VoIP mapping in wireless OFDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6376976/","xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: This document has been removed from IEEE Xplore in accordance with IEEE policy.

Constrained coding of a row of cells has been proposed for ICI mitigation by forbidding data patterns that induce interference above a chosen threshold level. We expand the interference model to two dimensions, and derive the severity function for row-by-row data programming. We propose a two-dimensional interference-constrained coding algorithm, based on adaptive one-dimensional encoding. Adaptation occurs at each encoding step, based on the data in the current row and in the previous one. Similarly, decoding is done in reverse. We explore the capacity bounds with the proposed constraints.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377006","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377006.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity two-dimensional data encoding for memory inter-cell interference reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity two-dimensional data encoding for memory inter-cell interference reduction","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377006/","accessionNumber":"13172991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377006/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity two-dimensional data encoding for memory inter-cell interference reduction","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060078S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6377019,"authors":[{"name":"Miri Blau","affiliation":["Applied Physics Department, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Miri","lastName":"Blau","id":"38516087200"},{"name":"Dan M.

There are several different approaches to determine the minimum standby voltage at which an SRAM array can preserve its data, also known as the array's Data Retention Voltage (DRV). The main goal of these approaches is to try and find the tail of the DRV distribution, since the worst SRAM bit cell sets the DRV of an entire memory block. The analytical approach concentrates on solving the sub-threshold voltage-transfer-characteristic equations of the core of a standard 6T bit cell. Another straight-forward method is running numerous Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the DRV at the required probability level. More advanced approaches based on static noise margin statistics remain valid for the extreme tails of the DRV distribution. Finally, the most accurate method is to use designated on-chip hardware to measure the DRV post-silicon fabrication. This paper overviews several recently proposed methods for DRV estimation and determination and discusses the advantages and trade-offs of these methods.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377025","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data retention voltage detection for minimizing the standby power of SRAM arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Data retention voltage detection for minimizing the standby power of SRAM arrays","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377025/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13173010","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data retention voltage detection for minimizing the standby power of SRAM arrays","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05128S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377026,"authors":[{"name":"Julius Georgiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Julius","lastName":"Georgiou","id":"37269839800"},{"name":"Evripides Kyriakides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Evripides","lastName":"Kyriakides","id":"38468821100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377026","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377026","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Resistance","Temperature","Neurons","Immune system","Metals","Crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","memristors","neurophysiology","nickel alloys","titanium alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor","energy-efficient processing","bioinspired processing","memristive NiTi structure","neural components","neural component","neuromorphic system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristors","Bio-inspired computation","Neuromorphic Engineering"]}],"abstract":"Although memristors have been around, both theoretically and physically for a long time, they have not really been exploited in today's computational infrastructure.

For the purpose of experimental verification, the proposed circuit was implemented using commercially available components and properly tested in an application of ladder filter. Experimental results are in a full agreement with theoretical expectations as well as PSpice simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377062/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13173046","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Frequency dependent negative resistor based on differential-input buffered and transconductance amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency dependent negative resistor based on differential-input buffered and transconductance amplifier","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052863S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6377075,"authors":[{"name":"Dariusz Ko\u015bcielnik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ko\u015bcielnik","id":"37294207100"},{"name":"Marek Mi\u015bkowicz","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Mi\u015bkowicz","id":"37541100500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377075","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Clocks","Capacitance","Conferences","Patents","Algorithm design and analysis","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","capacitors","charge exchange","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive charge redistribution","ADC","charge transfer","analog-to-digital conversion","binary scaled capacitor array","SCR","binary weighted capacitor","constant rate charge redistribution","source capacitor","destination capacitor","event-based SCR scheme","power converter","asynchronous ADC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous analog-to-digital converters","event-driven charge redistribution","analytical modeling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling event-driven successive charge redistribution in ADC with varying rate of charge transfer","abstract":"The paper addresses a technique of the asynchronous (clockless) analog-to-digital conversion based on the event-driven successive charge redistribution (SCR) in the binary-scaled capacitor array. A significant point is that the event-driven SCR-ADC differs from the known techniques of charge redistribution used in classical ADCs with the binary-weighted capacitors because the charge transfer is self-timed in the former whereas it is clock-driven in the latter. Former publications on event-driven SCR-ADC were based on constant-rate charge redistribution between the source and the destination capacitors realized by the current source in the number of steps defined by converter resolution. The contribution of the present study is the analysis of the event-based SCR scheme forced by voltage difference between both capacitors which decreases as the charge redistribution proceeds. The aim of the analysis is the evaluation of the conversion time of the relevant converter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377075","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377075","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377075.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377075/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling event-driven successive charge redistribution in ADC with varying rate of charge transfer","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13173059","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377075/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling event-driven successive charge redistribution in ADC with varying rate of charge transfer","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054287S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6377081,"authors":[{"name":"Shahar Kvatinsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shahar","lastName":"Kvatinsky","id":"37601405900"},{"name":"Keren Talisveyberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Keren","lastName":"Talisveyberg","id":"38525647400"},{"name":"Dmitry Fliter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Fliter","id":"38526924300"},{"name":"Avinoam Kolodny","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Avinoam","lastName":"Kolodny","id":"37298838100"},{"name":"Uri C.

Several memristor technologies have been developed such as ReRAM (Resistive RAM), MRAM (Magnetoresistance RAM), and PCM (Phase Change Memory). To design circuits with memristors, the behavior of the memristor needs to be described by a mathematical model. While the model for memristors should be sufficiently accurate as compared to the behavior of physical devices, the model must also be computationally efficient. Several models for memristors have been proposed - the linear ion drift model, the nonlinear ion drift model, the Simmons tunnel barrier model, and the ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor (TEAM) model. In this paper, the different memristor models are described and a Verilog-A implementation for these models, including the relevant window functions, are presented.

In this technique, coined integer-forcing equalization, the channel matrix is equalized at the receiver to one consisting of only integer entries. It was demonstrated that for quasi-static independent flat Rayleigh fading, and when independent streams are sent over each transmit antenna, this equalization technique allows to approach quite closely maximum-likelihood performance, using standard coding and decoding of off-the-shelf linear codes designed for transmission over a scalar white Gaussian channel. In particular, the technique is optimal in the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff sense. In the present work, we describe how this receiver structure may be seamlessly combined with linear transmit diversity methods.

Thus, it creates a mechanism that can tradeoff uplink rate to downlink rate. In this work we quantify this tradeoff between the feedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We show that uplink rate can be exchanged to downlink rate with a constant exchange ratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence time, and a decreasing function of the number of measured BSs. We also show that devoting a constant ratio of the uplink to CSI feedback can increase the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1. This capability to control the balance between the uplink and downlink rates is very important in cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to continuously changing user demands.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Mobile communication","Quantization","Interference","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","cellular radio","cooperative communication","MIMO communication","multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink downlink balancing","variable feedback rates","broadcast MIMO channel","cooperative multicell transmission","cellular network downlink capacity","channel state information feedback","CSI feedback","feedback rate","downlink rate","constant exchange ratio","channel coherence time","downlink multiplexing gain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377108","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377108.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink downlink balancing using variable feedback rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uplink downlink balancing using variable feedback rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377108/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377108/","accessionNumber":"13173092","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink downlink balancing using variable feedback rates","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064183S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6377120,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Ratsaby","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ariel University Center of Samaria, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Ratsaby","id":"38526278700"},{"name":"Vadim Sirota","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ariel University Center of Samaria, Ariel, Israel"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Sirota","id":"38527729100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377120","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Encoding","Random access memory","Data compression","Field programmable gate arrays","Data structures","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based data compressor","partial matching algorithm","data compression engine","text-classification application","arithmetic coding data compression","dynamic data structure","symbol frequency counts","tag-interval computation","data sequence","parallel architecture","speedup factor","frequency 50 MHz","frequency 3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data compression","FPGA","parallel architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377120","abstract":"We design and develop a data compression engine on a single FPGA chip that is used as part of a text-classification application.

The main purpose of anomaly detection is to detect pixel vectors (i.e. spectral vectors) whose spectra differ significantly from the background spectra. In anomaly detection, no prior knowledge about the target is assumed. In this paper we will present a new method for anomaly detection based on the SRX (Segmented RX) algorithm, with an emphasis on the edges between the segments. This method incorporates an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence which we developed for estimating the mixing coefficients of adjacent segments to fit the spectra of edge pixels. Achieving it allows us to reconstruct its mean vector and its covariance matrix, and operate the RX algorithm locally. The developed algorithm is a fusion and improvement of two algorithms (Steepest Descent and Newton's Method); it combines the benefits of each method while eliminating their drawbacks, so its convergence is fast and stable.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377129.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection using an adaptive algorithm for estimating mixtures of backgrounds in hyperspectral images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Vectors","Optimization","Hyperspectral imaging","Convergence","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","covariance matrices","geophysical image processing","gradient methods","image fusion","image segmentation","Newton method","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","adaptive algorithm","hyperspectral images","hyperspectral data","pixel vectors detection","spectral vectors","background spectra","SRX algorithm","segmented RX","fast convergence","mixing coefficients","edge pixels","mean vector","covariance matrix","steepest descent method","Newton method","image fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection using an adaptive algorithm for estimating mixtures of backgrounds in hyperspectral images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377129/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13173113","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection using an adaptive algorithm for estimating mixtures of backgrounds in hyperspectral images","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058451S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377132,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Laifenfeld","affiliation":["General Motors, Advanced Technical Center, Israel"],"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Laifenfeld","id":"37443754300"},{"name":"Igal Bilik","affiliation":["General Motors, Advanced Technical Center, Israel"],"firstName":"Igal","lastName":"Bilik","id":"37294015900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377132","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Fading","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","fading channels","optimisation","synchronisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed joint communication acquisition scheme","distributed compressive sensing","wireless sensor network","fading wireless communication channel","optimization","transmission time fraction","random sensing projection","rough time synchronization","channel estimation","WSN"]}],"abstract":"This work proposes a novel distributed joint communication-acquisition scheme for the compressive sensing (CS)-based wireless sensor networks (WSN)s over fast fading wireless communication channels.

Many practical systems that differ from ideal schemes have been discussed in the literature. One example is a system that lacks precise channel information at the transmitter. We evaluate analytically the performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique that uses partial channel knowledge. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with M transmit antennas and N receive antennas, employing eigenbeamforming at the transmitter and maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, where the receiver antennas experience correlated fading. We assume that only partial channel matrix is known to the transmitter, specifically only P out of N rows of the channel matrix are known. In addition, the transmitter is endowed with knowledge of the receive channel correlations. We derive the optimal beamformer for a single stream transmission case and show that it is the principal eigenvector of the known channel submatrix and the expected value of the unknown channel submatrix given the known channel. We show that the diversity order of a transmission scheme where such a preceder is used is MP+N-P and further show that increasing the value of P by one increases the diversity order by M - 1. We also derive the array gain for this scheme. We further show that, as expected, the effect of the correlation is only an array gain reduction. All the results are supported by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13173127","htmlLink":"/document/6377143/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance of optimal beamforming with partial channel knowledge in correlated fading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of optimal beamforming with partial channel knowledge in correlated fading","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056944S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377146,"authors":[{"name":"Meir Perez","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Meir","lastName":"Perez","id":"37588894900"},{"name":"Tshilidzi Marwala","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Tshilidzi","lastName":"Marwala","id":"37302936200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4681-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4682-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-4680-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Support vector machines","Cancer","Classification algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","genetic algorithms","lab-on-a-chip","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","pattern classification","simulated annealing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microarray data feature selection","hybrid genetic algorithm simulated annealing","viable cancer diagnostic system","HGASA algorithm","microarray classification architectures","separability index","artificial neural network","support vector machine","SVM classifier","Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier","NBC classifier","K-nearest neighbour","KNN classifier","population based incremental learning algorithm","PBIL algorithm","prostate cancer data set","lymphoma data set","ANN classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377146","abstract":"Microarray data feature selection is crucial for the development of a viable cancer diagnostic system based on microarray data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing (HGASA) algorithm in selecting features for various classification architectures. HGASA combines the parallel search capability of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the flexibility of Simulated Annealing (SA). The algorithm is guided by Separability Index, which quantifies the extent of class separability demonstrated by a combination of features. Four classifiers are used in the assessment: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier. Results from HGSA is compared to those from standard GA as well as to those from Population based incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm. Two data sets are used facilitate this analysis: a prostate cancer data set and a lymphoma data set. For the prostate cancer data set, features selected by the HGASA attained the highest classification accuracy on the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 88%. For the Lymphoma data set, the highest classification accuracy was attained using the ANN classifier, which attained an accuracy of 95%. The performance of the HGASA is ascribed to its ability to search the feature space more thoroughly by employing a deeper exploration of the feature space, when compared to GA and PBIL.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377146","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376891","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 27th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365376/6376891/06377146.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microarray data feature selection using hybrid genetic algorithm simulated annealing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377146/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Microarray data feature selection using hybrid genetic algorithm simulated annealing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377146/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13173130","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microarray data feature selection using hybrid genetic algorithm simulated annealing","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"ieeei2012submission90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062079S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365376","isNumber":"6376891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365376","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6376891","articleId":"6377146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6377219,"authors":[{"name":"Nimal Ekanayake","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka"],"bio":{"p":["Nimal Ekanayake (M'79) received the B.

We use diffusion maps to embed the data in a low dimensional representation, which separates the anomaly from the background. The diffusion distance between points is then used to estimate the local density of each pixel in the new embedding. The diffusion map is constructed based on a subset of samples from the image and then extended to all other pixels. Due to the interpolative nature of extension methods, this may limit the ability of the diffusion map to reveal the presence of the anomaly in the data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multiscale approach based on Gaussian pyramid representation, which drives the sampling process to ensure separability of the anomaly from the background clutter.

The power generation and radiator core is based on a novel method called distributed active radiation, which enables high conversion efficiency from DC to radiated terahertz power above f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n of a technology. The design evolution of the distributed active radiator (DAR) follows from an inverse design approach, where metal surface currents at different harmonics are formulated in the silicon chip for the desired electromagnetic field profiles. Circuits and passives are then designed conjointly to synthesize and control the surface currents. The DAR consists of a self-oscillating active electromagnetic structure, comprising of two loops which sustain out-of-phase currents at the fundamental frequency and in-phase currents at the second harmonic. The fundamental signal, thus gets, spatially filtered, while the second harmonic is radiated selectively, thereby consolidating signal generation, frequency multiplication, radiation of desired harmonic and filtration of undesired harmonics simultaneously in a small silicon footprint. A two-dimensional 4\u00d74 radiating array implemented in 45 nm SOI CMOS (without high-resistivity substrate) radiates with an EIRP of +9.4 dBm at 0.28 THz and beam-steers in 2D over 80\u00b0 in both azimuth and elevation. The chip occupies 2.7 mm \u00d7 2.7 mm and dissipates 820 mW of DC power. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported integrated beam-scanning array at THz frequencies in silicon.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2012.2217831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2012.2217831","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6392234/06377237.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.28 THz Power-Generation and Beam-Steering Array in CMOS Based on Distributed Active Radiators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"A 0.28 THz Power-Generation and Beam-Steering Array in CMOS Based on Distributed Active Radiators","volume":"47","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188536","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377237/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.28 THz Power-Generation and Beam-Steering Array in CMOS Based on Distributed Active Radiators","sourcePdf":"jssc-sengupta-2217831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139907S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6392234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6392234","articleId":"6377237","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6377238,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6516025/6377238/6377238-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiong Xu received the B.S. degree in photogrammetry from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing in the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing at Wuhan University, Wuhan.","His research interests include multi- and hyper-spectral image processing, artificial neural network, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Xu","id":"38506307000"},{"name":"Yanfei Zhong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6516025/6377238/6377238-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yanfei Zhong (M'11) received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He has been with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University since 2007 and is currently a Professor.

Traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms only utilize a low-resolution image, the information of which is not enough to obtain a high-resolution land-cover map. The accuracy of sub-pixel mapping can be improved by incorporating auxiliary datasets, such as multiple shifted images in the same area, to provide more sub-pixel land-cover information. In this paper, a sub-pixel mapping framework based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) model is proposed to utilize the complementary information of multiple shifted images. In the proposed framework, the sub-pixel mapping problem is transformed to a regularization problem, and the MAP model is used to regularize the sub-pixel mapping problem to be well-posed by adding some prior information, such as a Laplacian model. The proposed algorithm was compared with a traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithm based on a single image, and another multiple shifted images based sub-pixel mapping method, using both synthetic and real hyperspectral images. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms, and hence provides an effective option to improve the accuracy of sub-pixel mapping for hyperspectral imagery.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2227246","startPage":"580","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2227246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6516025/06377238.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Pixel Mapping Based on a MAP Model With Multiple Shifted Hyperspectral Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377238/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sub-Pixel Mapping Based on a MAP Model With Multiple Shifted Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6377238/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13499712","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Pixel Mapping Based on a MAP Model With Multiple Shifted Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhong-2227246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093186S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6516025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6516025","articleId":"6377238","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6377245,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Khodaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Amin Khodaei (M'11) received the B.S. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, the M.S. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago, in 2010, all in electrical engineering.","He was a visiting faculty (2010\u20132012) in the Robert W.

The objective in this paper is to minimize the total system planning cost comprising investment and operation costs of local microgrids, the co-optimized planning of large generating units and transmission lines, and the expected cost of unserved energy. The cost of unserved energy reflects the cost of load shedding which is added to the objective function for reliability considerations. The microgrid-based co-optimization planning problem is decomposed into a planning problem and annual reliability subproblem. The optimal integer planning decisions calculated in the planning problem will be examined against the system reliability limits in the subproblem and the planning decisions will be revised using proper feasibility cuts if the annual reliability limits are violated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid-based co-optimization planning in power systems and explore the economic and reliability merits of microgrid planning as compared to grid-based generation and transmission upgrades.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2224676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6504806/06377245.pdf","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2224676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microgrid-Based Co-Optimization of Generation and Transmission Planning in Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377245/","displayDocTitle":"Microgrid-Based Co-Optimization of Generation and Transmission Planning in Power Systems","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934108","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377245/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrid-Based Co-Optimization of Generation and Transmission Planning in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-khodaei-2224676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091796S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6377245","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6377246,"authors":[{"name":"Shaghayegh Bahramirad","affiliation":["S&C Electric Company, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6397636/6377246/6377246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaghayegh Bahramirad (M'11) holds multiple advanced degrees including a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.","She is a Project Engineer at S&C Electric Company, Chicago.

Utilizing the ESS, generation shortage due to outage of conventional units and intermittency of renewable units is handled; hence microgrid reliability criterion is satisfied. A practical model for ESS is utilized. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is utilized to formulate the problem.

However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06377247.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2218835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2218835","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Under Real-Time Pricing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377247/","displayDocTitle":"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Under Real-Time Pricing","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377247/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13190995","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Under Real-Time Pricing","sourcePdf":"tsg-chan-2218835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120176S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"348","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6377247","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377254,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza R.

This feed structure eliminates the fabrication of air bridges in direct CPW-fed tapered slot antennas (TSAs). Two millimeter-wave design techniques are introduced for the selected 41-61 GHz and 90-120 GHz frequency ranges, demonstrating very good impedance match and nearly constant gain, beamwidth, and cross-polarization levels over bandwidths of 39% and 28%, respectively. The design procedure is validated by comparing simulated results with measurements performed on a 21-31 GHz (38% bandwidth) prototype. Very good agreement between measured and calculated performance characteristics is obtained with only cross-polarization levels slightly higher than predicted. The structural design parameters and dimensions of all three designs are given.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6493417/06377264.pdf","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2232270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2232270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband CPW Feed for Millimeter-Wave SIW-Based Antipodal Linearly Tapered Slot Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coplanar waveguides","Broadband antennas","Feeds","Microstrip","Gain","Substrates","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","impedance matching","millimetre wave antennas","slot antennas","substrate integrated waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband CPW feed","millimeter-wave SIW-based antipodal linearly-tapered slot antenna design","ALTSA design","combined substrate integrated waveguide feed","regular coplanar waveguide feed","combined SIW-CPW feeds","air bridge fabrication","direct CPW-fed tapered slot antenna","direct CPW-fed TSA","millimeter-wave design technique","impedance match","nearly-constant gain","beamwidth","cross-polarization level","structural design parameter","frequency 41 GHz to 61 GHz","frequency 90 GHz to 120 GHz","bandwidth 21 GHz to 31 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna feeds","broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","Vivaldi antennas","waveguide transitions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Broadband CPW Feed for Millimeter-Wave SIW-Based Antipodal Linearly Tapered Slot Antennas","volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6377264/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413010","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband CPW Feed for Millimeter-Wave SIW-Based Antipodal Linearly Tapered Slot Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-bornemann-2232270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083959S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6493417","articleId":"6377264","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377275,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron J.

Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n <; 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6% on discrete and 10.9% on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4% on discrete and 14.1% on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Simultaneous Movements Using Surface EMG Pattern Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2232293","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6502208/06377275.pdf","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2232293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6502208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Simultaneous Movements Using Surface EMG Pattern Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6377275/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13730167","pubMedId":"23247839","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Simultaneous Movements Using Surface EMG Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"tbme-young-2232293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072502S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6502208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"6502208","articleId":"6377275","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6377276,"authors":[{"name":"Kadir Cil","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6387647/6377276/6377276-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kadir Cil (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Kocaeli University, Turkey, in 2006 and M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Connecticut (UConn) in 2011.

One of the MC methods in nature is the gap junction (GJ) communication between cardiomyocytes. The GJ communication is achieved by diffusion of ions through GJ channels between the cells. The transmission of the information is realized by means of the propagation of the action potential (AP) signal. The probabilities of both the AP propagation failure and the spontaneous AP initiation are obtained. For the first time in the literature, the GJ communication channel is modeled and analyzed from the information theoretical perspective to find the communication channel capacity. A closed-form expression is derived for the capacity of the GJ communication channel. The channel capacity, propagation delay, and information transmission rate are analyzed numerically for a three-cell network. The results of the numerical analyses point out a correlation between an increase in the incidence of several cardiac diseases and a decrease in the channel capacity, an increase in the propagation delay, and either an increase or a decrease in the transmission rate. The method that we use and results that are presented may help in the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac diseases as well as help in the design of nanodevices communicating via GJ channels.","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6475295/06377304.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6475295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2012.2233212","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2012.2233212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377304","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ions","Nanoscale devices","Logic gates","Channel capacity","Electric potential","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biodiffusion","bioelectric potentials","cellular biophysics","diseases","muscle","numerical analysis","patient diagnosis","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanodevices","cardiac disease treatment","cardiac disease diagnosis","channel capacity","numerical analysis","three-cell network","action potential propagation failure","probability","action potential signal propagation","ion diffusion","molecular communication","cardiomyocytes","nanoscale molecular gap junction communication channel","information theoretical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cardiac disease","cardiomyocyte","gap junction(GJ)","molecular communication(MC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Information Theoretical Analysis of Nanoscale Molecular Gap Junction Communication Channel Between Cardiomyocytes","accessionNumber":"13368615","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6377304/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information Theoretical Analysis of Nanoscale Molecular Gap Junction Communication Channel Between Cardiomyocytes","sourcePdf":"tnano-kilinc-2233212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078013S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6475295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6475295","articleId":"6377304","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6377305,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Heydari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6387345/6377305/6377305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Heydari (S\u201909) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in aerospace engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Inputs to the NN are the current system states and the time-to-go, and the network outputs are the costates that are used to compute optimal feedback control. Control constraints are handled through a nonquadratic cost function. Convergence proofs of: 1) the reinforcement learning-based training method to the optimal solution; 2) the training error; and 3) the network weights are provided. The resulting controller is shown to solve the associated time-varying Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and provide the fixed-final-time optimal solution. Performance of the new synthesis technique is demonstrated through different examples including an attitude control problem wherein a rigid spacecraft performs a finite-time attitude maneuver subject to control bounds. The new formulation has great potential for implementation since it consists of only one NN with single set of weights and it provides comprehensive feedback solutions online, though it is trained offline.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning

A 50-MHz switching frequency DPWM with 60-ps resolution and a 1-MHz switching frequency DPWM with 90-ps resolution are experimentally demonstrated, with monotonicity and excellent linearity.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2233218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2233218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6480842/06377307.pdf","startPage":"4466","endPage":"4472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6480842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Simple Digital Pulse Width Modulator Under 100\u00a0ps Resolution Using General-Purpose FPGAs","volume":"28","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13370181","htmlLink":"/document/6377307/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Digital Pulse Width Modulator Under 100\u00a0ps Resolution Using General-Purpose FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tpel-costinett-2233218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077179S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6480842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6480842","articleId":"6377307","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377308,"authors":[{"name":"Pengyu Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6415310/6377308/6377308-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengyu Jia was born in Hebei Province, China, in 1985.

It is proved that the existence of RHP zeros in output voltage models of the individual- or coupled-inductor superbuck converter is related to the duty ratio and the inductor parameters when there are no damping networks in the circuit. The constraints are tough for cancellation of RHP zeros when the duty ratio is extremely large. So, the output voltage models of the superbuck converter with damping networks are analyzed in this paper. It is proved that the parameter restrictions for no RHP zeros can be relaxed by using damping networks in the circuit. By simple assumptions, the restrictions can be easy to satisfy by proper design of damping network parameters. Both situations of resistor load and battery load have been considered individually. RHP zeros of output current models can be also canceled when the same design conditions are satisfied. The computed model analysis and experiment results verified the conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2231945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2231945","startPage":"3845","endPage":"3859","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6415310/06377308.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6415310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Design of Damping Networks for the Superbuck Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Design of Damping Networks for the Superbuck Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","volume":"28","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377308/","accessionNumber":"13245030","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377308/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Design of Damping Networks for the Superbuck Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-jia-2231945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067616S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6377308","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6377309,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Ta Su","affiliation":["Industry Standard Server, Hewlett-Packard Company, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jen-Ta Su was born in Changhua, Taiwan.

Operational tasks such as frame grabbing, image filtering and USB communication are integrated to the system by implementing custom-designed controllers in VHDL. Image processing functions are accelerated using a fully parallel pipeline which is described analytically. A host computer interface has also been developed in order to test the overall system in action. The system is evaluated in terms of resource usage and the advantages emanating from the proposed architecture are discussed.","publicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6377153/6377342/06377369.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration of Image Processing Algorithms Using Minimal Resources of Custom Reconfigurable Hardware","doi":"10.1109/PCi.2012.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCi.2012.11","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration of Image Processing Algorithms Using Minimal Resources of Custom Reconfigurable Hardware","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175653","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377369/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration of Image Processing Algorithms Using Minimal Resources of Custom Reconfigurable Hardware","confLoc":"Piraeus, Greece","sourcePdf":"4825a068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035838S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6377153","isNumber":"6377342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6377153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377342","articleId":"6377369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6377371,"authors":[{"name":"George Economakos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microprocessors and Digital Systems Laboratory, National and Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37373878200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2720-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4825-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377371","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ESL as a Gateway from OpenCL to FPGAs: Basic Ideas and Methodology Evaluation","abstract":"OpenCL has been proposed as an open standard for application development in heterogeneous multi-core architectures, utilizing different CPU, DSP and GPU types and configurations. Recently, the technological advances in FPGA devices, offering hundreds of GFLOPs with maximum power efficiency, has turned the parallel processing community towards them. However, FPGA programming requires expertise in a different field as well as the appropriate tools and methodologies. A promising solution, gaining wider acceptance lately, is the use of ESL and high-level synthesis methodologies, supporting C/C++ based hardware design. Starting from high-level synthesis, this paper presents a methodology for the adoption of OpenCL as an FPGA programming environment. Specifically, the opportunities as well as the obstacles imposed to the application developer by the FPGA computing platform and the use of C/C++ as input language are presented, and a systematic way to explore both data level and thread level parallelism is given. Experimental result show that efficient design space exploration is supported, with overall system level performance boost of up to 9x, compared to equivalent GPU implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Programming","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ESL","gateway","OpenCL","open standard","application development","heterogeneous multicore architecture","GPU","technological advances","FPGA device","GFLOP","power efficiency","parallel processing","high-level synthesis method","C based hardware design","C++ based hardware design","FPGA programming environment","FPGA computing platform","thread level parallelism","design space exploration","system level performance boost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenCL","multi-core architectures","FPGAs","high-level synthesis","parallel processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377371","doi":"10.1109/PCi.2012.45","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6377153/6377342/06377371.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCi.2012.45","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377371/","displayDocTitle":"ESL as a Gateway from OpenCL to FPGAs: Basic Ideas and Methodology Evaluation","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13175655","htmlLink":"/document/6377371/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ESL as a Gateway from OpenCL to FPGAs: Basic Ideas and Methodology Evaluation","confLoc":"Piraeus, Greece","sourcePdf":"4825a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041227S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6377153","isNumber":"6377342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6377153","xplore-issue":"6377342","articleId":"6377371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6377382,"authors":[{"name":"Danai Koutra","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Danai","lastName":"Koutra","id":"38529186300"},{"name":"Evangelos E.

When we have multi-aspect data, e.g. who published which paper on which conference and on what year, how can we combine this information, in order to obtain good summaries thereof and unravel hidden anomalies and patterns? Such multi-aspect data, including time-evolving graphs, can be successfully modelled using Tensors. In this paper, we show that when we have multiple dimensions in the dataset, then tensor analysis is a powerful and promising tool. Our method TENSORSPLAT, at the heart of which lies the \"PARAFAC\" decomposition method, can give good insights about the large networks that are of interest nowadays, and contributes to spotting micro-clusters, changes and, in general, anomalies. We report extensive experiments on a variety of datasets (co-authorship network, time-evolving DBLP network, computer network and Facebook wall posts) and show how tensors can be proved useful in detecting \"strange\" behaviors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6377153/6377342/06377382.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"2012 16th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics","doi":"10.1109/PCi.2012.60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCi.2012.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TensorSplat: Spotting Latent Anomalies in Time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Matrix decomposition","Vectors","Data mining","Facebook","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data analysis","graph theory","pattern clustering","social networking (online)","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TensorSplat","latent anomaly spotting","large time-evolving graph","multiaspect data","hidden anomalies","hidden patterns","tensor analysis","PARAFAC decomposition method","microcluster spotting","coauthorship network","time-evolving DBLP network","computer network","Facebook wall post","strange behavior detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"TensorSplat: Spotting Latent Anomalies in Time","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377382/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175666","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TensorSplat: Spotting Latent Anomalies in Time","confLoc":"Piraeus, Greece","sourcePdf":"4825a144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09034S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6377153","isNumber":"6377342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6377153","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6377342","articleId":"6377382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377391,"authors":[{"name":"Apostolos Glenis","affiliation":["Informatics Department, University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Glenis","id":"38529105400"},{"name":"Vu Pham","affiliation":["Polytech Nantes, University of Nantes, Nantes, France"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Pham","id":"38529104100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2720-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4825-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6377391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"The fuzzy c-means clustering is a well-known unsupervised algorithm and has been widely used in various pattern recognition applications.

This is the main motivation for utilizing the computational power of parallel machines to speed up the c-means algorithm. We present an algorithm that exploits the mathematical equations in c-means to create building blocks based on linear algebra functions that are optimized for most available parallel architectures. We implemented our algorithm on both GPU (using CUDA and CUBLAS) and MPI (using MPI4py and NumPy), then evaluated their performance and scalability.

An explicit expression of the network steady-state operating point is obtained based on the fixed-point equation of the limiting probability of successful transmission of Head-of-Line (HOL) packets given that the channel is idle, which is shown to be closely dependent on the backoff parameters of saturated groups and the input rates of unsaturated groups. Both the network throughput and the group throughput performance are further characterized, and the maximum network throughput is derived as an explicit function of the holding times of HOL packets in successful transmission and collision states. The analysis reveals that to achieve the maximum network throughput, the optimal set of input rates of unsaturated groups and initial backoff window sizes of saturated groups should satisfy a constraint that is determined by the group sizes of saturated groups. Given the input rates of unsaturated groups, for instance, the initial backoff window sizes of saturated groups should linearly increase with their group sizes, and those with higher increasing rates achieve lower group throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Optimization of Heterogeneous IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.120827","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06377480.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.120827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Optimization of Heterogeneous IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6377480/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250951","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Optimization of Heterogeneous IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks","sourcePdf":"398-tw1301-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120311S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377480","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6377481,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Rim Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6377481/6377481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang-Rim Lee (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007.

In practical implementations, each antenna is equipped with its own power amplifier and is limited individually by linearity of the amplifier. Thus, this paper adopts a more realistic per-antenna power constraint instead of conventional sum-power constraint on transmit antennas. To this end, we first show that a distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ZFBF scheme with per-antenna power constraint and equal-rate metric can be approximated as a minimum of chi-square random variables. Based on this result, we present an accurate formula of the average sum rate in a closed form. Furthermore, employing extreme value theory, an expression of the asymptotic average sum rate with large numbers of transmit antennas and users is derived from the limiting distribution of the received SNR. Simulation results verify the validity of our analysis even with not so large numbers of transmit antennas and users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.120332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"228","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06377481.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Forcing Beamforming in Multiuser MISO Downlink Systems Under Per-Antenna Power Constraint and Equal-Rate Metric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377481/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Zero-Forcing Beamforming in Multiuser MISO Downlink Systems Under Per-Antenna Power Constraint and Equal-Rate Metric","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250952","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Forcing Beamforming in Multiuser MISO Downlink Systems Under Per-Antenna Power Constraint and Equal-Rate Metric","sourcePdf":"228-tw1301-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079803S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377481","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6377483,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Faraji-Dana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada","Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6377483/6377483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zahra Faraji-Dana received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in electrical engineering from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, and University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The relay then directly decodes the network-coded combination {aS_A+bS_B} over \\mathbb{F} from the noisy received superimposed channel-encoded packets. The advantage of working over non-binary fields is that it offers the opportunity to decode according to multiple decoding coefficients (a,b). As only one of the network-coded combinations needs to be successfully decoded, a key advantage is then a reduction in error probability by attempting to decode against all choices of (a,b). In this paper, we compare different mappings between \\mathbb{F} and the PSK constellation, and prove that many have identical performance in terms of frame error rate (FER). Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the performance of decoding the network-coded combinations. Simulation results show that if we adopt either i) concatenated Reed-Solomon and convolutional coding or ii) low-density parity check codes, our non-binary constellations can outperform the binary case significantly in the sense of minimizing the FER and, in particular, the ternary constellation has the best FER performance among all considered cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","volume":"12","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13250954","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6377483/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Non-Binary Constellations for Channel-Coded Physical-Layer Network Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Non-Binary Constellations for Channel-Coded Physical-Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"312-tw1301-dana.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114557S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377483","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6377486,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6377486/6377486-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyeong J.

In this paper, we first analyze the performance of MDFH under hostile jamming. It is observed that while MDFH is robust under strong jamming, it experiences considerable performance losses under disguised jamming from sources that mimic the true signal. To overcome this limitation, we propose an anti-jamming MDFH (AJ-MDFH) system. The main idea is to transmit a secure ID sequence along with the information stream. The ID sequence is generated through a cryptographic algorithm using the shared secret between the transmitter and the receiver, it is then exploited by the receiver for effective signal extraction. It is shown that AJ-MDFH can effectively reduce the performance degradation caused by disguised jamming, and is also robust under strong jamming. In addition, we extend AJ-MDFH to the multi-carrier case, which can increase the system efficiency and jamming resistance significantly through jamming randomization and frequency diversity, and can readily be used as a collision-free multiple access system. Part II of the paper focuses on the capacity analysis of MDFH and AJ-MDFH under disguised jamming.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06377487.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.111706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.111706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part I: System Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Receivers","Frequency shift keying","Noise","Cryptography","Interference","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","jamming","radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anti-jamming message-driven frequency hopping","anti-jamming system design","wireless networks","spread spectrum technique","hostile jamming","secure ID sequence","information stream","cryptographic algorithm","transmitter","receiver","signal extraction","disguised jamming","jamming randomization","frequency diversity","collision-free multiple access system","capacity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-jamming systems","frequency hopping","physical layer security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part I: System Design","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6377487/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250958","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part I: System Design","sourcePdf":"070-tw1301-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069123S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377487","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377488,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6377488/6377488-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering in 2005 and 2007, respectively, both from Xidian University, Xi'an China.

In Part I, we point out that under disguised jamming, where the jammer mimics the authorized signal, MDFH experiences considerable performance losses like other wireless systems. To overcome this limitation, we propose an anti-jamming MDFH scheme (AJ-MDFH), which enhances the jamming resistance of MDFH by enabling shared randomness between the transmitter and the receiver using an AES generated ID sequence transmitted along the information stream. In part II, using the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) model, we analyze the capacity of MDFH and AJ-MDFH under disguised jamming. We show that under the worst case disguised jamming, as long as the secure ID sequence is unavailable to the jammer (which is ensured by AES), the AVC corresponding to AJ-MDFH is nonsymmetrizable. This implies that the deterministic capacity of AJ-MDFH with respect to the average probability of error is positive. On the other hand, due to lack of shared randomness, the AVC corresponding to MDFH is symmetric, resulting in zero deterministic capacity. We further calculate the capacity of AJ-MDFH and show that it converges as the ID constellation size goes to infinity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.111707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06377488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120312.111707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"80","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part II: Capacity Analysis Under Disguised Jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part II: Capacity Analysis Under Disguised Jamming","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250959","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6377488/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-Jamming Message-Driven Frequency Hopping\u2014Part II: Capacity Analysis Under Disguised Jamming","sourcePdf":"080-tw1301-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074487S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377488","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377489,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6377489/6377489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Han Yang (S'06) received his B.S. in electrical engineering in 2004, and two M.S. degrees in computer science and communication engineering in 2007, from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

However, the large delay spread gives rise to severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) when the data rate is high, and the achievable transmission rate is further degraded in the multiuser downlink due to the inter-user interference (IUI). In this work, we study the weighted sum rate optimization problem by means of waveform design in the time-reversal multiuser downlink where the receiver processing is based on a single sample. Power allocation has a significant impact on the waveform design problem. We propose a new power allocation algorithm named Iterative SINR Waterfilling, which is able to achieve comparable sum rate performance to that of globally optimal power allocation. We further propose another approach called Iterative Power Waterfilling for multiple data streams. Iterative SINR Waterfilling provides better performance than Iterative Power Waterfilling in the scenario of high interference, while Iterative Power Waterfilling can work under multiple data streams. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with other waveform designs such as zero-forcing and conventional time-reversal waveform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377489/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250960","volume":"12","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Waveform Design for Sum Rate Optimization in Time-Reversal Multiuser Downlink Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimal Waveform Design for Sum Rate Optimization in Time-Reversal Multiuser Downlink Systems","sourcePdf":"346-tw1301-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118193S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6377489","onlineDate":"10 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377525,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This is an approach that combines the global search ability of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the local search ability of Adaptive Plan (AP). The APGA differs from GAs in handling design variable vectors (DVs). GAs generally encode DVs into genes and handle them through GA operators. However, the APGA encodes control variable vectors (CVs) of AP, which searches for local optimum, into its genes. CVs determine the global behavior of AP, and DVs are handled by AP in the optimization process of APGA. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Adaptive Plan System of swarm intelligent using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Genetic Algorithm (PSO-APGA) to solve a huge scale optimization problem, and to improve the convergence towards the optimal solution. The PSO-APGA is applied to several benchmark functions with multi-dimensions to evaluate its performance.We confirmed satisfactory performance through various benchmark tests.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377695.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377695","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive system of swarm intelligent with Genetic Algorithm for global optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive system of swarm intelligent with Genetic Algorithm for global optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377695/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377695/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191629","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive system of swarm intelligent with Genetic Algorithm for global optimization","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0017103003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072996S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377713,"authors":[{"name":"Dean J.

These abnormalities can be analyzed by an electrocardiogram (ECG). Details from this electrical signal can be used to classify what type of arrhythmia, if any, the patient has by analyzing the PQRST wave properties. The arrhythmias analyzed for this study are Bundle Branch Block, Supraventricular Tachycardia, Ventricular Tachycardia, Tachycardia, and Bradycardia. Multiple data samples of normal ECG characteristics also were read by an artificial neural network (ANN) and analyzed for the differences between a normal signal and an irregular signal. The data was extracted from the MIT-BIH Supraventricular database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. A typical method used to analyze cardiac arrhythmias is to take the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signal. In this study, an alternate method is used to predict cardiac arrhythmias. A neural network is designed and programmed with this data and then tested to validate the data set. The pattern recognition tool in MATLAB is then used to analyze and predict the data. The program results were tested to validate the data set. The ANN achieved 98.6% accuracy on the test data. The findings and outcome probabilities from this study are more accurate than some current methods of analysis used today. When neural networks are further used to analyze and test medical data samples, the medical community and patients will experience improvements in the diagnosis of heart abnormalities and early detection of debilitating medical conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377734","startPage":"402","endPage":"407","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and

information about the object of interest. Today, automated highway systems (AHS) for urban and highway environment were developed without the use of a stereo vision system. In future, the application of AHS should be extended to unstructured environments (e.g. desert) and be adapted to heterogeneous vehicles. In this context, the stereo vision system could enable the platoon to be independent from environmental structure (e.g. lane markings) through its ability to detect, track, locate and recognize heterogeneous vehicles. So far, the need for high accuracy prevents SVS to be applied in automated heterogeneous platoon. In this paper a mechanism towards this is presented, where some behavioral properties have to be satisfied in terms of unstructured environment and heterogeneous platoons. Within a heterogeneous platoon, the back view of a preceding vehicle (BVPV) is considered as a reference point for the lateral and longitudinal control. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to confirm that the distance of the BVPV can be extracted without depending on the movement of the preceding vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism has to ensure that features extracted from the back view are suitable to implement successfully the calibration process at around 10m distance. With the proposed SVS mechanism some of behavioral properties have to be satisfied in terms of unstructured environment and AHS. These properties are reliability, performance and robustness. Compared to other methods which use a SVS, the proposed mechanism distinguishes itself through adapting to dynamic environment and extracting the necessary features for the calibration process.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377761","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377761.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","startPage":"425","endPage":"432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mechanism to improve Stereo Vision Systems in automated heterogeneous platoons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A mechanism to improve Stereo Vision Systems in automated heterogeneous platoons","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377761/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191671","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377761/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mechanism to improve Stereo Vision Systems in automated heterogeneous platoons","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0042503071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072825S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6377776,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbing Yu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science & Information Technology Austin Peay State University, Clarksville, Tennessee, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbing","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086662254"},{"name":"Han Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Mathematics & Statistics Minnesota State University, Mankato Mankato, Minnesota, USA"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086663708"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6377776","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"abstract":"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing new data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse IDSs) or to a model of normal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - na\u00efve Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201canomalous\u201d to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377776.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"517","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly intrusion detection based upon data mining techniques and fuzzy logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Hidden Markov models","Data mining","Data models","Monitoring","Training data","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","fuzzy logic","pattern classification","probability","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly intrusion detection approach","data mining technique","fuzzy logic","misuse IDS","anomaly-based IDS","naive Bayes classification","input event classification","system call sequence","probability","false alarm rate","intrusion trace"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Intrusion Detection","Data Mining","Na\u00efve Bayes Classifiers","Fuzzy Logic","System Calls","Privileged Processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly intrusion detection based upon data mining techniques and fuzzy logic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191686","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly intrusion detection based upon data mining techniques and fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0051403125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039178S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377779,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Sano","affiliation":["Dept.

which appears naturally as short-range-dependent sequence recognition problems. But the structure of HMM limits the usage of global knowledge including the sentiment analysis of the text, which has become an increasingly popular research topic in NLP now. In this paper, we propose a novel treatment of HMM model to use the result of sentimental subjectivity analysis in syntactic level task, i.e. part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The subjectivity information is introduced as a pre-classification procedure into the interval-type HMM. The subjectivity degree of the testing sentence is used as a combination factor to choose an appropriate value from the interval. Experiments results on public tagging data sets shows that the proposed approach enhanced the performance of POS tagging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twitter part-of-speech tagging using pre-classification Hidden Markov model","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377881","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377881.pdf","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Twitter part-of-speech tagging using pre-classification Hidden Markov model","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377881/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191791","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twitter part-of-speech tagging using pre-classification Hidden Markov model","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0111803270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087626S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377903,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Wu","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"38529378000"},{"name":"Maolin Tang","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276097900"},{"name":"Warren Fraser","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Warren","lastName":"Fraser","id":"38529055200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6377903","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":665},"abstract":"Improving energy efficiency has become increasingly important in data centers in recent years to reduce the rapidly growing tremendous amounts of electricity consumption. The power dissipation of the physical servers is the root cause of power usage of other systems, such as cooling systems. Many efforts have been made to make data centers more energy efficient. One of them is to minimize the total power consumption of these servers in a data center through virtual machine consolidation, which is implemented by virtual machine placement. The placement problem is often modeled as a bin packing problem. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, heuristic solutions such as First Fit and Best Fit algorithms have been often used and have generally good results. However, their performance leaves room for further improvement. In this paper we propose a Simulated Annealing based algorithm, which aims at further improvement from any feasible placement. This is the first published attempt of using SA to solve the VM placement problem to optimize the power consumption. Experimental results show that this SA algorithm can generate better results, saving up to 25 percentage more energy than First Fit Decreasing in an acceptable time frame.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics

population-based optimization technique. Since, in the PSO, the exploration ability is important to find a desirable solution, various kinds of methods have been investigated to improve it. In this paper, we propose a PSO with a new chaotic system derived from the steepest descent method for a virtual quartic objective function with perturbations having global minima at the personal and global bests obtained by particles so far, where elements of each particle's position are updated by the proposed chaotic system or the standard update formula. Thus, the proposed PSO can search for solutions around the personal and global bests intensively without being trapped at any local minimum due to the chaoticness. Moreover, we show approximately the sufficient condition of parameter values of the proposed system under which the system is chaotic. Through computational experiments, we verify the performance of the proposed PSO by applying it to some global optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377918","startPage":"1333","endPage":"1338","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377918.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic particle swarm optimization with an intensive search around the personal and global bests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377918/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chaotic particle swarm optimization with an intensive search around the personal and global bests","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377918/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13191828","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic particle swarm optimization with an intensive search around the personal and global bests","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0133303043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102716S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377929,"authors":[{"name":"Zeratul Izzah Mohd Yusoh","affiliation":["Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Zeratul Izzah Mohd","lastName":"Yusoh","id":"38193137400"},{"name":"Maolin Tang","affiliation":["Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276097900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6377929","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377929","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Virtual machining","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","genetic algorithms","object-oriented programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["penalty-based grouping genetic algorithm","multiple composite SaaS components clustering","cloud data centre","software as a service","SaaS functions","resource allocation","data center resource management","placement reconfiguration","resource requirements","SLA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377929","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377929.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A penalty-based grouping genetic algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud","abstract":"Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud is getting more and more significant among software users and providers recently. A SaaS that is delivered as composite application has many benefits including reduced delivery costs, flexible offers of the SaaS functions and decreased subscription cost for users. However, this approach has introduced a new problem in managing the resources allocated to the composite SaaS. The resource allocation that has been done at the initial stage may be overloaded or wasted due to the dynamic environment of a Cloud. A typical data center resource management usually triggers a placement reconfiguration for the SaaS in order to maintain its performance as well as to minimize the resource used. Existing approaches for this problem often ignore the underlying dependencies between SaaS components. In addition, the reconfiguration also has to comply with SaaS constraints in terms of its resource requirements, placement requirement as well as its SLA. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a penalty-based Grouping Genetic Algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud. The main objective is to minimize the resource used by the SaaS by clustering its component without violating any constraint. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377929/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13191839","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377929/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A penalty-based grouping genetic algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A penalty-based grouping genetic algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0139603178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053448S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":6377940,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Dong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.

However, although utilizing virtualization can implement more efficient and flexible resource allocation, it may also come at the cost of increased system complexity and dynamics. In order to effectively adapt to performance fluctuations for ensuring high-performance, a generic approach to predict the performance influences of cloud platforms is highly desirable. To address this request, in this paper, the major factors that affect the performance of cloud and the relevant variation discipline are evaluated and analyzed thoroughly using a series of benchmarks in SEU (Southeast University) Cloud Computing Platform, where not only a general methodology on quantifying the performance influence but also the most important impact factors are proposed. Moreover, we use a real world application, as AMS experiment, to further evaluate the relevant performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and

factors, such as traffic congestion, vehicle accidents and road conditions. To improve the reliability, productivity and safety of the system, many researchers propose to use a wireless sensor network (WSN) as a solution. A WSN usually consists of many tiny sensor nodes for sensing, data processing and communication. In this study, we present the development of a small-sized, low-power and lightweight wireless sensor node. It is equipped with a 3-axes accelerometer, an altimeter sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, 315 MHz RF transceiver module and a typical coin-sized lithium battery (3.0 V, 220 mAh). The entire sensor node fits within a 28 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 8 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n volume and is only 7 grams (not including the antenna). An 8-bit MCU is included in the RF transceiver module to control sensor node operation. It collects and transmits sensors data in real time to the RF repeater with bit rate 24 kbps. During continuous operation, the sensor node consumes less than 3 mA current. Thus for a 220 mAh battery, the wireless sensor node can continue operating for more than 75 hours.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377955","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on

The system dynamics is described by working condition pattern moving rather than output equation or state space model. First, working condition data are collected around the nominal operating condition to construct \u201cpattern moving space\u201d. The space can be updated on-line. Then \u201cpattern class variable\u201d is defined in this space and the prediction model based on this new variable is also constructed. At last, the generalized predictive control method is also given. This method can identify the optimal controller's parameters directly by the prediction equations and input/output data. And it can avoid many intermediate operations for online solving Diophantine equations. Some simulations based on the actual run status data collected from sintering process of Anyang iron and steel plant are given to verify the effectiveness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377966","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377966.pdf","startPage":"1604","endPage":"1609","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven pattern moving and generalized predictive control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven pattern moving and generalized predictive control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191876","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377966/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven pattern moving and generalized predictive control","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0160401083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09199S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6377974,"authors":[{"name":"Erdal Kayacan","affiliation":["Division of Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS), Department of Biosystems (BIOSYST), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Kayacan","id":"37595300900"},{"name":"Erkan Kayacan","affiliation":["Division of Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS), Department of Biosystems (BIOSYST), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Kayacan","id":"38468023200"},{"name":"Herman Ramon","affiliation":["Division of Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS), Department of Biosystems (BIOSYST), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Ramon","id":"38292925800"},{"name":"Wouter Saeys","affiliation":["Division of Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS), Department of Biosystems (BIOSYST), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Saeys","id":"38468070500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6377974","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Agricultural machinery","Heuristic algorithms","PD control","Uncertainty","Tuning","Dynamics","Tires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agricultural machinery","control engineering computing","fuzzy neural nets","hydraulic systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","position control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust online learning algorithm","autonomous tractor","production machine","agriculture","agricultural machinery","machine size","energy cost","labor cost","energy use","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type-2 fuzzy neural network","sliding mode control theory-based learning algorithm","yaw dynamics control","hydraulic subsystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sliding mode control","type-2 fuzzy logic systems","type-2 fuzzy neural networks","autonomous tractor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377974","abstract":"Production machines, especially in agriculture, with higher efficiencies will be very important in the future because of the limited agricultural areas in the world and the high energy and labor costs. In order to increase the capacity of agricultural machinery, one can think to further increase the size of the machines. However, the limits in this direction will soon be reached as there is a maximum size to still allow road transport. On the other hand, energy costs are constantly increasing, such that the energy use should be minimized. A better option would be to use advanced learning algorithms, which can learn the system dynamics online, for the control of the production machines in order to increase their effectiveness. In this study, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type-2 fuzzy neural network with a sliding mode control theory-based learning algorithm is proposed for the control of the yaw dynamics of an autonomous tractor which includes various uncertainties, disturbances and nonlinearities, especially coming from the hydraulic sub systems. Experimental results show the efficacy and the efficiency of the proposed learning algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377974","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377974.pdf","startPage":"1652","endPage":"1657","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust on-line learning algorithm for type-2 fuzzy neural networks and its experimental evaluation on an autonomous tractor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A robust on-line learning algorithm for type-2 fuzzy neural networks and its experimental evaluation on an autonomous tractor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13218067","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6377974/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust on-line learning algorithm for type-2 fuzzy neural networks and its experimental evaluation on an autonomous tractor","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0165201139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100936S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6377976,"authors":[{"name":"Jamilson Dantas","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jamilson","lastName":"Dantas","id":"38529117700"},{"name":"Rubens Matos","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rubens","lastName":"Matos","id":"38241799700"},{"name":"Jean Araujo","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Araujo","id":"38231831600"},{"name":"Paulo Maciel","affiliation":["Informatics Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Maciel","id":"37266655800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6377976","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Mathematical model","Hardware","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["warm-standy replication mechanism","cloud computing services","customer confidence maintenance","revenue loss avoidance","SLA violation penalties","software components","hardware components","cloud infrastructures","limited reliability","fault tolerance mechanisms","dependability requirements","Eucalyptus cloud computing environment","nonredundant architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","availability","reliability","analytical models"]}],"abstract":"High availability in cloud computing services is essential for maintaining customer confidence and avoiding revenue losses due to SLA violation penalties. Since the software and hardware components of cloud infrastructures may have limited reliability, fault tolerance mechanisms are a means of achieving the necessary dependability requirements. This paper investigates the benefits of a warm-standy replication mechanism in a Eucalyptus cloud computing environment. A hierarchical heterogeneous modeling approach is used to represent a redundant architecture and compare its availability to that of a non-redundant architecture. Both hardware and software failures are considered in the proposed analytical models. The results show an enhanced dependability for the proposed redundant system, as well as a decrease in the annual downtime. The results also demonstrate that the simple replacement of hardware by more reliable machines would not produce improvements in system availability to the same extent as would the fault tolerant approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An availability model for eucalyptus platform: An analysis of warm-standy replication mechanism","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377976","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377976.pdf","startPage":"1664","endPage":"1669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6377976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An availability model for eucalyptus platform: An analysis of warm-standy replication mechanism","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377976/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191885","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An availability model for eucalyptus platform: An analysis of warm-standy replication mechanism","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0166401142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057712S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6377994,"authors":[{"name":"Walk\u00edria K.

Using a set of enzymes represented by Hydrolase, Isomerase, Ligase, Lyase, Transferase and Oxidoreductase classes, previously used by Dobson et al., this paper proposes a self-learning process able to predict their classes, based on their primary and secondary structures, through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and genetic algorithm. An SVM can be characterized as a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of resolving linear and non-linear classification problems. During the learning process, both the training data and the corresponding output are presented to the SVM to allow its parameters to be adjusted. This study utilized genetic algorithms - optimization heuristics often used to estimate parameters - to adjust the main parameters of the classifier such as kernel function type and parameter C, which provides the relationship between the training error and the margin of separation between classes. In this specific prediction problem, the results indicate that the best function is an RBF where width is 6.1 and C is 6.9. Using these parameters, the classifier obtains an average accuracy of 79.74%.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377994","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06377994.pdf","startPage":"1773","endPage":"1778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of support vector machine and genetic algorithms to predict protein function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"The use of support vector machine and genetic algorithms to predict protein function","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6377994/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191903","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6377994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of support vector machine and genetic algorithms to predict protein function","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0177301211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062938S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6377994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6378000,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liu","id":"38529203100"},{"name":"Haruhiko Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhiko","lastName":"Sato","id":"37596090500"},{"name":"Satoshi Oyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Oyama","id":"37297029600"},{"name":"Masahito Kurihara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Kurihara","id":"37272440700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378000","abstract":"Self-organizing neural network which is an unsupervised learning algorithm is to discover the inherent relationships of data.

systems","abstract":"The usefulness and ease of use of dashboards are essential elements in supporting interactive queries in data warehousing systems, as they provide the analysts the view of critical business metrics that reflect the business performance. However, on-demand dashboard development presents a challenging task for linking semantic equivalent data facts, discovering structural dependencies between and within data sources. In this paper, we introduce an improved approach for dashboard development that is supported by by-example framework and semantic-based data linkage management. In this Dashboard-by-example (DBE) framework, hypergraph-based techniques are adopted to acquire knowledge from heterogeneous and disparate data into homogeneous ontological clusters and partitions. Moreover, the use of hypergraph-guided data linkage provides multiple perspectives on the knowledge space, supporting interaction model to explore, contextualize and aggregate the data depending on the application needs. The applicability of our approach is discussed in a case study scenario, highlight the flexibility and efficiency in handling on-demand requirements in data warehousing systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378008/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191917","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dashboard by-example: A hypergraph-based approach to on-demand data warehousing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dashboard by-example: A hypergraph-based approach to on-demand data warehousing systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0185301210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048287S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378011,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Tsuda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Tsuda","id":"37086652286"},{"name":"Nguyen Ngoc Tan","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Nguyen Ngoc","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086657339"},{"name":"Masaki Samejima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaki","lastName":"Samejima","id":"37547218800"},{"name":"Masanori Akiyoshi","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Management, Hiroshima Institute of Technology, 2-1-1, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Akiyoshi","id":"37392865700"},{"name":"Norihisa Komoda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Norihisa","lastName":"Komoda","id":"37297121600"},{"name":"Matsuki Yoshino","affiliation":["IT Platform R & D Management Division, Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Matsuki","lastName":"Yoshino","id":"37086654933"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378011","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regression analysis","Correlation","Educational institutions","Electronic mail","Accuracy","Gaussian distribution","Trademarks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regression analysis","resource allocation","security of data","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection method","individual service","Web-based system","dummy variable selection","multiple regression analysis","resource usage estimation","regression coefficient","multiple correlation coefficient","anomaly time identification","anomaly service identification","precision rate","recall rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Multiple Regression Analysis","Correlation Coefficient","Dummy Variable"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses detecting anomalies of individual services from their total resource usage on web-based system. Because the total resource usage is a linear combination of the number of accesses to each service, multiple regression analysis can be applied to estimate a resource usage per an access to each service as regression coefficient. However, the regression coefficients differ from the resource usage per an access of the services, which is caused by unstable resource usage per an access. We propose a method based on a multiple correlation coefficient to identify anomaly time and anomaly services. The proposed method identifies anomaly time when the correlation coefficient is decreased. And the proposed method identifies the anomaly service by judging whether the correlation coefficient is increased or not after the selection of the dummy variable. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can identify all the anomaly time, and improves precision rate and recall rate of detecting anomaly services by 20% at least, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An anomaly detection method for individual service on web-based system by selection of dummy variables in multiple regression","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378011","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378011.pdf","startPage":"1873","endPage":"1877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An anomaly detection method for individual service on web-based system by selection of dummy variables in multiple regression","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378011/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191920","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An anomaly detection method for individual service on web-based system by selection of dummy variables in multiple regression","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0187301096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055797S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378035,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Araki","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Araki","id":"38082793500"},{"name":"Yuko Osana","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuko","lastName":"Osana","id":"37340856700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378035","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378035","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floors","Layout","Servers","Printers","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","office automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["office layout support system","polygonal space","interactive genetic algorithm","room arrangement plan","room arrangement plan generation","layout plan generation","square space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Office Layout","Interactive Genetic Algorithm","Polygonal Floor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378035","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378035.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","startPage":"2020","endPage":"2025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Office layout support system for polygonal space using interactive genetic algorithm \u2014 Generation of room arrangement plans \u2014","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an office layout support system for polygonal space using interactive genetic algorithm.

Therefore, it can be effectively used in the analysis of images processing area. However, the direct computation of discrete orthogonal TT is very expensive. In this study, we introduce a new framework for TT based on the discrete Tchebichef polynomials and develop a new block-based directional Tchebichef transforms (BDTT) to compensate for the defects of the direct computation TT in the application of image description. Moreover, this new algorithm is integrated into the compressed sensing (CS). By choosing the best directional mode of TT, the proposed methods simultaneous realizes sampling, compression of image, and better image description. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378068","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","startPage":"2207","endPage":"2212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-based compressed sensing of image using directional Tchebichef transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block-based compressed sensing of image using directional Tchebichef transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378068/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191976","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-based compressed sensing of image using directional Tchebichef transforms","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0220702076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057377S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378072,"authors":[{"name":"Wigrai Thanadechteemapat","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Wigrai","lastName":"Thanadechteemapat","id":"37548058500"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378072","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tag clouds","Data mining","Feature extraction","Dictionaries","Compounds","Accuracy","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data visualisation","information retrieval","natural language processing","Web sites","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic content extraction","automatic content visualization","Thai Web sites","information representation","information overload issue","Thai word segmentation","Thai language","Web page","Thai tag clouds","content body","content title","readability improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thai tag cloud","Web Content Extraction","Thai Word Segmentation","Keyword Extraction","Maximum Term Frequency"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an integrated approach to automatically provide an overview of content on Thai websites based on tag cloud.

This process is time-consuming and can take several minutes to acquire one image. The aim of this research is to reduce the imaging process time of MRI. This issue is addressed by reducing the number of acquired measurements using theory of Compressive Sensing (CS). Compressive Sensing exploits sparsity in MR images. Randomly under sampled k-space generates incoherent noise which can be handled using a nonlinear image reconstruction method. In this paper, a new framework is presented based on the idea to exploit non-uniform nature of sparsity in MR images, where local sparsity constrains were used instead of traditional global constraint, to further reduce the sample set. Experimental results and comparison with CS using global constraint are demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378076.pdf","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2258","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-uniform sparsity in rapid compressive sensing MRI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Coils","Transforms","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid compressive sensing MRI","magnetic resonance imaging","imaging process time reduction","compressive sensing theory","CS theory","nonuniform MR image sparsity","nonlinear image reconstruction","sampled k-space","incoherent noise generation","local sparsity constrains","sample set reduction","global constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Compressive Sensing","Sparse Signals","Fourier Transform","Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR)","L1 Minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Non-uniform sparsity in rapid compressive sensing MRI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378076/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191984","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-uniform sparsity in rapid compressive sensing MRI","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0225302131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081269S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378082,"authors":[{"name":"Erzhong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Interaction Technologies, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Erzhong","lastName":"Hu","id":"38529383300"},{"name":"Hirokazu Nosato","affiliation":["Information Technology Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirokazu","lastName":"Nosato","id":"37323711000"},{"name":"Hidenori Sakanashi","affiliation":["Information Technology Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidenori","lastName":"Sakanashi","id":"37284044400"},{"name":"Masahiro Murakawa","affiliation":["Information Technology Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Murakawa","id":"37323710400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378082","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":199},"abstract":"Capsule endoscopy is a painless way more and more utilized in gastrointestinal examination.

Simulation results are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed model predictive control method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378129","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378129.pdf","startPage":"2551","endPage":"2556","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive control of autonomous underwater vehicles based on the simplified dual neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive control of autonomous underwater vehicles based on the simplified dual neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13192037","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378129/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive control of autonomous underwater vehicles based on the simplified dual neural network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0255103164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090298S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6378133,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Gyu Kim","affiliation":["KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han-Gyu","lastName":"Kim","id":"38529375800"},{"name":"Jeong-Sik Park","affiliation":["Mokwon University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Sik","lastName":"Park","id":"37539657000"},{"name":"Gil-Jin Jang","affiliation":["UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gil-Jin","lastName":"Jang","id":"38236152400"},{"name":"Yung-Hwan Oh","affiliation":["KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yung-Hwan","lastName":"Oh","id":"37275413000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1714-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1713-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1712-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"6378133","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","probability","speech processing","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering","sigmoidal weight update","speech pitch correction","pitch track correction technique","sigmoidal objective function","autocorrelation function","pitch streak","pitch correction error","importance weight computation","foreground streams","estimated pitch value similarity","subband signal","sigmoid transfer function","probability value","speech segregation","noise source","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","energy loss ratio","noise residue ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech segregation","Pitch track correction","Particle filtering"]}],"abstract":"We propose a pitch track correction technique using a sigmoidal objective function in a particle filtering framework. The conventional method for pitch track correction simply considers the peak locations of the autocorrelation functions as the pitch values and depends only on the longest reliable pitch streak. This constraint may induce pitch correction errors. The proposed approach uses particle filtering to further correctly track the pitch values. To apply the particle filtering algorithm to pitch track correction, a method for the importance weight computation using a sigmoidal function on foreground streams is proposed. The similarity between the the estimated pitch values and the subband signals are computed, and a sigmoid transfer function is used to convert it as a probability value. To verify the efficiency of our proposed approach, we carried out speech segregation experiments for mixtures of speech and various noise sources in various mixing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). With respect to several performance measures including SNR, energy loss ratio, and noise residue ratio of the segregated speech, the proposed method achieved superior performance compared to the conventional approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle filtering by sigmoidal weight update for speech pitch correction","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378133","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378133.pdf","startPage":"2574","endPage":"2579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Particle filtering by sigmoidal weight update for speech pitch correction","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378133/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192041","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle filtering by sigmoidal weight update for speech pitch correction","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0257403215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066476S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6378136,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Xing Wen","affiliation":["Department of Computer and information science, FST, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Xing","lastName":"Wen","id":"38030005300"},{"name":"C.L.

For evaluating actual nursing-care process, freestyle Japanese texts which are called \u201cnursing-care texts\u201d are collected through the Internet. The nursing-care experts read the collected nursing-care texts carefully to evaluate actual nursing-care process. Then they make a recommendation which includes some improvements, and send it to each nurse. The number of nursing-care experts who can evaluate the nursing-care texts is a few. Hence, it is hard to perform the above mentioned evaluation process because of a large number of nurses. In order to assist nursing-care experts in evaluating the nursing-care texts, we have been developing a computer aided nursing-care text classification system. In this paper, first, we introduce our computer aided nursing-care text classification system. Then we propose a method to improve the classification performance of the nursing-care text classification system. In our proposed method, dependency relation between terms is extracted from the nursing-care text. The extracted dependency is used as a feature value which represents characteristics of each nursing-care text. From some experimental results for the actual nursing-care text sets, we show that our proposed feature definition is effective for improving the classification performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192048","htmlLink":"/document/6378140/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New feature definition for improvement of Nursing-care text classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New feature definition for improvement of Nursing-care text classification","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0261002162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045936S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378157,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Many research efforts have been fixated on the development of computerized recognition and classification systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns. Automatic computerized Gleason grading methods can be classified into two basic classes: image textural-based class and tissue structural-based (nuclear architecture, gland morphology) class. To the best of our knowledge, tissue structural classification based on three-class classification results including Gleason grade 3, 4 and 5 carcinoma were not reported. The goal of this article is to: (1) develop computerized assessment support systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns 3, 4 and 5 by integrating gland morphology and architectural features; (2) improve classification accuracy especially between intermediate Gleason grades 3 and 4. Computer simulations show an average correct classification accuracy of 97.63%, 96.57% and 87.30% when distinguishing Gleason 3 vs. Gleason 4, Gleason 3 vs. Gleason 5, and Gleason 4 vs. Gleason 5 respectively. These results lead the way towards providing an effective and promising software tool in automatic prostate cancer histological Gleason grading.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378181","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2854","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics

SRAM start-up behavior for Physical Unclonable Functions","abstract":"One of the emerging technologies for cryptographic key storage is hardware intrinsic security based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs); a PUF is a physical structure of a device that is hard to clone due to its inherent, device-unique and deep-submicron process variations. SRAM PUF is an example of such technology that is becoming popular. So far, only a little is published about modeling and analysis of their start-up values (SUVs). Reproducing the same start-up behavior every time the chip is powered-on is crucial to produce the same cryptographic key. This paper presents an analytical model for SUVs of an SRAM PUF based on Static Noise Margin (SNM), and reports some industrial measurements to validate the model. Simulation of the impact of different sensitivity parameters (such as variation in power supply, temperature, transistor geometry) has been performed. The results show that out of all sensitivity parameters, variation in threshold voltage is the one with the highest impact. Industrial measurements on real memory devices validate the simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378190/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378190/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13174578","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling SRAM start-up behavior for Physical Unclonable Functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling SRAM start-up behavior for Physical Unclonable Functions","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"rp02015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074181S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362314","isNumber":"6378188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362314","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6378188","articleId":"6378190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378191,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Huang","id":"37402214100"},{"name":"John M Carulli","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"John M","lastName":"Carulli","id":"37391869200"},{"name":"Yiorgos Makris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Makris","id":"37274481400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3044-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3043-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3042-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6378191","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":567},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Integrated circuits","Aging","Degradation","Reliability","Kernel","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","circuit analysis computing","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit testing","support vector machines","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric counterfeit IC detection","support vector machines","counterfeit integrated circuits","SVM","one-class SVM classifier","transistor aging","IC behavior","parametric measurements","fabricated devices","aging degradation","parametric burn-in test analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Counterfeit IC detection","one-class SVM classifier","parametric burn-in test"]}],"abstract":"We present a method to detect a common type of counterfeit Integrated Circuits (ICs), namely used ones, from their brand new counterparts using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Reports show that recovered ICs contribute to about 80% of all counterfeit ICs in the market today. Such ICs are recovered from scrapped boards of used devices. Identification of such counterfeit ICs is a great challenge since these ICs have an identical appearance, functionality, and package as fresh ICs. In this paper, a novel path-delay fingerprinting technique is proposed to distinguish recovered ICs from fresh ICs. Due to degradation in the field, the path delay distribution of recovered ICs will become different from that found in fresh ICs. Statistical data analysis can effectively separate the impact of process variations from aging effects on path delay. Simulation results of benchmark circuits using 45 nm technology demonstrate the efficiency of this technique for recovered IC identification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path-delay fingerprinting for identification of recovered ICs","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2012.6378192","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362314/6378188/06378192.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2012.6378192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378188","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Path-delay fingerprinting for identification of recovered ICs","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378192/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13174580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path-delay fingerprinting for identification of recovered ICs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"rp04042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088049S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362314","isNumber":"6378188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362314","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6378188","articleId":"6378192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378197,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Da Rolt","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS UMR 5506, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Da Rolt","id":"37704593600"},{"name":"Amitabh Das","affiliation":["ESAT/SCD-COSIC and IBBT, KU Leuven, Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Amitabh","lastName":"Das","id":"38240663900"},{"name":"Giorgio Di Natale","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS UMR 5506, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Di Natale","id":"37647408100"},{"name":"Mane-Lise Flottes","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS UMR 5506, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Mane-Lise","lastName":"Flottes","id":"37273347100"},{"name":"Bruno Rouzeyre","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS UMR 5506, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Rouzeyre","id":"37273347500"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["ESAT/SCD-COSIC and IBBT, KU Leuven, Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3044-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3043-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3042-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6378197","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Very large scale integration","Nanotechnology","Discrete Fourier transforms","Elliptic curve cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scan-based attack","elliptic curve cryptosystems","industrial design-for-testability structures","ECC","X-masking","partial scan","leakage analysis","DfT structures","word length 192 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scan-based attacks","Elliptic Curve Cryptography","Design-for-Testability","Montgomery Ladder","Test compression"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a scan-based attack on hardware implementations of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC).

For this reason, several works propose techniques to inject and evaluate faults affecting configuration bits. In this work, we propose a novel platform which requires a single FPGA to perform the fault injection, to apply input vectors and to evaluate the correctness of the outputs. It can evaluate complex fault models, such as multiple bit errors that are caused by a single bit flip. Furthermore, it occupies a small portion of the device resources and works at a very high speed, being able to inject and remove a fault in under 10\u03bcs.","doi":"10.1109/DFT.2012.6378216","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362314/6378188/06378216.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2012.6378216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast single-FPGA fault injection platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fast single-FPGA fault injection platform","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378216/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13174604","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast single-FPGA fault injection platform","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"rp28049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065467S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362314","isNumber":"6378188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362314","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6378188","articleId":"6378216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378229,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Acevedo","affiliation":["ECE Department, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Acevedo","id":"38529205900"},{"name":"Dimitri Kagaris","affiliation":["ECE Department, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Kagaris","id":"37282592800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3044-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3043-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3042-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"6378229","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"abstract":"In built-in test pattern generation, a test cube is usually encoded or compressed by a seed vector that is used as the initial state of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The seed vector is found by solving a linear system of equations using a fixed (but arbitrarily chosen) characteristic polynomial for the LFSR In contrast, finding the LFSR characteristic polynomial to generate a given test cube provides more design freedom but results in a non-linear system of equations. In this paper, we address the latter problem using the Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithm. The BM algorithm is very efficient and obviates the need of solving a non-linear system, but it cannot work with don't care values. We present therefore a procedure that assigns the don't cares in a given test cube in such a way so as to minimize the resulting polynomial found by BM. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial improvement over a previous technique that assigns the don't cares greedily.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Very large scale integration","Nanotechnology","Discrete Fourier transforms","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","built-in self test","logic testing","polynomials","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","LFSR characteristic polynomials","TPG","built-in test pattern generation","linear feedback shift register","seed vector","BM algorithm","nonlinear equation system","test cube","fixed characteristic polynomial","linear equation system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT.2012.6378229","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362314/6378188/06378229.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT.2012.6378229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to obtain LFSR characteristic polynomials for TPG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to obtain LFSR characteristic polynomials for TPG","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378229/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378229/","accessionNumber":"13174617","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to obtain LFSR characteristic polynomials for TPG","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"rp41036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060538S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362314","isNumber":"6378188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362314","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6378188","articleId":"6378229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378235,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00e9ricles B.

However, adjustments on its model are essentials to the SVM work well. Optimization techniques have been used to automatize this process finding suitable configurations of parameters which attends some learning problems. This work utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) applied to the SVM parameter selection problem. As the learning systems are essentially a multi-objective problem, a multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) was used to maximize the success rate and minimize the number of support vectors of the model. Nevertheless, we propose the combination of Meta-Learning (ML) with a modified MOPSO which uses the crowding distance mechanism (MOPSO-CDR). In this combination, solutions provided by ML are possibly located in good regions in the search space. Hence, using a reduced number of successful candidates, the search process would converge faster and be less expensive. In our work, we implemented a prototype in which MOPSO-CDR was used to select the values of two SVM parameters for classification problems. In the performed experiments, the proposed solution (MOPSO-CDR using ML) was compared to the MOPSO-CDR with random initialization, obtaining pareto fronts with higher quality on a set of 40 classification problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378235","startPage":"2909","endPage":"2914","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362338/6377652/06378235.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining a multi-objective optimization approach with meta-learning for SVM parameter selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Measurement","Search problems","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization approach","metalearning","SVM parameter selection","support vector machines","supervised learning technique","particle swarm optimization","crowding distance mechanism","classification problem","random initialization","Pareto front"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Meta-Learning","Multi-Objective Optimization","SVM Parameter Selection","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Combining a multi-objective optimization approach with meta-learning for SVM parameter selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13192100","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining a multi-objective optimization approach with meta-learning for SVM parameter selection","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0290903219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069332S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362338","isNumber":"6377652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362338","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6377652","articleId":"6378235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6378262,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Xiang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37531342800"},{"name":"Yuichi Tazaki","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Tazaki","id":"37540738600"},{"name":"Tatsuya Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37276136600"},{"name":"B.

Experimental results show that the CWT analysis based on the complex Morlet wavelet improves classification accuracy as compared to the analysis based on STFT. More importantly, a 20\u00d7 reduction of the vector size requirement is shown, thus greatly lowering computational requirements.

Recent research into efficiently compressing sequence data has focused largely on improving compression ratios. Yet, the throughputs of current methods now lag far behind the I/O bandwidths of modern storage systems. As biologists move their analyses to high-performance systems with greater I/O bandwidth, low-throughput compression becomes a limiting factor. To address this gap, we present a new storage model called SeqDB, which offers high-throughput compression of sequence data with minimal sacrifice in compression ratio. It achieves this by combining the existing multithreaded Blosc compressor with a new data-parallel byte-packing scheme, called SeqPack, which interleaves sequence data and quality scores.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2012.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6517419","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/6517419/06378359.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Throughput Compression of FASTQ Data with SeqDB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378359/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Throughput Compression of FASTQ Data with SeqDB","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13528395","pubMedId":"23702558","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Throughput Compression of FASTQ Data with SeqDB","sourcePdf":"ttb2013010213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035843S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"6517419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6517419","articleId":"6378359","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378370,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Lu","id":"37557818500"},{"name":"Dingding Li","affiliation":["Economics Department, University of Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Dingding","lastName":"Li","id":"37074404100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-4347"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2191"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3865"}],"articleNumber":"6378370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1826},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Estimation","Sociology","Statistics","Mathematical model","Twitter","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","sampling methods","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["big data","population size estimation","online social networks","OSN","uniform random sampling","simple random walk","bias correction estimator","Twitter network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big data","online social networks","small sample","bias","size estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378370","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2012.220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2012.220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6604395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6604395/06378370.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bias Correction in a Small Sample from Big Data","abstract":"This paper discusses the bias problem when estimating the population size of big data such as online social networks (OSN) using uniform random sampling and simple random walk. Unlike the traditional estimation problem where the sample size is not very small relative to the data size, in big data, a small sample relative to the data size is already very large and costly to obtain. We point out that when small samples are used, there is a bias that is no longer negligible.

Such trajectories exhibit complex spatial patterns and have well defined destinations with long-range dependencies implying that Markov (random-walk) models are unsuitable. How can estimated target tracks be used to detect anomalous trajectories such as circling a building or going past a sequence of checkpoints? This paper develops context-free grammar models and reciprocal Markov models (one dimensional Markov random fields) for modeling spatial trajectories with a known end point. The intent of a target is assumed to be a function of the shape of the trajectory it follows and its intended destination. The stochastic grammar models developed are concerned with trajectory shape classification while the reciprocal Markov models are used for destination prediction.

Thus, to successfully coexist, cognitive users must have awareness of PUs presence in the vicinity. As most communication signals exhibit statistical periodicities, cyclostationary feature detection (CFD) can be used to perform the task of sensing the spectrum for PUs presence. A second-order statistical approach is most widely used to perform CFD in which a set of lags should be chosen for statistical testing. The optimal method for choosing multiple lags requires knowledge of the 4th-order cyclic cumulant of PUs' signals, which can be a burden in practice. In this letter, we present a new idea for lag set selection with which avoids the mentioned 4th-order cumulant burden. The results, verified via analysis and simulation, show that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to the optimal one in the low signal to-noise ratio region where it is most critical for CR applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378397/","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6378397/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13186897","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Multiple Lags Selection Method for Cyclostationary Feature Based Spectrum-Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Multiple Lags Selection Method for Cyclostationary Feature Based Spectrum-Sensing","sourcePdf":"lsp-shen-2233471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048686S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6380557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6380557","articleId":"6378397","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6378401,"authors":[{"name":"Ovidio Mario Bucci","affiliation":["DIET, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6493420/6378401/6378401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ovidio Mario Bucci (F'93) was born in Civitaquana, Italy, on November 18, 1943.

In particular, we introduce new figures of merit, particularly suitable for PWG synthesis procedures, and simple guidelines regarding size and shape of the PWG, as well as the number of radiating sources needed to synthesize the required plane waves. The performance limits of a PWG are analyzed, in terms of indexes related to the stability of the solution and to the level of the field amplitude on the lateral walls of the anechoic chamber in which the PWG is placed. Finally we present a synthesis method for PWGs, based on a planar sparse array architecture. Starting from the previously achieved results, a novel effective synthesis procedure is introduced. By means of such a procedure we are also able to take explicitly into account the mechanical and electrical tolerances in the PWG realization. In such a way we can assure the best performances, given the unavoidable errors in the positioning and excitation of the radiating elements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Shape","Geometry","Guidelines","Anechoic chambers","Bandwidth","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plane-wave generator synthesis","plane wave superposition","figures of merit","PWG synthesis procedures","field amplitude","anechoic chamber","planar sparse antenna array architecture","electrical tolerances","mechanical tolerances","radiating elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","antenna measurements","near field"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2233453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6493420/06378401.pdf","startPage":"2005","endPage":"2018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6493420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2233453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plane-Wave Generators: Design Guidelines, Achievable Performances and Effective Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Plane-Wave Generators: Design Guidelines, Achievable Performances and Effective Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378401/","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378401/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13413065","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plane-Wave Generators: Design Guidelines, Achievable Performances and Effective Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tap-migliore-2233453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09232S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6493420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6493420","articleId":"6378401","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378408,"authors":[{"name":"Rosa Maria Cavalli","affiliation":["CNR-IIA Institute of Atmospheric Pollution Research, Monte Rotondo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6516025/6378408/6378408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rosa Maria Cavalli received the M.Sc. degree in geological science from \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d, Rome, Italy, in 1990.","She is currently a researcher with the Institute for the Atmospheric Pollution, Italian National Research Council.

In the literature, the NLPCA was used to decorrelate the information related to a hyperspectral image. The resulting nonlinear principal components (NLPCs) contain information related to different land cover types and biophysical properties, such as vegetation coverage or soil wetness. From this point of view, NLPCA applied to airborne hyperspectral data was exploited to test their effectiveness and capability in highlighting the anomalies related to buried archaeological structures. Each component obtained from the NLPCA has been interpreted in order to assess any tonal anomalies. As a matter of a fact, since every analyzed component exhibited anomalies different in terms of size and intensity, the Separability Index (SI) was applied for measuring the tonal difference of the anomalies with respect to the surrounding area. SI has been evaluated for determining the potential of anomalies detection in each component. The airborne Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) images, collected over the archaeological Park of Selinunte, were analyzed for this purpose. In this area, the presence of remains, not yet excavated, was reported by archaeologists. A previous analysis of this image, carried out to highlight the buried structures, appear to match the archaeological prospection. The results obtained by the present work demonstrate that the use of the NLPCA technique, compared to previous approaches emphasizes the ability of airborne hyperspectral images to identify buried structures. In particular, the adopted data processing flow chart (i.e., NLPCA and SI techniques, data resampling criteria and anomaly evaluations criteria) applied to MIVIS airborne hyperspectral data, collected over Selinunte Archaeological Park, highlighted the ability of the NLPCA technique in emphasizing the anomalies related to the presence of buried structure.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2227301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6516025/06378408.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2227301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Anomalies Produced by Buried Archaeological Structures Using Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis Applied to Airborne Hyperspectral Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378408/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Anomalies Produced by Buried Archaeological Structures Using Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis Applied to Airborne Hyperspectral Image","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13499713","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378408/","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Anomalies Produced by Buried Archaeological Structures Using Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis Applied to Airborne Hyperspectral Image","sourcePdf":"jstars-licciardi-2227301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133571S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6516025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6516025","articleId":"6378408","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378410,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","RaSS National Laboratory, CNIT, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6414699/6378410/6378410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filippo Costa (S'07\u2013M'10) was born in Pisa, Italy, on October 31, 1980.

The structure is based on a finite metallic frequency-selective surface (FSS) comprising 2 \u00d7 2 (30 mm \u00d7 30 mm) or 3 \u00d7 3 (45 mm \u00d7 45 mm) unit cells. The FSS unit cell is formed by several concentric square loop resonators. The thin structure performs deep absorptions of the impinging signal at several resonant frequencies related to the loop resonators. If one of the printed loops in the unit cell is removed, the corresponding absorption peak disappears from the reflected signal giving the possibility of encoding a desired bit sequence. The proposed structure exhibits some intrinsic advantages, such as scalability (bit number increase) without any size increase, polarization independence, large read range, and the capability of operating when mounted on metallic objects. A transmission line model is employed to illustrate the operation principle of the structure, whereas measurements on realized prototypes are provided to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Chipless RFID Based on Multiresonant High-Impedance Surfaces","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2227777","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6414699/06378410.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2227777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6414699","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Chipless RFID Based on Multiresonant High-Impedance Surfaces","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6378410/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13244782","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Chipless RFID Based on Multiresonant High-Impedance Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tmtt-costa-2227777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086008S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6414699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6414699","articleId":"6378410","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378415,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Hao Teng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jen-Hao Teng (SM'11) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1991, 1993, and 1996, respectively.","He was with I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, from 1998 to 2010.

The optimal PEV-charging selection problem requires an exhaustive search for all possible combinations of PEVs in a power system, which cannot be solved for the practical number of PEVs. Inspired by the efficiency of the convex relaxation optimization tool in finding close-to-optimal results in huge search spaces, this paper proposes the application of the convex relaxation optimization method to solve the PEV-charging selection problem. Compared with the results of the uncontrolled case, the simulated results indicate that the proposed PEV-charging selection algorithm only slightly reduces user convenience levels, but significantly mitigates the impact of the PEV-charging on the power system. We also develop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the PEV-charging selection problem in a decentralized manner, i.e., the binary charging decisions (charged or not charged) are made locally by each vehicle. Using the proposed distributed optimization algorithm, each vehicle is only required to report its power demand rather than report several of its private user state information, mitigating the security problems inherent in such problem. The proposed decentralized algorithm only requires low-speed communication capability, making it suitable for real-time implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2217761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2217761","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06378416.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Plug-in Electric Vehicle Charging Selection Algorithm in Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Plug-in Electric Vehicle Charging Selection Algorithm in Power Systems","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13191001","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378416/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Plug-in Electric Vehicle Charging Selection Algorithm in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-chen-2217761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087167S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6378416","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6378417,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei He","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dawei He (S'10) was born in Jilin Province of China.

The prior-knowledge includes front-end power supply circuit identification, electrical operating principle, and customer usage. The focus of this paper is on a comprehensive study on front-end power supply circuit topologies and on the commercial power supply market. The former forms the basis of the proposed hierarchical taxonomy from the power electronics' point of view, and the latter study guarantees that the proposed taxonomy represents the majority of appliance loads in the real world. Under the proposed taxonomy, the advantage of the model-driven hierarchical feature extraction is discussed, and initial analysis shows that optimized features can be obtained from this method, which drives a much simpler AND more feasible solution in differentiating the subtle differences between similar loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378417/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Front-End Electronic Circuit Topology Analysis for Model-Driven Classification and Monitoring of Appliance Loads in Smart Buildings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Front-End Electronic Circuit Topology Analysis for Model-Driven Classification and Monitoring of Appliance Loads in Smart Buildings","sourcePdf":"tsg-he-2219327-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06941S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6378417","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378419,"authors":[{"name":"Baochao Wang","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Compi\u00e9gne, Compiegne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6397636/6378419/6378419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Baochao Wang (S'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

The paper focuses on power balancing, with load shedding and PV constrained production, and takes into account the grid availability and grid vulnerability by smart grid messages. The system behavior modeling by MATLAB Stateflow leads to the whole control strategy design, which concerns the power balancing and imposed power limits by the utility grid, while providing interface for energy management. Experimental results evaluate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. As further development of this control design, an intelligent multi-layer supervision is suggested. This supervision, able to exchange data with the smart grid, deals with the end-user demand, forecast of photovoltaic production, prediction of load consumption, and energy management. The major technical contribution of this paper is linked to the proposed control design that permits better DC microgrid integration (avoids undesired injection, mitigates fluctuations in grid power, reduces grid peak consumption) and provides possibility to reduce the negative impact on the utility grid thanks to the supervision interface. The power balancing control interface provides possibility for advanced energy management with low speed communication.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2012.2217764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6397636/06378419.pdf","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2012.2217764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent DC Microgrid With Smart Grid Communications: Control Strategy Consideration and Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent DC Microgrid With Smart Grid Communications: Control Strategy Consideration and Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378419/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13191003","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378419/","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent DC Microgrid With Smart Grid Communications: Control Strategy Consideration and Design","sourcePdf":"tsg-sechilariu-2217764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097307S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6397636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6397636","articleId":"6378419","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6378436,"authors":[{"name":"Dorin Bibicu","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences and Environment, Physics Department, Dunarea de Jos University of Galati, Galati, Romania"],"firstName":"Dorin","lastName":"Bibicu","id":"38234736900"},{"name":"Luminita Moraru","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences and Environment, Physics Department, Dunarea de Jos University of Galati, Galati, Romania"],"firstName":"Luminita","lastName":"Moraru","id":"37587478100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6378436","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":697},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378436","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Noise","Image edge detection","Noise reduction","Artificial neural networks","Image segmentation","Heart"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["echocardiography","feature extraction","image classification","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets","random noise","volume measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiac cycle phase estimation","2D echocardiographic images","cardiac volume estimation","atrial systole event","atrial diastole event","mitral valve geometrical position","image features","image processing methods","artificial neural networks","ANN classifier","anatomical information extraction","denoising scenario","Gaussian noise","Rayleigh noise distribution","hybrid algorithm","segmentation process","computer aided diagnosis software","CADi software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","cardiac cycle","computer-aided diagnosis","image features"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Echocardiography","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Myocardial Contraction","Myocardial Infarction","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2231864","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6502208/06378436.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6502208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2231864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cardiac Cycle Phase Estimation in 2-D Echocardiographic Images Using an Artificial Neural Network","abstract":"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach to estimate the cardiac cycle phases in 2-D echocardiographic images as a first step in cardiac volume estimation. We focused on analyzing the atrial systole and diastole events by using the geometrical position of the mitral valve and a set of three image features. The proposed algorithm is based on a tandem of image processing methods and artificial neural networks as a classifier to robustly extract anatomical information. An original set of image features is proposed and derived to recognize the cardiac phases. The aforementioned approach is performed in two denoising scenarios. In the first scenario, the images are corrupted with Gaussian noise, and in the second one with Rayleigh noise distribution. Our hybrid algorithm does not involve any manual tracing of the boundaries for segmentation process. The algorithm is implemented as computer-aided diagnosis (CADi) software. A dataset of 150 images that include both normal and infarct cardiac pathologies was used. We reported an accuracy of 90 % and a 2 \u00b1 0.3 s in terms of execution time of CADi application in a cardiac cycle estimation task. The main contribution of this paper is to propose this hybrid method and a set of image features that can be helpful for automatic detection applications without any user intervention. The results of the employed methods are qualitatively and quantitatively compared in terms of efficiency for both scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13730168","pubMedId":"23247838","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6378436/","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cardiac Cycle Phase Estimation in 2-D Echocardiographic Images Using an Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cardiac Cycle Phase Estimation in 2-D Echocardiographic Images Using an Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tbme-moraru-2231864-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064769S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6502208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6502208","articleId":"6378436","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6378441,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Ozen","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Ozen","id":"37948688900"},{"name":"Rik Jos","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Rik","lastName":"Jos","id":"37399348400"},{"name":"Christian Fager","affiliation":["Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Fager","id":"37274803100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6378441","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1868},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Power generation","Zero voltage switching","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","wideband amplifiers","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous class-E power amplifier modes","class-E zero voltage-zero voltage derivative switching condition","arbitrarily selected reactive second harmonic switch impedance","higher-order harmonic currents","class-EF2 modes","robust waveform engineering","wideband class-E PA synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth","class E","harmonic tuning","waveform engineering","zero voltage switching (ZVS)"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a continuum of novel closed-form solutions is derived for class-E power amplifiers (PAs).

In this paper, we present a method for reconstructing the virtual frontal view from a given nonfrontal face image using Markov random fields (MRFs) and an efficient variant of the belief propagation algorithm. In the proposed approach, the input face image is divided into a grid of overlapping patches, and a globally optimal set of local warps is estimated to synthesize the patches at the frontal view. A set of possible warps for each patch is obtained by aligning it with images from a training database of frontal faces. The alignments are performed efficiently in the Fourier domain using an extension of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm that can handle illumination variations. The problem of finding the optimal warps is then formulated as a discrete labeling problem using an MRF. The reconstructed frontal face image can then be used with any face recognition technique. The two main advantages of our method are that it does not require manually selected facial landmarks or head pose estimation. In order to improve the performance of our pose normalization method in face recognition, we also present an algorithm for classifying whether a given face image is at a frontal or nonfrontal pose. Experimental results on different datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2233489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6449327/06378453.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2233489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6449327","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Markov Random Fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Markov Random Fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13306527","pubMedId":"23247858","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6378453/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Markov Random Fields","sourcePdf":"tip-ho-2233489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092375S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6449327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6449327","articleId":"6378453","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378475,"authors":[{"name":"Nghia Q.

This investigation was motivated by a finding that, since the test statistic of the ideal observer in sonography is a quadratic function of the echo data, it is not generally normally distributed. We found for some types of boundary discrimination tasks often required for sonographic lesion diagnosis, the deviation of the test statistic from a normal distribution can be significant. Hence the usual relationships between performance and information metrics become uncertain. Using Monte Carlo studies involving five common sonographic lesion-discrimination tasks, we found in each case that the detectability index \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dA</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n from receiver operating characteristic analysis was well approximated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">J</i>\n, a measure of clinical task information available from the recorded radio-frequency echo data.

Integration of a microfluidic chip and robotics based on microelectromechanical systems technology is a key challenge for biomedical innovations. In addition to the advantage of environmental control by a microfluidic chip, robots enable physical operations on the cell with high throughput. This paper presents high-speed microrobotic actuation driven by permanent magnets in a microfluidic chip. The developed microrobot has a milli-Newton-level output force from a permanent magnet, micrometer-level positioning accuracy, and drive speed of over 280 mm/s. The riblet surface, which is a regularly arrayed V-groove, reduces fluid friction and enables high-speed actuation. Ni and Si composite fabrication was employed to form the optimum riblet shape on the microrobot's surface by wet and dry etching. The evaluation experiments show that the microrobot can be actuated at a rate of up to 90 Hz, which is more than ten times higher than that of the microrobot without a riblet. Two distinguish applications of the developed microrobots were demonstrated in a microfluidic chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6491466/06378479.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2012.2228310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2012.2228310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6491466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Magnetic Microrobot Actuation in a Microfluidic Chip by a Fine V-Groove Surface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Friction","Robots","System-on-a-chip","Lubricants","Shape","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental factors","etching","medical robotics","microfluidics","micrometry","micropositioning","microrobots","Newton method","patient treatment","permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed magnetic microrobot actuation","microfluidic chip","fine V-groove surface","biological cell treatment","robotics","microelectromechanical systems technology","biomedical innovation","environmental control","physical operation","milliNewton-level output force","permanent magnet","micrometer-level positioning accuracy","drive speed","riblet surface","fluid friction","high-speed actuation","composite fabrication","optimum riblet shape","microrobot surface","wet etching","dry etching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Friction reduction","high speed","lab on a chip","magnetically driven microtool (MMT)","microfluidics","microrobot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Magnetic Microrobot Actuation in a Microfluidic Chip by a Fine V-Groove Surface","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6378479/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13413170","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Magnetic Microrobot Actuation in a Microfluidic Chip by a Fine V-Groove Surface","sourcePdf":"tro-hagiwara-2228310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097509S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6491466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6491466","articleId":"6378479","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378481,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6mer Bulakci","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland","Nokia Siemens Networks, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6514944/6378481/6378481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d6mer Bulakci (M\u201909) received the B.Sc. degree (with high honors) in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communications engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 2008.

Exploiting the deployment flexibility of RNs, relay site planning (RSP) can be utilized to overcome the limitations of the relay link. In particular, RSP is carried out by selecting RN deployment locations from a discrete set of alternatives considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on the relay link as the selection criterion. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for RSP that can be used for planning and dimensioning of two-hop cellular relay networks operating over composite fading/shadowing channels in the presence of cochannel interference. Nakagami-lognormal distribution is used to model the relay link, whereas the access link between a mobile terminal (MT) and its serving RN is modeled by Rician-lognormal distribution. As these composite models do not have closed-form distribution functions, we utilize mixture gamma (MG) distribution to accurately approximate them. Further, the total cochannel interference in the considered multicellular system is approximated using the moment-generating function (MGF) matching method. Accordingly, we present closed-form expressions for the distributions of relay-link SINR, link rates, and end-to-end rate. In addition, RSP is shown to effectively decrease the amount of fading (AoF) and, thus, mitigate the detrimental effects of composite fading/shadowing. Thorough results reveal significant performance improvements, which justify the use of RSP in cellular relay networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","volume":"62","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13487041","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378481/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Relay Site Planning Over Composite Fading/Shadowing Channels With Cochannel Interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Relay Site Planning Over Composite Fading/Shadowing Channels With Cochannel Interference","sourcePdf":"tvt-bulakci-2233506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121754S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6378481","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6378482,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ghasemi Damavandi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Ghasemi Damavandi","id":"37085464182"},{"name":"Aliazam Abbasfar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aliazam","lastName":"Abbasfar","id":"37276622400"},{"name":"David G.

One of the promising schemes proposed for alleviating the high PMEPR of OFDM signals is tone injection (TI). In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity algorithm for PMEPR reduction using TI. This algorithm first formulates the TI scheme as a combinatorial optimization problem and then finds a near-optimal solution to this problem via parametric minimum cross-entropy (PMCE) method. We also demonstrate that by effectively exploiting TI schemes in conjunction with cross constellations, it is possible to reduce the peak power of the system by more than 2 dB compared with sign selection schemes over conventional quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms similar existing algorithms, including the cross-entropy (CE) TI algorithm, the greedy sign selection algorithm, and the derandomization sign selection algorithm, in terms of PMEPR. We also present a threshold-based PMCE algorithm for TI that results in significant complexity reduction. Numerical results show that to achieve a prescribed PMEPR threshold, this threshold-based PMCE algorithm requires less computational complexity than the CE TI algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Systems Through Tone Injection via Parametric Minimum Cross-Entropy Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2233507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6514944/06378482.pdf","startPage":"1838","endPage":"1843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2233507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6514944","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Systems Through Tone Injection via Parametric Minimum Cross-Entropy Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6378482/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13487042","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Systems Through Tone Injection via Parametric Minimum Cross-Entropy Method","sourcePdf":"tvt-ghasemidamavandi-2233507-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07425S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6514944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6514944","articleId":"6378482","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6378490,"authors":[{"name":"Hina Tabassum","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378490/6378490-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hina Tabassum received her Bachelors degree in Electronics from the N.E.D University of Engineering and Technology (NEDUET), Karachi, Pakistan, in 2004.

The environment can be categorized into four cases, covering viaducts with different heights and in different suburban environments. Small values of fade depth, level crossing rates, and average fade duration are observed. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)-based evaluation indicates that the Ricean distribution is the best to describe small-scale amplitude fading. An analysis of the envelope autocovariance function shows that the coherence distance is less than 10 cm. The Ricean K-factor is modeled as a piecewise-linear function of distance. Moreover, a breakpoint path loss model is developed and shadow fading is investigated using the same break point as for the distance-dependent K-factor model. The Suzuki distribution is found to offer a good fit for the composite multipath/shadowing channels. We find that the viaduct height H, together with the number of surrounding scatterers, significantly affects the small- and large-scale channel parameters. These results are applicable to both normal-speed and high-speed railways, and will be useful in the modeling of railway viaduct channels and the design of railway wireless communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6472806/06378492.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472806","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"794","endPage":"805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Measurements and Analysis of Propagation Channels in High-Speed Railway Viaducts","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6378492/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13368572","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements and Analysis of Propagation Channels in High-Speed Railway Viaducts","sourcePdf":"794-tw1302-he.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079949S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6472806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6472806","articleId":"6378492","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378493,"authors":[{"name":"Sezi Bakim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I\u015f\u0131k University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378493/6378493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sezi Bakim received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2001; the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of New Mexico, USA in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2011.

We provide the optimality conditions that need to be satisfied by the powers associated with the users' codewords and derive the closed form expressions for the optimal powers. We propose two algorithms that can be used to optimize the powers to achieve any desired rate pair on the rate region boundary: a projected subgradient algorithm, and an iterative waterfilling-like algorithm based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality, which operates one user at a time and converges much faster. We observe that, utilization of power control to take advantage of the diversity offered by the cooperative OFDMA system, not only leads to a remarkable improvement in achievable rates, but also may help determine how the subchannels have to be instantaneously allocated to various tasks in cooperation. Simulations show that the gain from power allocation is still significant even when the CSI feedback is limited.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378493.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control for Two User Cooperative OFDMA Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378493/","displayDocTitle":"Power Control for Two User Cooperative OFDMA Channels","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250963","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378493/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control for Two User Cooperative OFDMA Channels","sourcePdf":"258-tw1301-bakim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068439S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378493","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6378494,"authors":[{"name":"Long Bao Le","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique \u00c9nergie, Mat \u00e9riaux et T \u00e9l \u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), University \u00e9du Qu\u00e9bec, Montreal City, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378494/6378494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Long Bao Le (S'04-M'07-SM'12) received the B.Eng.

We assume that Macrocell User Equipments (MUEs) can establish connections with Femtocell Base Stations (FBSs) to mitigate the excessive cross-tier interference and achieve better throughput. A cross-layer design model is considered where multiband opportunistic scheduling at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and admission control at the network layer working at different time-scales are assumed. We assume that both MUEs and Femtocell User Equipments (FUEs) have minimum average rate constraints, which depend on their geographical locations and their application requirements. In addition, blocking probability constraints are imposed on each FUE so that the connections from MUEs only result in controllable performance degradation for FUEs. We present an optimal design for the admission control problem by using the theory of Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). Moreover, we devise a novel distributed femtocell power adaptation algorithm, which converges to the Nash equilibrium of a corresponding power adaptation game. This power adaptation algorithm reduces energy consumption for femtocells while still maintaining individual cell throughput by adapting the FBS power to the traffic load in the network. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the desirable operation of the optimal admission control solution, the significant performance gain of the proposed hybrid access strategy with respect to the closed access counterpart, and the great power saving gain achieved by the proposed power adaptation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378494.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"180","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware and Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDMA Femtocells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware and Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDMA Femtocells","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250964","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6378494/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware and Energy-Efficient Resource Management in OFDMA Femtocells","sourcePdf":"180-tw1301-le.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122296S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378494","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378495,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378495/6378495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiang He (S'08, M'10) received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2003 and 2006 respectively.

As such, the model embodies both the interference and broadcast aspects of wireless networks. The leftmost node wishes to send messages to the rightmost node, while keeping these messages confidential from all the intermediate relay nodes. In this setting where any or all of the relay nodes can be eavesdroppers, it is shown that end-to-end secure and reliable communication is possible. Notably, it is shown that an end-to-end secrecy rate that is independent of the number of hops, i.e., intermediate eavesdroppers, is achievable by means of a carefully designed transmission schedule, compute-and-forward relaying and coding strategy utilizing nested lattice codes. The achievable rate obtained indicates that imposing secrecy constraints penalizes the capacity by at most 1 bit per channel use. Therefore, it is concluded that information theoretic secrecy can be guaranteed for this model irrespective of eavesdropping relays and a fixed modest cost for the end-to-end rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Secure Multi-Hop Communication with Untrusted Relays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.101358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378495.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.101358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Secure Multi-Hop Communication with Untrusted Relays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6378495/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250965","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Secure Multi-Hop Communication with Untrusted Relays","sourcePdf":"001-tw1301-he.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080062S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378495","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378496,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Moretti","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378496/6378496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Moretti graduated in electronic engineering at the University of Florence (Italy) in 1995 and received the Ph.D. degree in 2000 from the Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands).

Optimal resource allocation in MIMO systems requires the joint optimization of: a) linear transmit and receive spatial filters, b) channel assignment and c) power allocation. This problem is not convex and its complexity becomes thus intractable already for small sets of users and subcarriers. To reduce the complexity of the problem at hand, we propose a novel heuristic strategy that partitions the users in different groups according to their average channel quality and addresses the original problem by solving a succession of lower-complexity allocation problems. The spatial dimension is employed to prevent multiple access interference from hindering the performance of the sequential allocation. To further reduce the complexity burden we introduce a linear programming formulation in combination with a waterfilling-based strategy to allocate channels and power to the groups of users. Numerical results and evaluation of the computational complexity show that, though suboptimal, in most cases the proposed algorithm manages to exploit in an original way the inherent multi-user diversity of multi-carrier systems to ease the task of resource allocation with a very limited performance loss from the theoretic optimum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Margin Adaptive Scheduling for MIMO-OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120355","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378496.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Margin Adaptive Scheduling for MIMO-OFDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6378496/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250966","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Margin Adaptive Scheduling for MIMO-OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"278-tw1301-moretti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073304S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378496","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378497,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Sugiura","affiliation":["Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Nagakute, Aichi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378497/6378497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shinya Sugiura (M'06-SM'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from the Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mobile communications from the University of Southampton, Southampton, UK, in 2010.

Such an approach can significantly help in facilitating secure communication between legitimate parties but, by definition, assumes dedicated and/or altruistic nodes willing to act as cooperative jammers. In this paper, it is demonstrated that cooperative jamming leads to meaningful secrecy rate improvements even when this assumption is removed. A distributed mechanism is developed that motivates jamming participation of otherwise non-cooperative terminals, by compensating them with an opportunity to use the fraction of legitimate parties' spectrum for their own data traffic. With the goal of maximizing their data transmission rate priced by the invested power, cooperative jammers provide the jamming/transmitting power that is generally proportional to the amount of leased bandwidth. The fully decentralized framework is facilitated through a game-theoretic model, with the legitimate parties as the spectrum owners acting as the game leader, and the set of assisting jammers constituting the follower. To facilitate the behavior of non-cooperative and competitive multiple jammers, auctioning and power control mechanisms are applied for a follower sub-game in a two-layer leader-follower game framework.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.112001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","startPage":"134","endPage":"145","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378498.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Secrecy Rate via Spectrum Leasing for Friendly Jamming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378498/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Secrecy Rate via Spectrum Leasing for Friendly Jamming","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250968","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Secrecy Rate via Spectrum Leasing for Friendly Jamming","sourcePdf":"134-tw1301-stanojev.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075378S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378498","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6378499,"authors":[{"name":"Lusheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378499/6378499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lusheng Wang is currently a professor in the School of Computer and Information at Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), Anhui, China.

In many cases, several BANs coexist in a small area, resulting in very strong inter-BAN interference, which seriously disturbs intra-BAN communications. The goal of this paper is to decrease inter-BAN interference by cooperative scheduling, hence increasing packet reception rate (PRR) of intra-BAN communications. Cooperative scheduling here is divided into two sub-problems: single-BAN scheduling as an assignment problem and multi-BAN concurrent scheduling as a game. For the first sub-problem, a low complexity algorithm, horse racing scheduling, is proposed, which achieves near-optimal PRR for the BAN performing scheduling. For the second sub-problem, we prove the existence of a set of mixed strategy Nash equilibria (MSNE). Then, we propose a distributed cooperative scheduling scheme, which efficiently achieves higher PRR than the MSNE without degrading fairness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06378499.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.112073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.112073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling for Coexisting Body Area Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Scheduling","Interference","Games","Indexes","Body area networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","cooperative communication","game theory","radiofrequency interference","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","embedded wireless systems","interBAN interference","packet reception rate","PRR","intraBAN communications","single-BAN scheduling","multiBAN concurrent scheduling","horse racing scheduling","near-optimal PRR","mixed strategy Nash equilibria","MSNE","distributed cooperative scheduling scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body area network (BAN)","cooperative scheduling","combinatorial optimization","Tian Ji horse racing","game theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Scheduling for Coexisting Body Area Networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6378499/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250969","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Scheduling for Coexisting Body Area Networks","sourcePdf":"123-tw1301-wqng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084583S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378499","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378500,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolo Mazzali","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, University of Parma, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6378500/6378500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolo Mazzali (S'12) was born in Carpi, Italy, in 1983.

Spectral spreading, flatness and smoothness can be easily achieved by an appropriate choice of the maximum value of the modulation index and of the length of the index sequence. We will show that the proposed CPM-based spread spectrum system achieves an overall spectral efficiency larger than that of a single-user single-h CPM transmission even when a single-user detector is employed at the receiver. It also outperforms other solutions in the literature. In addition, we will also derive some suboptimal multi-user detectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378500/","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6378500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2012","displayDocTitle":"CPM-Based Spread Spectrum Systems for Multi-User Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CPM-Based Spread Spectrum Systems for Multi-User Communications","sourcePdf":"358-tw1301-mazzali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088402S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6378500","onlineDate":"11 December 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378529,"authors":[{"name":"Marian P.

The algorithm requires a pre-processing step in which the Voronoi diagram of the van der Waals spheres is used to calculate the cavity structure for each coordinate set of the trajectory. In the next step, we interactively compute dynamic channels by analyzing the time evolution of components of the cavity structure. Tracing of the cavity dynamics is supported by timeline visualization tools that allow the user to select specific components of the cavity structures for detailed exploration. All visualization methods are interactive and enable the user to animate the time-dependent molecular structure together with its cavity structure. To facilitate a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of a channel, we have also developed a visualization technique that renders a dynamic channel in a single image and color-codes time on its extension surface. We illustrate the usefullness of our tools by inspecting the structure and dynamics of internal cavities in the bacteriorhodopsin proton pump.","doi":"10.1109/BioVis.2012.6378599","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6373776/6378576/06378599.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioVis.2012.6378599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic channels in biomolecular systems: Path analysis and visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic channels in biomolecular systems: Path analysis and visualization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378599/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175501","conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic channels in biomolecular systems: Path analysis and visualization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"099106lindow.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097953S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6373776","isNumber":"6378576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6373776","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6378576","articleId":"6378599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6378606,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Salapura","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Within companies, private clouds are offering a more efficient way to manage and use private data centers. In the broader marketplace, public clouds offer the promise of buying computing capabilities based on a utility model. This utility model enables IT consumers to purchase compute resources on demand to fit current business needs and scale expenses associated with computing resources. Thus, cloud computing offers IT to be treated as an ongoing variable operating expense billed by usage rather than requiring capital expenditures that must be planned years in advance. Advantageously, operating expenses can be charged against the revenue generated by these expenses directly. In contrast, capital expenses incurred by the purchase of a system need to be paid at the time of purchase, but can only be depreciated to reduce the taxable income over the lifetime of the system.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design

(MLD) technology coupled with the popularization of memory-intensive applications provide fertile ground for architectures based on Intelligent Memory (IRAM) or Processors-in-Memory (PIM). The contribution of this paper is to explore one way to use the current state-of-the-art MLD technology for general-purpose computers. To satisfy requirements of general purpose and low programming cost, we place the PIM chips in the memory system and let them default to plain DRAM if the application is not enabled for intelligent memory. Since wide usability is crucial, we identify and analyze a range of real applications for PIM. Based on the requirements of these applications and current technological constraints, we design a PIM chip and a PIM-based memory system. We call the chip FlexRAM. We describe FlexRAMs design and floorplan, and the resulting memory system. Evaluation of the system through simulations shows that 4 FlexRAM chips often allow a workstation to run 25-40 times faster.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378608/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13187676","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378608/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"FlexRAM: Toward an advanced Intelligent Memory system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlexRAM: Toward an advanced Intelligent Memory system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"005kang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.308265S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6378619,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hsiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37933240600"},{"name":"De-Yu Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"De-Yu","lastName":"Shen","id":"38529120200"},{"name":"Yi-Jung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Jung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37859457600"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279097400"},{"name":"Michael Wang","affiliation":["Macronix International Company Limited, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wang","id":"38529304500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378619","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":656},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378619","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Decoding","Error analysis","Error correction codes","DRAM chips","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","energy conservation","error correction","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SECRET","selective error correction for refresh energy reduction","main memory","system power consumption","low-power DRAM design","memory cells","process variation","retention time variation","single worst-case refresh period","refresh interval","retention errors","hard errors","error correction information","leaky cells","off-line phase","memory cell identification","target error rate","low-overhead error correction mechanism","refresh power reduction","DRAM power reduction","dynamic random-access memory"]}],"abstract":"DRAMs are used as the main memory in most computing systems today. Studies show that DRAMs contribute to a significant part of overall system power consumption. Therefore, one of the main challenges in low-power DRAM design is the inevitable refresh process. Due to process variation, memory cells exhibit retention time variations. Current DRAMs use a single worst-case refresh period. Prolonging refresh intervals introduces retention errors. Previous works adopt conventional ECC (Error Correcting Code) to correct retention errors. These approaches introduce significant area and energy overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel error correction framework for retention errors in DRAMs, called SECRET (Selective Error Correction for Refresh Energy reducTion). The key observation we make is that retention errors can be treated as hard errors rather than soft errors, and only few DRAM cells have large leakage. Therefore, instead of equipping error correction capability in all memory cells as existing ECC schemes, we only allocate error correction information to leaky cells under a refresh interval. Our SECRET framework contains two parts, an off-line phase to identify memory cells with retention errors given a target error rate, and a low-overhead error correction mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed SECRET framework can reduce refresh power by 87.2%, and overall DRAM power by 18.57% with negligible area and performance overheads.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378619","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SECRET: Selective error correction for refresh energy reduction in DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378619/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"SECRET: Selective error correction for refresh energy reduction in DRAMs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13176090","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378619/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SECRET: Selective error correction for refresh energy reduction in DRAMs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"067lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049842S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6378622,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Liu","id":"37400572600"},{"name":"Jan Reineke","affiliation":["University of Saarland, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Reineke","id":"37540941000"},{"name":"David Broman","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden","University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Broman","id":"37392280600"},{"name":"Michael Zimmer","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zimmer","id":"38232110800"},{"name":"Edward A.

However, the robustness of NAND flash cells is an increasing concern, especially at nanometer-regime process geometries. NAND flash memory bit error rate increases exponentially with the number of program/erase cycles. Stronger error correcting codes (ECC) can be used to tolerate higher error rates, but these have diminishing returns with increasing P/E cycles and can have prohibitively high power, area, and latency overheads. The goal of this paper is to develop new techniques that can tolerate high bit error rates without requiring prohibitively strong ECC. Our techniques, called Flash Correct-and-Refresh (FCR) exploit the observation that the dominant error source in NAND flash memory is retention errors, caused by flash cells losing charge over time. The key idea is to periodically read, correct, and reprogram (in-place) or remap the stored data before it accumulates more retention errors than can be corrected by simple ECC. Detailed simulations of a solid-state drive (SSD) storage system driven by measured experimental data from error characterization on real flash memory chips show that our techniques provide 46\u00d7 average lifetime improvement on a variety of workloads at no additional hardware cost. We also find that our techniques achieve lifetime improvements that cannot feasibly be achieved with stronger ECC.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378623","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378623.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flash correct-and-refresh: Retention-aware error management for increased flash memory lifetime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Flash correct-and-refresh: Retention-aware error management for increased flash memory lifetime","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378623/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13176094","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash correct-and-refresh: Retention-aware error management for increased flash memory lifetime","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"094cai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116645S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6378626,"authors":[{"name":"Zihan Xu","affiliation":["School of ECEE, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Zihan","lastName":"Xu","id":"38529129000"},{"name":"Ketul B.

This is often referred to as emulation, and we use the terms simulation and emulation interchangeably in this paper. However, limited hardware on FPGAs prevents large designs from being implemented on a single FPGA. Hence there is a need to partition the design and simulate it on a multi-FPGA platform. In contrast to existing FPGA-based post-synthesis partitioning approaches which first completely flatten the circuit and then possibly perform bottom-up clustering, we perform a selective top-down flattening and thereby avoid the potential netlist blowup. This also allows us to preserve the design hierarchy to guide the partitioning and to make subsequent debugging easier. Our approach analyzes the hierarchical design and selectively flattens instances using two metrics based on slack. The resulting partially flattened netlist is converted to a hypergraph, partitioned using hMetis, and reconverted back to a plurality of FPGA netlists, one for each FPGA of the FPGA-based accelerated logic simulation platform. We compare our approach with a partitioning approach that operates on a completely flattened netlist. Static timing analysis was performed for both approaches, and over 15 large examples from the OpenCores project, our approach yields a 52% logic simulation speedup and about 0.74\u00d7 runtime for the entire flow, compared to the completely flat approach. The entire tool chain of our approach is automated in an end-to-end flow from hierarchy extraction, selective flattening, partitioning, and netlist reconstruction. Compared to an existing method which also performs slack-based partitioning of a hierarchical netlist, we obtain a 35% simulation speedup. Our method scales very well, yielding a significantly better simulation speedup and runtime improvement for larger examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing aware partitioning for multi-FPGA based logic simulation using top-down selective hierarchy flattening","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378634","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378634.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Timing aware partitioning for multi-FPGA based logic simulation using top-down selective hierarchy flattening","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378634/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176105","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing aware partitioning for multi-FPGA based logic simulation using top-down selective hierarchy flattening","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"153swaminathan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096607S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378637,"authors":[{"name":"Dragomir Milojevic","affiliation":["IMEC, Belgium","IMEC"],"firstName":"Dragomir","lastName":"Milojevic","id":"38559284500"},{"name":"Sachin Idgunji","affiliation":["ARM"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Idgunji","id":"37393926400"},{"name":"Djordje Jevdjic","affiliation":["EPFL"],"firstName":"Djordje","lastName":"Jevdjic","id":"38264213900"},{"name":"Emre Ozer","affiliation":["ARM"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Ozer","id":"37265472100"},{"name":"Pejman Lotfi-Kamran","affiliation":["EPFL"],"firstName":"Pejman","lastName":"Lotfi-Kamran","id":"38265125000"},{"name":"Andreas Panteli","affiliation":["University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Panteli","id":"38580996000"},{"name":"Andreas Prodromou","affiliation":["University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Prodromou","id":"38580469100"},{"name":"Chrysostomos Nicopoulos","affiliation":["University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Chrysostomos","lastName":"Nicopoulos","id":"37300402600"},{"name":"Damien Hardy","affiliation":["University of Cyprus"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Hardy","id":"37664088500"},{"name":"Babak Falsari","affiliation":["TEPFL"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Falsari","id":"37088694725"},{"name":"Yiannakis Sazeides","affiliation":["University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Yiannakis","lastName":"Sazeides","id":"37332284800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378637","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Through-silicon vias","System-on-a-chip","Bandwidth","Clouds","Density measurement","Power system measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","DRAM chips","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip","thermal analysis","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal characterization","power-efficient many-core server-on-chip system","3D-stacked wide I/O DRAM","datacenters","logic die","memory bandwidth","through-silicon vias","TSV","full-system microarchitectural modeling","rapid virtual physical prototyping","thermal analysis","CPU-centric benchmarks","SPECInt","Dhrystone","logic+DRAM","memory-intensive cloud workloads","temperature 175 C to 200 C"]}],"abstract":"We propose a power-efficient many-core server-on-chip system with 3D-stacked Wide I/O DRAM targeting cloud workloads in datacenters. The integration of 3D-stacked Wide I/O DRAM on top of a logic die increases available memory bandwidth by using dense and fast Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) instead of off-chip IOs, enabling faster data transfers at much lower energy per bit. We demonstrate a methodology that includes full-system microarchitectural modeling and rapid virtual physical prototyping with emphasis on the thermal analysis. Our findings show that while executing CPU-centric benchmarks (e.g. SPECInt and Dhrystone), the temperature in the server-on-chip (logic+DRAM) is in the range of 175-200\u00b0C at a power consumption of less than 20W, exceeding the reliable operating bounds without any cooling solutions, even with embedded cores. However, with real cloud workloads, the power density in the server-on-chip remains much below the temperatures reached by the CPU-centric workloads as a result of much lower power burnt by memory-intensive cloud workloads. We show that such a server-on-chip system is feasible with a low-cost passive heat sink eliminating the need for a high-cost active heat sink with an attached fan, creating an opportunity for overall cost and energy savings in datacenters.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378637","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378637.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal characterization of cloud workloads on a power-efficient server-on-chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"Thermal characterization of cloud workloads on a power-efficient server-on-chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378637/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13176108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378637/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal characterization of cloud workloads on a power-efficient server-on-chip","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"175milojevic.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059468S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6378639,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Ling Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ling","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37852489300"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Ho","id":"37398757000"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378639","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378639","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Heuristic algorithms","Mixers","Sensors","System-on-a-chip","Proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biological techniques","chemical sensors","drops","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","microsensors","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design methodology","digital microfluidic biochips","front-end operations","biochemical assays","biochemical applications","design automation","sample preparation","architectural synthesis","layout synthesis","dynamic error recovery"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378639","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378639.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design methodology for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","abstract":"Recent advances in digital microfluidic biochips have led to a promising future for miniaturized laboratories, with the associated advantages of high sensitivity and reconfigurability. As one of the front-end operations on digital microfluidic biochips, sample preparation plays an important role in biochemical assays and applications. For fast and high-throughput biochemical applications, it is critical to develop an automated design methodology for sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not provide solutions to the problem of design automation for sample preparation. Moreover, it is critical to ensure the correctness of droplets and recover from errors efficiently during sample preparation. Published work on error recovery is inefficient and impractical for sample preparation. Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated design methodology for sample preparation, including architectural synthesis, layout synthesis, and dynamic error recovery. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on real-life biochemical applications to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 48.39% reduction in sample preparation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378639/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13176110","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design methodology for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design methodology for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"189hsieh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081177S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378647,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon Seok Yang","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yoon Seok","lastName":"Yang","id":"37858908500"},{"name":"Reeshav Kumar","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Reeshav","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37851611200"},{"name":"Gwan Choi","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gwan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37272560200"},{"name":"Paul Gratz","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Systems Group, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gratz","id":"37540639900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378647","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"abstract":"WaveSync is a low-latency focused, network-on-chip architecture for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) designs. WaveSync facilitates low-latency communication leveraging the source-synchronous clock sent with the data, to time components in the downstream routers data-path to reduce the number of synchronizations needed. WaveSync accomplishes this by partitioning the router components at each node into different clock-domains, each synchronized with one of the the orthogonal incoming source synchronous clocks in a GALS 2D mesh network. The data and clock subsequently propagate through each node/router, synchronously, until the destination is reached, regardless of the number of hops it may take. As long as the data travel in the path of clock propagation, and no congestion is encountered, it will be propagated without latching, as if in a long-combinatorial path, with both the clock and the data accruing delay at the same rate. The result is that the need for synchronization between the mesochronous nodes and/or the asynchronous control associated with typical GALS network is completely eliminated. The proposed WaveSync network outperforms conventional GALS networks by 87-90% in average nanosecond latency with 1.8-6.5 times more throughput across synthetic traffic patterns and SPLASH-2 benchmark suite.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378647.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"248","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WaveSync: A low-latency source synchronous bypass network-on-chip architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Routing","Clocks","Silicon compounds","Microarchitecture","Control systems","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","network routing","network-on-chip","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-latency source synchronous bypass network-on-chip architecture","globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous designs","GALS designs","low-latency communication","source-synchronous clock","time components","downstream router data-path","synchronization reduction","clock-domains","GALS 2D mesh network","clock propagation","long-combinatorial path","mesochronous nodes","asynchronous control","GALS network","WaveSync network","SPLASH-2 benchmark suite","synthetic traffic patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"WaveSync: A low-latency source synchronous bypass network-on-chip architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378647/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176118","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WaveSync: A low-latency source synchronous bypass network-on-chip architecture","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"241yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066927S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6378649,"authors":[{"name":"Firas Hawi","affiliation":["Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Firas","lastName":"Hawi","id":"38529277000"},{"name":"Mohamad Sawan","affiliation":["Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Sawan","id":"37276702600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378649","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Correlation","Real-time systems","Image color analysis","Visualization","Field programmable gate arrays","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","handicapped aids","neurophysiology","stereo image processing","vision defects","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-based passive stereovision system","cortical visual stimulator","phase-based passive stereovision architecture","phase-based correspondence search algorithm","sparse stereovision application","1D phase correlation method","2D phase correlation method","degradation cost","disparity estimation accuracy","3D imaging device","blind","cortical visual stimulation","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Signal Processing","Stereo","Real-Time Systems","3D imaging"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we design, evaluate and compare two phase-based passive stereovision architectures.

This technology presents a fast access time but high energy consumption and low density. As opposite, the recently appeared embedded Dynamic RAM (eDRAM) technology allows caches to be built with lower energy and area, although with a slower access time. The eDRAM technology provides important leakage and area savings, especially in huge Last-Level Caches (LLCs), which occupy almost half the silicon area in some recent microprocessors. This paper proposes a novel hybrid LLC, which combines SRAM and eDRAM banks to address the trade-off among performance, energy, and area. To this end, we explore the optimal percentage of SRAM and eDRAM banks that achieves the best target trade-off. Architectural mechanisms have been devised to keep the most likely accessed blocks in fast SRAM banks as well as to avoid unnecessary destructive reads. Experimental results show that, compared to a conventional SRAM LLC with the same storage capacity, performance degradation does not surpass, on average, 2.9% (even with 12.5% of banks built with SRAM technology), whereas area savings can be as high as 46% for a 1MB-16way LLC. For a 45nm technology node, the energy-delay squared product confirms that a hybrid cache is a better design than the conventional SRAM cache regardless the number of eDRAM banks, and also better than a conventional eDRAM cache when the number of SRAM banks is a quarter or an eighth of the cache banks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176126","htmlLink":"/document/6378655/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the optimal ratio of SRAM banks in hybrid caches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the optimal ratio of SRAM banks in hybrid caches","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"297valero.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075734S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6378656,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37402668100"},{"name":"Weikang Qian","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Shanghai Jiaotong University Joint Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weikang","lastName":"Qian","id":"37591271800"},{"name":"David J.

However, for certain complex arithmetic operations, computation on stochastic bit streams can consume less energy and tolerate more soft errors. In addition, the latency issue could be solved by using a faster clock frequency or in combination with a parallel processing approach. To take advantage of this computing technique, previous work proposed a combinational logic-based reconfigurable architecture to perform complex arithmetic operations on stochastic streams of bits. In this paper, we enhance and extend this reconfigurable architecture using sequential logic. Compared to the previous approach, the proposed reconfigurable architecture takes less hardware area and consumes less energy, while achieving the same performance in terms of processing time and fault-tolerance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378656.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic reconfigurable architecture for fault-tolerant computation with sequential logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Polynomials","Multiplexing","Image coding","Streaming media","Silicon","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","digital arithmetic","energy consumption","fault tolerant computing","parallel architectures","performance evaluation","power aware computing","reconfigurable architectures","sequential circuits","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic reconfigurable architecture","fault tolerant computation","sequential logic","stochastic bit streams","complex arithmetic operations","soft error tolerance","energy consumption reduction","latency issue","clock frequency","parallel processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic reconfigurable architecture for fault-tolerant computation with sequential logic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378656/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176127","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic reconfigurable architecture for fault-tolerant computation with sequential logic","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"303li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060996S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6378657,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Jaksic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Jaksic","id":"38222042700"},{"name":"Ramon Canal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Canal","id":"37391750000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378657","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing 3T DRAMs for SRAM replacement under 10nm tri-gate SOI FinFETs","abstract":"In this paper, we present the dynamic 3T memory cell for future 10nm tri-gate FinFETs as a potential replacement for classical 6T SRAM cell for implementation in high speed cache memories.

A case study consisting of a CORDIC DSP unit employing the proposed model provides tradeoffs between power, performance and reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378659/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176130","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast error aware model for arithmetic and logic circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast error aware model for arithmetic and logic circuits","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"322zaynoun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050893S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6378660,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Vezyrtzis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Vezyrtzis","id":"37569834400"},{"name":"Yannis Tsividis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Tsividis","id":"37270896700"},{"name":"Steven M.

Traditionally, these lines are designed as real-time pipelines with static granularity, fine enough to handle a worst-case input rate. However, due to their rigid structure, they have sub-optimal energy for low- and varying-rate input streams. We introduce a complete methodology for designing reconfigurable delay lines which dynamically adapt granularity to traffic, on-the-fly, without stalling or disturbing normal operation. These lines have two modes: coarse- and fine-grain. During sparser traffic, the system is reconfigured to coarse-grain mode, thereby reducing total energy, and it reverts to fine-grain mode during denser traffic. In each case, overall delay is preserved. This strategy is especially beneficial for applications where input traffic is highly varied. The particular focus of this paper is on one promising domain, continuous-time digital signal processors (CT DSP's), a new class of processors targeting low-energy applications. The proposed system includes two lightweight asynchronous control blocks: a digital controller to continuously monitor input traffic, and a micropipeline to dynamically reconfigure the entire delay line. With a complete implementation in a 0.13 um IBM CMOS technology, post-layout simulations demonstrate an average overall dynamic power reduction up to 45.5% compared to a non-adaptive design, with only minimal area overhead. The design methodology is modular, supporting extensions to multiple configuration modes to provide even greater power reduction for a variety of input traffic. While results are presented for CT DSP's, significant benefits are also expected in many other domains where delay lines are used.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","Delay","Digital signal processing","Monitoring","Protocols","Real-time systems","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","continuous time systems","delay lines","digital control","digital signal processing chips","energy conservation","pipeline processing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined delay line design","dynamically-adaptive granularity","low-energy application","calibrated delay line","digital system","real-time pipeline","static granularity","worst-case input rate","rigid structure","suboptimal energy","low-rate input stream","varying-rate input stream","reconfigurable delay line design","granularity dynamic adaptation","coarse-grain mode","total energy reduction","variable input traffic","continuous-time digital signal processor","CT DSP","lightweight asynchronous control block","digital controller","input traffic continuous monitoring","micropipeline","IBM CMOS technology","post-layout simulation","dynamic power reduction","nonadaptive design"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378660","startPage":"329","endPage":"336","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378660.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing pipelined delay lines with dynamically-adaptive granularity for low-energy applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Designing pipelined delay lines with dynamically-adaptive granularity for low-energy applications","accessionNumber":"13176131","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xploreNote":"The original article file provided to Xplore had problems with various figures not displaying correctly.

Unfortunately, PCM's access latency and energy are higher than DRAM's and its endurance is lower. Many DRAM-PCM hybrid memory systems use DRAM as a cache to PCM, to achieve the low access latency and energy, and high endurance of DRAM, while taking advantage of PCM's large capacity. A key question is what data to cache in DRAM to best exploit the advantages of each technology while avoiding its disadvantages as much as possible. We propose a new caching policy that improves hybrid memory performance and energy efficiency. Our observation is that both DRAM and PCM banks employ row buffers that act as a cache for the most recently accessed memory row. Accesses that are row buffer hits incur similar latencies (and energy consumption) in DRAM and PCM, whereas accesses that are row buffer misses incur longer latencies (and higher energy consumption) in PCM. To exploit this, we devise a policy that avoids accessing in PCM data that frequently causes row buffer misses because such accesses are costly in terms of both latency and energy. Our policy tracks the row buffer miss counts of recently used rows in PCM, and caches in DRAM the rows that are predicted to incur frequent row buffer misses. Our proposed caching policy also takes into account the high write latencies of PCM, in addition to row buffer locality. Compared to a conventional DRAM-PCM hybrid memory system, our row buffer locality-aware caching policy improves system performance by 14% and energy efficiency by 10% on data-intensive server and cloud-type workloads. The proposed policy achieves 31% performance gain over an all-PCM memory system, and comes within 29% of the performance of an allDRAM memory system (not taking PCM's capacity benefit into account) on evaluated workloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378661/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13176132","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Row buffer locality aware caching policies for hybrid memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Row buffer locality aware caching policies for hybrid memories","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"337yoon.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065812S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6378664,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38529269900"},{"name":"Weijun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Weijun","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38525872400"},{"name":"Nohhyun Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Nohhyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37599367400"},{"name":"David J.

It is expected that photonic NoCs will play an important role in alleviating current power, latency, and bandwidth constraints. However, photonic NoCs are sensitive to ambient temperature variations because their basic constituents, ring resonators, are themselves sensitive to those variations. Since ring resonators are basic building blocks for photonic modulators, switches, multiplexers, and demultiplexers, variations of on-chip temperature pose serious challenges to the proper operation of photonic NoCs. Proposed methods that mitigate the effects of temperature at device level are either difficult to use in CMOS processes or not suitable for large scale implementation. In this paper, we propose Aurora, a thermally resilient photonic NoC architecture design that supports reliable and low bit error rate (BER) on-chip communications in the presence of large temperature variations. Our proposed architecture leverages solutions at both device and architecture layers that synergistically provide significant improvements. To compensate for small temperature variations, our design varies the bias current through ring resonators. For larger temperature variations, we propose architecture-level techniques to re-route messages away from hot regions, and through cooler regions, to their destinations, thereby lowering BER. Our simulation results show that Aurora provides a robust architectural solution to handle temperature variation effects on future photonic NoCs. For instance, average BER and message error rate (MER) are reduced by 78% and 30% respectively when the combined device and architectural technique (SPF) is applied. From the perspective of power efficiency, Aurora is also superior to conventional photonic NoC architectures by as much as 33%.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378667","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 30th International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362370/6378602/06378667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378602","startPage":"379","endPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aurora: A thermally resilient photonic network-on-chip architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aurora: A thermally resilient photonic network-on-chip architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378667/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176138","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378667/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aurora: A thermally resilient photonic network-on-chip architecture","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"379qouneh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10588S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378681,"authors":[{"name":"Shrikanth Ganapathy","affiliation":["Department dArquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Shrikanth","lastName":"Ganapathy","id":"37408917700"},{"name":"Ramon Canal","affiliation":["Department dArquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Canal","id":"37391750000"},{"name":"Dan Alexandrescu","affiliation":["Engineering Division, IRoC Technologies SA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Alexandrescu","id":"37543120000"},{"name":"Enrico Costenaro","affiliation":["Engineering Division, IRoC Technologies SA, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Costenaro","id":"37946129100"},{"name":"Antonio Gonzalez","affiliation":["Department dArquitectura de Computadors, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37274399700"},{"name":"Antonio Rubio","affiliation":["Department dEnginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rubio","id":"37331955500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3052-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-3050-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6404"},{"format":"CD","value":"1063-6404"}],"articleNumber":"6378681","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Transistors","Random access memory","Threshold voltage","Capacitance","System-on-a-chip","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","embedded systems","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variation-tolerant 4T-DRAM cell","enhanced soft error tolerance","device scaling issues","embedded DRAM","eDRAM technology","SRAM","on-chip memories","memory cells"]}],"abstract":"In view of device scaling issues, embedded DRAM (eDRAM) technology is being considered as a strong alternative to conventional SRAM for use in on-chip memories.

Unfortunately, system-level trends such as increased memory contention in multi-core architectures and data mapping schemes that improve memory parallelism lead to only a small amount of the buffered data to be accessed. This makes buffering large amounts of data on every memory array access energy-inefficient; yet organizing DRAM chips to buffer small amounts of data is costly, as others have shown [11]. Emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as PCM, STT-RAM, and RRAM, however, do not have destructive read operations, opening up opportunities for employing small row buffers without incurring additional area penalty and/or design complexity. In this work, we discuss and evaluate architectural changes to enable small row buffers at a low cost in NVMs. We find that on a multi-core system, reducing the row buffer size can greatly reduce main memory dynamic energy compared to a DRAM baseline with large row sizes, without greatly affecting endurance, and for some NVM technologies, leads to improved performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6378685/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13176156","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A case for small row buffers in non-volatile main memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case for small row buffers in non-volatile main memories","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"484meza.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050479S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362370","isNumber":"6378602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362370","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6378602","articleId":"6378685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6378692,"authors":[{"name":"George R.

Our ECC scheme works at word level while the conventional ECC scheme works at cache line or set level; Our scheme protects only dirty words.

The ac modulation method maximizes measurement sensitivity for small Kerr constant material like transformer oil. The measurements are conducted with ac peak-to-peak voltages set to various percentages of the dc voltages 1 kV-18 kV, with modulation frequencies in the range of 10 Hz-10 kHz, and at 3 different positions between the parallel plate electrodes with 2 mm spacing. When the dc voltage is low, there exist a wide range of modulation frequencies and amplitudes that ensure the accuracy of the measured results. When there is insignificant space charge effect a modulation frequency as low as 10 Hz and ac peak-to-peak voltage comparable to the dc voltage can still yield data of high accuracy. Some unreliable measurements occur at relatively low modulation frequencies and high ratios of ac to dc voltages when higher dc high voltage is applied, which establishes a space charge distribution in the gap which is disturbed by the ac modulation voltage. To increase the accuracy and reliability of the measurements the modulation frequency is increased and the applied ac voltage is made as small as possible. It is shown that an increasingly limited range of modulation frequencies and ac voltages is allowed for accurate measurements as the dc high voltage is increased. Although a photo diode and a lock-in amplifier are used in the measurements as light detector, this work identifies the requirements on key parameters, such as maximum frame rate and sensitivity, when upgrading to modern CCD cameras in the future work.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage measurement","Electric fields","Frequency modulation","Frequency measurement","Electrodes","Oil insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrodes","photodiodes","reliability","space charge","transformer oil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC modulation frequency effect","amplitude effect","transformer oil","Kerr electrooptic field mapping measurement technique","electric field distribution measurement","parallel plate copper electrodes","measurement sensitivity","small Kerr constant material","space charge effect","space charge distribution","reliability","photodiode","lock-in amplifier","light detector","maximum frame rate","CCD cameras","voltage 1 kV to 18 kV","frequency 10 Hz to 10 kHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378877","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel5/6363629/6378706/06378877.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of AC modulation frequency and amplitude on kerr electro-optic field mapping measurements in transformer oil","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6378877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of AC modulation frequency and amplitude on kerr electro-optic field mapping measurements in transformer oil","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378877/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378877/","accessionNumber":"13174993","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of AC modulation frequency and amplitude on kerr electro-optic field mapping measurements in transformer oil","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051942S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6363629","isNumber":"6378706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6363629","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6378706","articleId":"6378877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6378893,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A discussion to determine the best configuration is presented.","doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378893","startPage":"767","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2012.6378893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6378706","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel5/6363629/6378706/06378893.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of polluted insulators characteristics using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6378893/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of polluted insulators characteristics using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6378893/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13175009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of polluted insulators characteristics using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039467S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6363629","isNumber":"6378706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6363629","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6378706","articleId":"6378893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6379060,"authors":[{"name":"Oriol Font-Bach","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Oriol","lastName":"Font-Bach","id":"38529258900"},{"name":"Nikolaos Bartzoudis","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Bartzoudis","id":"37282885500"},{"name":"Antonio Pascual-Iserte","affiliation":["Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain","Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Pascual-Iserte","id":"38529172000"},{"name":"David L\u00f3pez Bueno","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"L\u00f3pez Bueno","id":"38529076800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379060","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Resource management","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time FPGA-based implementation","high-performance MIMO-OFDM transceiver","closed-loop communication scheme","multiantenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmitter","multiantenna OFDM receiver","CL communication scheme","PHY-layer development","mobile WiMAX standard","limited MAC functionality","transmit antenna selection decision","TAS decision","instantaneous CSI","instantaneous channel state information","RTL implementation","transmission scheme","FPGA resource optimal reuse","adaptive subcarrier allocation","open-loop counterpart"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present the FPGA implementation of a multi-antenna Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmitter and receiver featuring a closed-loop (CL) communication scheme. The PHY-layer development follows the specifications of the mobile WiMAX standard, whereas the limited MAC functionality is using custom specifications. In the implemented CL scheme, the transmitter applies a Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) decision based on the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI), which is calculated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter. The RTL implementation addresses the challenge of efficiently accommodating two transmission schemes with optimal reuse of FPGA resources. The adaptive subcarrier allocation can be thoroughly evaluated only when prototyped in a real-time platform, such as the one described in this paper.

One main drawback of the conventional PTS method is the need of side information. When the side information is lost, the received data cannot be decoded correctly by the receiver. In this paper, we propose a new side-information free PTS scheme, where a difference vector along with an input data block is generated by using an extended constellation. After dividing the difference vector into some disjoint subblocks, the inverse fast Fourier transform of the input data block and that of each subblock of the difference vector are combined optimally to form a low-PAPR OFDM signal for transmission.

This paper investigates the performance of a transmission over a relay channel where information is protected by two layers of coding. In the first layer, transmission reliability is ensured by fountain coding at the source. The second layer incorporates network coding at the relay node. Thus, fountain coded packets are re-encoded at the relay in order to increase packet diversity and reduce energy consumption. Performance of the transmission is measured by the total number of transmissions needed until the message is successfully decoded at the destination. We show through both analytical derivations and simulations that adding network coding capabilities at the relay optimizes system resource consumption. When the source uses a random linear fountain code, the proposed two-layer encoding becomes more powerful as it reduces the transmission rate over the direct link between the source and the destination.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of intra-flow network coding on the relay channel performance: An analytical study","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379081","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379081.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Impact of intra-flow network coding on the relay channel performance: An analytical study","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379081/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of intra-flow network coding on the relay channel performance: An analytical study","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p232apavatjrut.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080202S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379105,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El Shafie","affiliation":["Wireless Intelligent Networks Center (WINC), Nile University, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"El Shafie","id":"38259650100"},{"name":"Ahmed Sultan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sultan","id":"37410033100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379105","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Energy harvesting","Throughput","Receivers","Delay","Queueing analysis","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","delays","probability","quality of service","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random spectrum sensing","energy harvesting cognitive radio","optimal random access scheme","primary automatic repeat request feedback","ARQ feedback","access probability","secondary queueing","primary queueing delay","quality of service","QoS","spectrum sensing errors","multipacket reception","MPR","random access system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy harvesting","queueing delay"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal random access and random spectrum sensing for an energy harvesting cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","endPage":"410","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379105","startPage":"403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379105","abstract":"We consider a secondary user with energy harvesting capability.

We consider a CR Base Station (CR-BS) has multiple spectrum bands over a wide frequency range and uses channel-dependent data rates to communicate with the Secondary Users (SUs). To maximize the spectrum utilization while supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of the SUs, various decisions needs to be made during the operational period of the CR system taking into account not only the behavior of Primary Users (PUs) and SUs but also the current utilization of each spectrum band. In this paper, we propose an optimal policy for joint spectrum resource management in multi-band CR networks, which consists of admission control, spectrum band selection, spectrum handover and eviction control. The problem is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and the optimal decision for each system state is derived to reduce the SU blocking probability while keeping the SU dropping probability upper-bounded. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed policy outperforms other three policies in terms of both the SU blocking probability and the SU dropping probability.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379106","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379106.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379106","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","startPage":"411","endPage":"418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal policy for joint spectrum resource management in multi-band cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal policy for joint spectrum resource management in multi-band cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379106/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379106/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175365","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal policy for joint spectrum resource management in multi-band cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p411suga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124277S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6379109,"authors":[{"name":"Sylwia Romaszko","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sylwia","lastName":"Romaszko","id":"37695610900"},{"name":"Petri M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","id":"37266541100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379109","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Mirrors","Availability","Arrays","Zinc","Decision support systems","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","next generation networks","protocols","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous torus quorum-based rendezvous system","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","CR technology","next generation communication network","xG communication network","dynamic spectrum access networks","DSAN","dynamic network topology","location varying spectrum availability","CRAN","control traffic channel","RDV","single channel networks","pseudorandom solutions","power saving protocols","heterogeneous channel","heterogeneous rotation closure property","heterogeneous difference pair property","difference set based rendezvous protocol","torus QS","bounded maximum time-to-rendezvous","hopping sequence period"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology is the key technology that enables the Next Generation (xG) communication network, also called Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DSANs), to use spectrum in a dynamic manner. Due to the dynamic network topology and the time and location varying spectrum availability in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRANs), there is a need of on-demand searching for a control traffic channel by CR users in order to be able to initiate a communication. A rendezvous (RDV) is therefore a new challenge, not encountered in single channel networks. Hence, methods guaranteeing that all nodes meet periodically in reasonable periods of time should be advocated, i.e., instead of using pseudo-random solutions, systematic approaches should be considered, e.g, quorum systems (QSs) popular especially in power saving protocols. In this study, we focus on RDV guarantee on all available common channels with the heterogeneous channel availability, while satisfying the heterogeneous Rotation Closure Property through complying with the heterogeneous difference (map) pair properties. We enhance a torus QS and Difference Set based rendezvous protocol, designed in our previous work, such that we can guarantee a small and bounded maximum Time-to-Rendezvous, and RDV on all channels in a hopping sequence period.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379109","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379109.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379109","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","startPage":"427","endPage":"434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous torus quorum-based rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous torus quorum-based rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379109/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175368","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous torus quorum-based rendezvous in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p427romaszko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136221S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6379114,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Haddad","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, LTCI CNRS, Networks and Computer Science Department, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Haddad","id":"37994987000"},{"name":"Maurice Gagnaire","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM, LTCI CNRS, Networks and Computer Science Department, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Gagnaire","id":"38522030800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379114","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Optical modulation","Optical fibers","Optical fiber communication","Optical sensors","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","genetic algorithms","heuristic programming","Long Term Evolution","mobile antennas","Pareto optimisation","radio-over-fibre","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto-based genetic optimization","PaGeO","LTE radio-over-fiber cellular backhauling strategy","cost-effective radio-antenna backhauling","analog optical transmission","analog RoF links","RoF signal impairments","wireless system capacity","impairment-aware RoF-based cellular backhauling system","optical capacity","RoF physical impairments","evolutionary multiobjective heuristic programming","GeRoFAN control plane","backhauling policy","LTE radio cellular system","RF cellular planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379114","abstract":"Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) emerges as a promising solution to achieve cost-effective radio-antennas backhauling.

First, similarly to the conventional QRM-MLD, the proposed detection applies a fixed number of the survived branches to achieve a near-ML performance. Next, in order to evaluate the reliability of the survived branches in each detection layer, we introduce a ratio function of the path metric to the smallest path metric among the survived branches. The survived branch with lower reliability has less children nodes as the candidates in the next detection layer, which can avoid a large amount of the path metric evaluations and sorting. Hence, the complexity of the proposed detection should be low. Numerical results exhibit that the proposed scheme achieves the near-ML performance with lower complexity compared to the conventional QRM-MLD.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379120","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379120.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive candidate selection scheme in QRM-MLD algorithm for MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379120/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive candidate selection scheme in QRM-MLD algorithm for MIMO detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175379","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379120/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive candidate selection scheme in QRM-MLD algorithm for MIMO detection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p502hou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06508S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6379121,"authors":[{"name":"Danish Aziz","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Danish","lastName":"Aziz","id":"38505156500"},{"name":"Sevil Sentuerk","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Sevil","lastName":"Sentuerk","id":"38529359000"},{"name":"Andreas Weber","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Weber","id":"37561041600"},{"name":"Thorsten Wild","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Wild","id":"37586124800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379121","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379121","abstract":"It has been shown that Interference Alignment (IA) based transmit precoding achieves remarkable performance gains under ideal assumptions of perfect channel state information (CSI) and fully uncorrelated channels.

By using our model we have evaluated the performance of IA using two different receiver algorithms based on ideal and practical realizations. We have further compared the performance of IA with two other baseline state of the art coordinated and non-coordinated precoding schemes. Our results show that the gains of IA are very sensitive to CSI imperfections as compared to the other baselines. However, in case of the availability of high SINRs with very slow moving users leading to very large channel coherence time/bandwidth, IA outperforms the other schemes even with imperfect CSI. The results draw important conclusions about the application of IA in practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","startPage":"507","endPage":"511","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379121.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple model for imperfect channel state information and its application for the assessment of Interference Alignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Mathematical model","Channel estimation","Equations","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel coding","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect channel state information","interference alignment assessment","IA based transmit precoding","perfect channel state information","fully uncorrelated channels","CSI","3GPP compliant system level simulator","receiver algorithms","noncoordinated precoding schemes","coordinated precoding schemes","SINR","channel coherence time-bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A simple model for imperfect channel state information and its application for the assessment of Interference Alignment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379121/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379121/","accessionNumber":"13175380","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple model for imperfect channel state information and its application for the assessment of Interference Alignment","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p507aziz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051592S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6379122,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Akber Ali","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, KSA"],"lastName":"Mohammed Akber Ali","id":"37085980717"},{"name":"Samir Al-Ghadhban","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, KSA"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Al-Ghadhban","id":"38273969100"},{"name":"Ashraf S.

Instead, the Sphere Decoder (SD) was proposed as an efficient algorithm for finding the solution to the ML detection problem in MIMO digital communication systems. Unlike the ML detector whose complexity rises exponentially with the number of transmit and receive antennas, the complexity of the SD is polynomial for both finite and infinite lattices which makes real-time implementation of the ML detector practical. The choice of the initial radius for the SD has a significant impact on the complexity and the performance of the SD. However, the problem of selecting the initial radius is NP-hard itself. In this paper, we propose a simple Schnorr-Euchner SD (SE-SD) with a novel radius based on the received signal, noise statistics, number of transmit antennas, the energy of the transmitted symbols and on the channel matrix. The proposed method does not only reduce the complexity of the SD, but it also improves the bit error rate performance of the SD, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method, we compare our method with the conventional SD radius and with other methods proposed in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved sphere decoder for MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379126","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379126.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An improved sphere decoder for MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379126/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved sphere decoder for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p533kapfunde.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056687S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379127,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group-Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38529286700"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group-Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Detectors","Decoding","Accuracy","Transmitters","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive detection","linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems","hard-soft decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MLD","multiple-stream transmission","all-linear setup","linear transmitter-receiver","computational complexity","detection strategy","instantaneous channel condition","channel state information-transmitter","CSIT","ML detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Precoding","MIMO-OFDM","imperfect CSIT","maximum likelihood detection"]}],"abstract":"Maximum likelihood detection (MLD) has been shown to offer large performance gains within the context of linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with multiple-stream transmission when compared to an all-linear setup (i.e., linear transmitter/receiver), although at the cost of a higher computational complexity. To overcome this handicap, this paper proposes a method to selectively choose the detection strategy (ML or linear) as a function of the instantaneous channel conditions and the accuracy of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The proposed technique is suitable for both hard- and soft-decoded setups. Numerical results show that a cautious and selective use of ML detection substantially reduces complexity while still reaping most of the performance advantage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive detection in linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with hard/soft decoding","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379127","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379127.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive detection in linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with hard/soft decoding","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379127/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175386","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive detection in linearly precoded MIMO-OFDM systems with hard/soft decoding","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p538rierapalou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109392S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6379128,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Potentially, multiple users in the vehicle will compete for scarce spectral resources. At the same time, the direct link of users in the vehicle to the base stations might be rather week due to a high indoor-outdoor penetration loss. A potential solution to these this is the use of multi-antenna relays with antennas outside the vehicle for communication with the base stations and inside the vehicle for communication with the users. In order to increase the throughput on the base station - relay link, especially at cell edges, coordinated signal processing of multiple base stations could be used. In this work, we explore the performance of this approach in an uplink large-scale field trial of a multi-antenna transmitter carried on a measurement bus in an urban cellular environment. For this setup we show achievable data rates using linear and non-linear detection and explore the gain of joint detection in cooperation clusters of up to three base stations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379135/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175394","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Field trial results on uplink joint detection for moving relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field trial results on uplink joint detection for moving relays","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p586grieger.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044756S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6379149,"authors":[{"name":"Joumana Farah","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Joumana","lastName":"Farah","id":"37266691100"},{"name":"Anthony Beylerian","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Beylerian","id":"38529095600"},{"name":"Charles Yaacoub","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37392081100"},{"name":"Ralph Stephan","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, Faculty of Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Stephan","id":"37268269700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379149","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379149","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Relays","Wireless sensor networks","Joints","Sensors","Protocols","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","decode and forward communication","decoding","error statistics","network coding","pattern clustering","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","sensor fusion","turbo codes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data fusion techniques","multihop relay wireless sensor networks","protocol stack","multimedia applications","error propagation","decoding","amplify and forward relaying protocols","decode and forward relaying protocols","turbo codes","bit error rate performance","clustering nodes","multistream diversity","reduced relay complexity","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","data fusion","turbo-codes","cooperative networks"]}],"abstract":"Wireless sensor networks have gained considerable interest in the research community during the last decade.

Detection of spectrum holes is one of the first steps of implementing a cognitive radio system. Another step towards the feasibility and a real implementation of a cognitive radio network is the problem of location awareness. This problem arises when we do consider a realistic scenario in hybrid overlay/underlay systems, when these spectrum opportunities permit cognitive radios to transmit below the primary users tolerance threshold. In this case, the cognitive radio, have to estimate robustly the primary users locations in the network in order to adjust its transmission power function of the estimated location in the network. Adding to this the fact that in wideband radio one may not be able to acquire signals at the Nyquist sampling rate due to the current limitations in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) technology, we end up with a system that should, at a sub-Nyquist rate, properly recover the bands over which the primary users transmit and estimate their location in the network. In this paper 1, we proposed to analyze all these arisen problems. During the problem formulation and when analyzing more deeply the equations related to each question apart, we will make the link between the formulation of spectrum sensing, location awareness and the hardware limitation by describing those problems in a unique compressed sensing formalism. Via the proposed framework, we made it possible to overcame a challenging postulate of fixed frequency spectrum allocation by also estimating the spectrum usage boundaries in a blind way.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379155/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13175414","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379155/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A combined spectrum sensing and terminals localization technique for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A combined spectrum sensing and terminals localization technique for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p719guibene.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051604S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6379157,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Results indicate that non-line-of-sight conditions have a profoundly negative effect on location estimation accuracy, but that employing multiple future bandwidths as opposed to a single set of instantaneous bandwidths, does improve the situation, i.e. an average relative improvement in positional accuracy of 27%.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379157","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379157.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379157","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","startPage":"733","endPage":"738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TOA location estimation based on cognitive radio channel occupancy prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"TOA location estimation based on cognitive radio channel occupancy prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379157/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175416","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TOA location estimation based on cognitive radio channel occupancy prediction","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p733thomas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061634S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6379158,"authors":[{"name":"Chung Le","affiliation":["Institute of Conununications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Chung","lastName":"Le","id":"38005320500"},{"name":"Emil Dimitrov","affiliation":["Institute of Conununications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37679125300"},{"name":"Anggia Anggraini","affiliation":["Institute of Conununications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Anggia","lastName":"Anggraini","id":"37857903400"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Conununications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"},{"name":"Hans-Peter Kuchenbecker","affiliation":["Institute of Conununications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Kuchenbecker","id":"37268224600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379158","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","MIMO","Correlation","Interference","Nickel","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","correlation methods","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE-based interference alignment technique","MIMO channels","transmit antennas","receive antennas","MB-OFDM","multiband-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","receivers","BER performances","k-user MIMO interference channel","antenna spatial correlation effect","multiuser MIMO MB-OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference Alignment","MMSE","Multiuser MIMO MB-OFDM","UWB","Spatial Correlation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of antenna spatial correlation on the performance of K-user MIMO interference channel, in which interference alignment technique is employed to align all interferences at receivers.

The SNR and the sector angles depend on d, m, and the wavelength \u03bb. It turns out that for randomized antenna positions the analysis can be reduced to the analysis of a random geometric walk in two dimensions. The angle of the main beam is approximately \u03bb/d with a SNR proportional to \u221am. For the side beams the SNR is proportional to sinc(2\u03b1d=\u03bb) where \u03b1 denotes the angle deviating from the target. The range of the side beams is limited to an approximate angle of \u03bb/d\u221am.

The EPC is a mobile aggregation network standardized by 3GPP for deployment of fixed and 4G mobile broadband services, having interoperability features for 3G and 2G mobile services. While mobile networks already deploy a considerable amount of software control, the ability of OpenFlow to decouple the control and data planes for IP routing provides the opportunity to simplify the configuration and maintenance of mobile aggregation networks by eliminating the distributed IP routing control plane. We extend OpenFlow 1.2 with two vendor extensions, one defining virtual ports to allow encapsulation and decapsulation and another to allow flow routing using the GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID). The result enables an architecture where the GTP control plane can be lifted up out of network elements such as the Serving Gateway and the Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN Gateway) and moved into a controller running in a virtual machine in a data center. The EPC network elements then run a simplified OpenFlow control plane, enhanced with GTP TEID routing extensions. We discuss a few new features that are enabled with GTP TEID routing and the status of a prototype.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379165.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"791","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving the mobile Evolved Packet Core to the cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","IP networks","Routing","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","broadband networks","cloud computing","control engineering computing","internetworking","IP networks","open systems","software radio","telecommunication control","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile evolved packet core","software defined networking","SDN","mobile EPC control plane","data center","mobile aggregation network standardization","3GPP","4G mobile broadband services","interoperability features","2G mobile services","3G mobile services","software control","distributed IP routing control plane","OpenFlow 1.2","virtual ports","GTP tunnel endpoint identifier","GTP control plane","serving gateway","PDN gateway","packet data network gateway","virtual machine","GTP TEID routing extensions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolved Packet Core","GTP","OpenFlow","Software Defined Networking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Moving the mobile Evolved Packet Core to the cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379165/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175424","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving the mobile Evolved Packet Core to the cloud","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p784kempf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055041S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379174,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Fragkiadakis","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Fragkiadakis","id":"37282886300"},{"name":"Sofia Nikitaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece","Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Sofia","lastName":"Nikitaki","id":"38073443500"},{"name":"Panagiotis Tsakalides","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece","Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Tsakalides","id":"37298333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1430-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1429-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1428-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4894"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4886"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-4886"}],"articleNumber":"6379174","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"abstract":"The broadcast nature of wireless networks has been widely exploited by adversaries in order to cause severe denial-of-service attacks.

In this work, we combine recent advances in compressed sensing theory, along with a cumulative-sum anomaly-based algorithm, for the detection of physical-layer attacks. The algorithm considers a metric based on the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR). Compressed sensing makes feasible the use of far fewer SINR measurements for effective intrusion detection.

multi-hop relay networks (MRNs) can provide higher throughput and wider coverage, but it is impossible to guarantee quality of service (QoS) requirements for users at the cell edge and in hot spots due to severe co-channel interference (CCI) and load imbalance. This paper proposes an adaptive resource allocation scheme with a joint consideration of interference coordination (IC) & load balancing (LB), and analyzes the downlink of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based MRNs with time division duplex (TDD) mode. We present a novel frequency reuse scheme for MRNs to mitigate CCI and maintain high spectral efficiency. We also provide practical LB-based handover mechanisms to evenly distribute users and guarantee the users' QoS. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme not only satisfies the requirement of coverage probability, but also improves the throughput and accommodates more users in MRNs.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379179","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362315/6379056/06379179.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive resource allocation in OFDMA multi-hop relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379179/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive resource allocation in OFDMA multi-hop relay networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175438","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379179/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive resource allocation in OFDMA multi-hop relay networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"p92zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075403S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362315","isNumber":"6379056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362315","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6379056","articleId":"6379179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379211,"authors":[{"name":"Constantina Raluca Mihalache","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantina Raluca","lastName":"Mihalache","id":"38529345100"},{"name":"Mitica Craus","affiliation":["Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Mitica","lastName":"Craus","id":"37282694700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-606-834-846-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4534-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-606-834-848-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6379211","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Biological neural networks","Noise","Training","Noise measurement","Gray-scale","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feedforward neural nets","fuzzy set theory","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial feedforward neural network-based edge detection","fuzzy membership function-based edge detection","digital image processing","gray-scale image edge identification","supervised learning","gradient descent algorithm","neural network training patterns","generalization capability improvement","noisy images","noise-free images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379211","abstract":"Edge detection is an important problem in image processing.

Recently, with the introduction of advanced MEMS sensors and actuators and the penetration of new technologies in many diverse everyday tasks, with complicated control mechanisms and advanced calculations, it has been made clear that traditional PLCs need a technology boost. This boost can be offered by modern FPGA devices so a number of automated or semi-automated translating methodologies from PLC to FPGA have been proposed. This paper presents the effects of coding styles in a translation methodology using C-based hardware design and the corresponding high-level synthesis toolset. As it is shown, C-based hardware design offers optimization opportunities for floating point calculations not found in traditional HDL-based hardware design, provided specific coding guidelines are followed. These guidelines are integrated in a systematic translation methodology and their effects are compared to the effects of architectural optimizations offered by high-level synthesis. As shown in the experimental results, algorithmic optimizations (coding styles) clearly outperform architectural optimizations and so, their use is highly recommended for the development of next generation FPGA based controllers.","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365889/6379186/06379212.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"C-based PLC to FPGA translation and implementation: The effects of coding styles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"C-based PLC to FPGA translation and implementation: The effects of coding styles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379212/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379212/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175107","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-based PLC to FPGA translation and implementation: The effects of coding styles","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"icstcc2012131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068031S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365889","isNumber":"6379186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6379186","articleId":"6379212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Dunarea de Jos University","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379307,"authors":[{"name":"Mihaela Oprea","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Computers and Electronics, Petroleum-Gas University of Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"Oprea","id":"37296868100"},{"name":"Daniela \u015echiopu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Mathematics and Physics, Petroleum-Gas University of Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"\u015echiopu","id":"38529202700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-606-834-846-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4534-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-606-834-848-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6379307","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379307","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Automatic speech recognition","Cepstral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","natural language processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolated word speech recognition system","Romanian language","automatic speech recognition","feedforward artificial neural networks","feedforward ANN","vocal commands","electronic device control"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/6365889/6379186/06379307.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 16th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 16th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial neural network-based isolated word speech recognition system for the Romanian language","abstract":"Automatic speech recognition is a very difficult task to solve due to many factors that influence it (e.g. speaker pronounciation, noisy environment).

Bandwidth demand in our networks will continue to grow rapidly due to the increasing number of technology-intelligent users. Four main expectations from the users are high mobility, large data bandwidth, high quality of service (QoS), and ubiquitous coverage. The emerging optical and wireless access technologies are expected to provide these demands. Optical and wireless access networks have emerged to address two issues: channel capacity sharing fairly to the customers, and adequate capacity assignment according to service requirements. In this paper, the enabling optical and wireless broadband access technologies are presented and compared. The architectures, advantages, disadvantages, and main parameters of these access networks are discussed and reported. The hybrid wireless-optical broadband access technology is presented, which has many advantages to become the next-generation broadband access network. The concept and architecture of the hybrid wireless/optical broadband access technology are reviewed. The hybrid system developed at the Lightwave Communication Research Group (LCRG) is presented as a case study.

Motion estimation is one of the core designs of H.264 video coding, it basically includes the motion vector at quarter pixel resolution with variable block sizes and multiple reference frames, it mainly improves the image quality and provides more accurate predictions, however, because of these features, the computation load and complexity of motion estimation increase significantly. In this paper, a VLSI architecture for variable block size motion estimation with three step search algorithm is proposed. In order to improve the throughput, parallel architecture is adopted and the processing elements also allow the sums of absolute differences of larger blocks to be computed by using the results derived for 4\u00d74 blocks. The proposed method can obtain the motion vectors of different block size. Compared to the previous architectures for variable block size, our architecture can reduce the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379545","publicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365425/6379539/06379545.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for three-step search with variable block size motion vector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379545/","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for three-step search with variable block size motion vector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13187175","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379545/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for three-step search with variable block size motion vector","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"m1569613193tseng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073309S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365425","isNumber":"6379539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365425","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6379539","articleId":"6379545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6379546,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Hua Chen","affiliation":["Oriental Institute of Technology, Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi Hua Chen","id":"38529353600"},{"name":"Jue Hsuan Hsiao","affiliation":["Oriental Institute of Technology, Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jue Hsuan Hsiao","id":"37064927300"},{"name":"Jheng Shyuan He","affiliation":["Oriental Institute of Technology, Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jheng Shyuan He","id":"38258999300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1501-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1500-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1499-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6379546","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of LDPC encoder with approximate lower triangular matrix","abstract":"This study used the weight (3, 6) approximate lower triangular regular parity check matrix to implement the LDPC encoding on the 5641R FPGA of the Software Define Radio system developed by National Instruments (NI) [1].

In this paper, a Bayesian framework and its particle filtering (PF) implementation are introduced to cope with this problem. At each time step, the particles are sampled according to a random walk model, and then evaluated by the corresponding importance weights. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is incorporated to achieve an optimal importance sampling, by which the states are coarsely estimated and the particles are relocated. As such the particles are more likely drawn at the relevant area and can be resampled more efficiently. Experiments show that the proposed EKF-PF tracking algorithm significantly outperforms the traditional tracking approaches in challenging environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379576","publicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365425/6379539/06379576.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal importance sampling based particle filtering for channel parameter estimation in shallow ocean","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"An optimal importance sampling based particle filtering for channel parameter estimation in shallow ocean","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379576/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13187205","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379576/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal importance sampling based particle filtering for channel parameter estimation in shallow ocean","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p193xionghu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03929S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365425","isNumber":"6379539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365425","xplore-issue":"6379539","articleId":"6379576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6379577,"authors":[{"name":"Daejin Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daejin","lastName":"Park","id":"38003590900"},{"name":"Tag Gon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tag Gon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37351131500"},{"name":"Geunrae Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Geunrae","lastName":"Cho","id":"38529164700"},{"name":"Kwanghee Lee","affiliation":["V-TEAM, X-Business Unit, ABOV Semiconductor Company, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwanghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"38529354300"},{"name":"Changmin Kim","affiliation":["V-TEAM, X-Business Unit, ABOV Semiconductor Company, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"38008000600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1501-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1500-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1499-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6379577","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379577","abstract":"The microcontroller chip for motor driver, industrial appliance, and automotive chips are required to provide methods for detecting unsafe conditions by software-driven or hardware support, such as IEC-60730 qualification requirements.

WSNs use duty cycle to improve its power efficiency, and wake-up radio (WUR) is used as a control channel to wake up WSN nodes. With its highly flexible features, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is one of the attractive candidates for implementing part of WSN devices, and previous works have demonstrated its suitability. In this work, we propose a low-profile WUR scheme and implemented its receiver components using FPGA. The low-profile WUR wakes up the rest of the WUR module of the recipient node only and eliminate unnecessary WUR-module activation of non-recipient nodes. Experimental results of implementing module show that the proposed solution can significantly eliminate unnecessary power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on

The gesture motion includes three translations and one rotation. Each pixel of the event-based image sensor produces an event when temporal intensity change is larger than a pre-defined value. From the time-stamps of the events, a map of pseudo optical flow is calculated. The proposed algorithm achieves the gesture recognition based on this optical flow. It provides not only directions but also magnitudes of velocity. The proposed algorithm is memory-wise and computationally efficient because it uses only a current time-stamp map and local computation. This advantage will facilitate applications for mobile devices or on-chip development.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379606","publicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"The 1st IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6365425/6379539/06379606.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2012.6379606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four DoF gesture recognition with an event-based image sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Four DoF gesture recognition with an event-based image sensor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","accessionNumber":"13187235","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379606/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379606/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four DoF gesture recognition with an event-based image sensor","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p293lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040269S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6365425","isNumber":"6379539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6365425","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6379539","articleId":"6379606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6379607,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Asami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science for Integrated System Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Asami","id":"37565924100"},{"name":"Hayato Hagiwara","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science for Integrated System Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hayato","lastName":"Hagiwara","id":"38242585600"},{"name":"Mochimitsu Komori","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science for Integrated System Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Mochimitsu","lastName":"Komori","id":"37265792800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1501-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1500-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1499-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6379607","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual navigation system based on evolutionary computation on FPGA for patrol service robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379607","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Navigation","Image edge detection","Mobile robots","Field programmable gate arrays","Service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","edge detection","evolutionary computation","field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","path planning","robot vision","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual navigation system","evolutionary computation","patrol service robot","FPGA","image processing","reconfigurable device","image processing circuit","CMOS camera","feature points","edge extraction","filtering operations","real-time software applications","flexible hardware circuits","robot vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["evolutionary robotics","patrol service robot","image processing","genetic algorithm","visual navigation system"]}],"abstract":"The visual navigation system for a patrol service robot using image processing and evolutionary computation on FPGA is presented.

FSO has the capability to go beyond the limits of fiber optics. However, atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in the intensity of the received light signal, impairing link performance. In this paper, we describe a new technique to mitigate turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations, i.e., signal fading (under the effects of rain and haze). The new technique determines the priority in the optimization of transmission parameters to achieve highdata rate transmission with low link attenuation and bit-error rate. The results show that rain has a more detrimental effect than haze on the link attenuation. To compensate for increasing degradation of weather conditions, it is found that the transmission parameters should be optimized in descending order of priority from the optical amplifier gain to the laser power, data rate, aperture size and link range.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New priority-based parameter optimization technique for free space optics under bad weather conditions","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2012.6379822","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362335/6379517/06379822.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2012.6379822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"New priority-based parameter optimization technique for free space optics under bad weather conditions","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379822/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175939","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New priority-based parameter optimization technique for free space optics under bad weather conditions","confLoc":"Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569621685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049851S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362335","isNumber":"6379517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362335","xplore-issue":"6379517","articleId":"6379822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6379824,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Z.

But FSO is more preferred compared to fiber optics communication from the point of view of time and cost of deployment. FSO can transmit data from point to point at speed of light through space and requires no licensing. Since FSO is a line of sight communication so it is vulnerable to atmospheric attenuation, so to overcome this immense problem it is necessary to precisely study the channel characteristics present between the transmitter and receiver, especially for tropical climate region like Johor Bahru (JB) Malaysia, where rain and haze attenuation are the main concern. Many studies have been carried out in the temperate climate region where the attenuation due to snow and fog are the two major problems in the placement of FSO. The study in this paper concentrates on performance of single beam FSO system under heavy rain events for a period of four months from the point of view of attenuation and BER versus link distance L. The study is based on simulation and other atmospheric losses are not included. The results from the analysis have shown that under average of maximum rain rate intensities for the period of four months in typical Malaysian weather, single beam FSO system can successfully operate for a link distance of 830m with 19 dB/km attenuation and BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n.

However multiple wireless signals which have the same carrier frequency cannot propagate over a single optical fiber, such as MIMO signals feeding multiple antennas in the fiber wireless (FiWi) system. A novel optical single-sideband frequency translation (OSSB-FT) technique is proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, three wireless MIMO signals are designed to transport over a 20 km standard single mode fiber (SMF) using the OSSB-FT technique by one optical source. Each wireless MIMO signal is with a 2.44 GHz carrier frequency, 1 Gb/s data rate, and 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The crosstalk between the wireless MIMO signals is excluded, since each wireless MIMO signal is carried on a specific optical wavelength.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362335/6379517/06379840.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2012.6379840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2012.6379840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel optical single-sideband frequency translation technique for transmission of wireless MIMO signals over optical fiber","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical crosstalk","Wireless communication","MIMO","Optical fibers","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio access networks","radio-over-fibre","subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical single sideband frequency translation technique","wireless MIMO signal","optical fiber","carrier frequency","radio over fiber technique","multiple wireless signal","fiber wireless system","FiWi system","optical single-sideband frequency translation technique","standard single mode fiber","quadrature amplitude modulation","optical wavelength","frequency 2.44 GHz","distance 20 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel optical single-sideband frequency translation technique for transmission of wireless MIMO signals over optical fiber","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175957","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel optical single-sideband frequency translation technique for transmission of wireless MIMO signals over optical fiber","confLoc":"Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569638949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099055S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362335","isNumber":"6379517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6379517","articleId":"6379840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379848,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The sensitivity and accuracy of the sensor with and without gratings is observed as well as the effect of changing the grating distance on the resonant wavelength. The findings show that high sensitivity of above 500nm/RIU and a fourfold increase in signal to noise ratio (SNR) is obtained by introducing FBG to the basic fiber optic based SPR structure. Increasing the grating period results in a red shift in the resonant wavelength, thus enabling multiple sensor fabrication on a single fiber optic cable. Simulation of the FBG based SPR sensor to detect alcohol concentration from 0 to 100% in water is also demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362335/6379517/06379852.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2012.6379852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2012.6379852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber Bragg grating based surface plasmon resonance sensor utilizing FDTD for alcohol detection applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fiber gratings","Optical fibers","Optical fiber sensors","Gratings","Optical surface waves","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","chemical sensors","fibre optic sensors","finite difference time-domain analysis","optical cables","optical fibre fabrication","optical fibre theory","organic compounds","red shift","refractive index","surface plasmon resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber Bragg grating","surface plasmon resonance sensor","FBG SPR sensor","2D finite difference time domain simulation","FDTD simulation","grating distance","resonant wavelength","RIU","signal to noise ratio","SNR","basic fiber optic based SPR structure","grating period","red shift","sensor fabrication","single fiber optic cable","alcohol concentration detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surface Plasmon Resonance","Fiber Bragg Grating","miniature sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fiber Bragg grating based surface plasmon resonance sensor utilizing FDTD for alcohol detection applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6379852/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13175969","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber Bragg grating based surface plasmon resonance sensor utilizing FDTD for alcohol detection applications","confLoc":"Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569639539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056126S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362335","isNumber":"6379517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362335","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6379517","articleId":"6379852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6379853,"authors":[{"name":"A.

uplink communication in a Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) based multicell, multiuser system. The FFR principle is invoked for improving the cell-edge performance without reducing the throughput of the cell-center. Each cell is illuminated with the aid of six Remote Antennas (RAs), which are connected to the central base-station with the aid of realistically modelled imperfect optical-fiber links. When a Mobile Station (MS) is located at the cell-edge, the two nearest RAs can be invoked to detect and forward the user's signal to the base-station, based on the Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) principle. Furthermore, we design a Turbo Coded (TC) 16-level Star-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (StQAM) scheme for supporting optical-fiber-aided cooperative wireless transmission, where the receiver does not have to estimate the channel state information. Hence, a lower detection complexity can be achieved when compared to coherently detected schemes, albeit naturally, at a 3 dB power-loss. We also investigated the effect of phase-rotation imposed by imperfect optical-fiber links. We found that our noncoherent TC-StQAM scheme is robust to both wireless and optical-fiber imperfections.","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2012.6379891","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Photonics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362335/6379517/06379891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2012.6379891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379517","startPage":"267","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo-coded Star-QAM for cooperative wireless and optical-fiber communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turbo-coded Star-QAM for cooperative wireless and optical-fiber communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379891/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176007","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379891/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo-coded Star-QAM for cooperative wireless and optical-fiber communications","confLoc":"Pulau Pinang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569654083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084323S","chronDate":"1-3 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362335","isNumber":"6379517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6379517","articleId":"6379891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6379895,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

For higher-order \u0394\u03a3 modulator design, it is imperative to determine the optimal design parameters for realizing the maximum SNR while maintaining system stability, which requires the expertise of an experienced designer.

A common mobile cloud secure data service is to inquiry the data from sensing devices. The data can be collected from multiple requesters, which may drain out the power of sensing devices quickly. Thus, an efficient data access control model is desired. To this end, we present a comprehensive security data inquiry framework for mobile cloud computing. Our solution focuses on the following two research directions: First, we present a novel Privacy Preserving Cipher Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (PP-CP-ABE) to protect sensing data. Using PP-CP-ABE, light-weight devices can securely outsource heavy encryption and decryption operations to cloud service providers, without revealing the data content. Second, we propose an Attribute Based Data Storage (ABDS) system as a cryptographic group-based access control mechanism. Our performance assessments demonstrate the security strength and efficiency of the presented solution in terms of computation, communication, and storage.","publicationTitle":"2012 8th international conference on network and service management (cnsm) and 2012 workshop on systems virtualiztion management (svm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th international conference on network and service management (cnsm) and 2012 workshop on systems virtualiztion management (svm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362369/6379984/06379990.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and secure data storage operations for mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and secure data storage operations for mobile cloud computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379990/","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379990/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and secure data storage operations for mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0699178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111898S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362369","isNumber":"6379984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362369","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6379984","articleId":"6379990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6379995,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Bouillard","affiliation":["INRIA, ENS Cachan, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Bouillard","id":"38526153500"},{"name":"Aurore Junier","affiliation":["IRISA, INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Aurore","lastName":"Junier","id":"38529254400"},{"name":"Benoit Ronot","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Ronot","id":"38529239900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-3134-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-48-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-9605"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-963X"}],"articleNumber":"6379995","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"abstract":"Nowadays one of the challenges of telecommunication systems management is to detect in real-time unexpected or hidden malfunctions in extremely complex environments.

Non-invasive diagnosis of performance problems is the key capability for overlay service management in order to adapt to dynamic network conditions in a timely manner. Existing overlay diagnosis approaches assume extensive knowledge about the network, and require monitoring sensors or active measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel diagnosis technique to localize performance anomalies and determine the packet loss contribution for each network component. Our approach is purely based on endpoint packet loss observations to reason about the location of observed packet loss without active probing or sensor deployment. We formulate the problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem using constraints derived from network loss invariants and end-user observations. Our solution also circumvents the possibilities of insufficient or malicious end-user participation. We evaluate our approach extensively using simulation and experimentation, and demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and scalability of our approach for various network sizes, participation levels and spurious amounts.","publicationTitle":"2012 8th international conference on network and service management (cnsm) and 2012 workshop on systems virtualiztion management (svm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 8th international conference on network and service management (cnsm) and 2012 workshop on systems virtualiztion management (svm)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6362369/6379984/06379996.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6379984","startPage":"91","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-grain diagnosis of overlay performance anomalies using end-point network experiences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6379996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fine-grain diagnosis of overlay performance anomalies using end-point network experiences","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6379996/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13176022","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6379996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grain diagnosis of overlay performance anomalies using end-point network experiences","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"rp1298334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087067S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6362369","isNumber":"6379984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6362369","xplore-issue":"6379984","articleId":"6379996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"}]
