The evolutionary algorithm used here is a random optimization method (ROM). In particular, deterministic mutation (DM) is introduced in ROM. It is performed on the basis of the result of neural network learning. The DM procedure can evolve a candidate of a solution to increase a ROM fitness function in a deterministic manner. In the paper iris data are used as inputs. ROM are utilized to reduce the number of connection weights in the neural network. The network weights survived after the ROM training represent rules to perform pattern classification for the iris data. The rules are then extracted from the networks in which hidden units use signum and sigmoid functions to produce binary outputs. It enables us to extract simple logical functions from the network. Simulation results show this approach can generate a simple network structure and as a result simple rules.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1999.790106","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1393 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"FUZZ-IEEE'99. 1999 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems.

For measurement data evaluation and for controller design also the inverse models are of considerable interest. The inverse models can be utilized either as a direct compensation of some measurement nonlinearity, or as a controller mechanism for nonlinear plants. In this paper an improved technique for fuzzy model inversion is introduced. Multiple-input single-output (MISO) forward fuzzy models are considered, where inversion is performed simply by interchanging the role of the output and one of the inputs. The proposed method is based on a simple nonlinear state observer, which reconstructs the selected input of a system, represented by a forward fuzzy model, from its output and the remaining inputs using an appropriate prediction-correction type control strategy and a copy of the fuzzy model itself. The overall performance of the suggested technique is highly influenced by the nature of the nonlinearity and the actual prediction-correction mechanism applied. The novelty of this paper is the introduction of genetic algorithms to control the iterative model inversion.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1999.790112","pdfPath":"/iel5/6417/17140/00790112.pdf","startPage":"1421","endPage":"1426 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"FUZZ-IEEE'99. 1999 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems.

By using these criteria we can avoid critical area errors, and a node can take a single operation per iteration. The simulation results show that the genetic learning algorithm and n-nodes maintenance method developed in the paper is effective.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizing","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Computer architecture","Euclidean distance","Error analysis","Robustness","Genetic mutations","Pattern recognition","Data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","self-organising feature maps","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["n-rule genetic self organizing map","n-rule representation","n-rule inference","n-nodes maintenance rules","node overlapping prevention","genetic operation","genetic learning algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790177","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1999.790177","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1784 vol.3","publicationTitle":"FUZZ-IEEE'99. 1999 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems.

This means that there is a need for methods and models to identify troublesome components. We apply a model for classification of software components as green, yellow and red according to the number of times they required corrective maintenance over successive releases. Further, we apply a principal component and box plot analysis to investigate the causes for the code decay and try to characterize the releases. The case study includes eight releases and 130 software components. The outcome indicates a large number of healthy components as well as a small set of troublesome components requiring extensive repair repeatedly. The analysis characterizes the releases and indicates that it is the relationship between components that causes many of the problems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.1999.790190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17136","startPage":"69","endPage":"81 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

The mathematical formalism is illustrated by applying the analysis to the performance of a multicarrier DS-CDMA system over Nakagami-m fading.

Antenna hopping is one approach for using transmit antennas to obtain diversity gain. With antenna hopping, cyclic or pseudo-random hopping is used to transform spatial diversity into time diversity which can be exploited by appropriate error correction codes and interleaving techniques. Unfortunately, this incurs latency due to the interleaving requirements and/or possible bandwidth expansion due to the error correction code. To alleviate this problem we propose decision-directed antenna hopping where the antenna selected for transmission is a function of the current and past data. This enables diversity gain without constellation expansion, bandwidth expansion, of interleaving, similar in spirit to space-time trellis codes. We illustrate our idea with simple 2, 4, 8, and 16 state codes which achieve a rate of 1 b/s/HZ with two transmit antennas. Analytical calculations and simulations assuming perfect channel knowledge are used to characterize performance of these codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit diversity using decision-directed antenna hopping","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Communications Theory Mini-Conference (Cat.

Our reverse link detector suppresses the MAI and ISI with a feedforward filter (FFF) which linearly processes the samples at the output of parallel chip matched filters (CMFs), and a feedback filter (FBF) which linearly processes detected symbols. We propose a fully-connected (FC) architecture whose synergy arises from sharing FFF and FBF contents among users to enable efficient multiuser recursive least-squares (RLS) adaptation towards the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) coefficients. Simulations validate the theoretical BER analysis and demonstrate that the FC detector trains in several hundred symbols, avoids severe error propagation, and supports 8 simultaneous 2 Mb/s QPSK users in an asynchronous CDMA system with a processing gain of 8, a delay spread of 1.25 /spl mu/s, an average SNR of 15 dB, with uncoded BERs less than 10/sup -4/ and 10/sup -3/ with 97% and 99.3% probabilities, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Communications Theory Mini-Conference (Cat.

It is a trellis based algorithm that provides soft information on the input and output of an FSM, with linear complexity on the decision delay D (or the observation length N). When parametric uncertainty is present, the need for adaptive SISOs arises. The proposed solutions either oversimplify the parameter model, or result in exponential complexity on D. In this paper, the exact expression for the soft metrics in the presence of parametric uncertainty modeled as a deterministic constant is rederived in a novel way. Based on this expression, suboptimal algorithms with linear complexity on D and N are presented. The applicability of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated with two examples, namely serially concatenated convolutional codes (SCCC) with carrier phase tracking, and trellis coded modulation (TCM) in frequency-selective fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/CTMC.1999.790260","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Communications Theory Mini-Conference (Cat.

Motivated by applications such as novel view generation and motion-compensated compression, we suggest that the ability to predict new views or frames is a natural metric for evaluating such algorithms. Our new metric has several advantages over comparing algorithm outputs to true motions or depths. First of all, it does not require the knowledge of ground truth data, which may be difficult or laborious to obtain. Second, it more closely matches the ultimate requirements of the application, which are typically tolerant of errors in uniform color regions, but very sensitive to isolated pixel errors or disocclusion errors. In the paper we develop a number of error metrics based on this paradigm, including forward and inverse prediction errors, residual motion error and local motion-compensated prediction error. We show results on a number of widely used motion and stereo sequences, many of which do not have associated ground truth data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction error as a quality metric for motion and stereo","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790301","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790301.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"788 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Prediction error as a quality metric for motion and stereo","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365338","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction error as a quality metric for motion and stereo","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077049S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"64","articleId":"790301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790306,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Needless to say, in any outdoor application, there is no escape from \"bad\" weather. Ultimately, computer vision systems must include mechanisms that enable them to function (even if somewhat less reliably) in the presence of haze, fog, rain, hail and snow. We begin by studying the visual manifestations of different weather conditions. For this, we draw on what is already known about atmospheric optics. Next, we identify effects caused by bad weather that can be turned to our advantage. Since the atmosphere modulates the information carried from a scene point to the observer it can be viewed as a mechanism of visual information coding. Based on this observation, we develop models and methods for recovering pertinent scene properties, such as three-dimensional structure, from images taken under poor weather conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790306","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790306.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"827 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision in bad weather","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Vision in bad weather","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790306/","publicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6365343","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision in bad weather","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024291S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"374","articleId":"790306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":790308,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

Rather than recovering a single estimate of the illuminant as many previous authors have done, in the first instance we recover a measure of the likelihood that each possible illuminant was the scene illuminant. We do this by correlating image colours with the colours that can occur under each of a set of possible lights. We then recover an estimate of the scene illuminant based on these likelihoods. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop in this paper. We develop a new probabilistic instantiation of this framework which delivers very good colour constancy on synthetic and real images. We show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it; e.g. the grey-world and gamut mapping algorithms. We explore too the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790308","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790308.pdf","startPage":"835","endPage":"842 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Colour by correlation: a simple, unifying approach to colour constancy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Colour by correlation: a simple, unifying approach to colour constancy","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6371235","publicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Colour by correlation: a simple, unifying approach to colour constancy","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034846S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"51","articleId":"790308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790317,"authors":[{"name":"A.

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790346","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Nonlinear filters","Peak to average power ratio","Pixel","Image analysis","Testing","Humans","Computer science","Image recognition","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image texture","computational geometry","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cue integration","image segmentation","gray-level images","putative elementary units","texture perception","image partitioning algorithm","disjoint regions","coherent brightness","contour orientation energy","texton densities","oriented linear filter outputs","K-means approach","pixel mapping","texton channels","point set","discrete techniques","Voronoi diagrams","local histograms","texton frequencies","texture boundaries","natural images","textured regions","untextured regions","Gaussian derivative filters","cue combination","gating operator","statistical test","Delaunay neighbors","spectral graph theoretic framework","normalized cuts"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790346.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"925 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790346","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Textons, contours and regions: cue integration in image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790346/","displayDocTitle":"Textons, contours and regions: cue integration in image segmentation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365354","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Textons, contours and regions: cue integration in image segmentation","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041972S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"141","articleId":"790346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790354,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790354/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6365362","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation using eigenvectors: a unifying view","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation using eigenvectors: a unifying view","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026679S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"369","articleId":"790354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790355,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.S.

In contrast to much of the previous work on layer based motion modeling, which compute layered descriptions of 2D image motion, our work leads to a 3D description of the scene. We focus on the key problem of automatically segmenting the scene into layers as a precursor to recovery of stereo disparity data. The prior assumptions about the scene are formulated within a Bayesian decision making framework, and are then used to automatically determine the number of layers and the assignment of individual pixels to layers. Although using a collection of 3D layers has been previously proposed as an efficient and effective representation for multimedia applications, results to date have relied on hand segmentation. In contrast, the work described aims at fully automatic segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790355","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790355.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"990 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated Bayesian approach to layer extraction from image sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790355/","displayDocTitle":"An integrated Bayesian approach to layer extraction from image sequences","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365363","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated Bayesian approach to layer extraction from image sequences","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048966S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"18","articleId":"790355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790379,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790379","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790379.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790379.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790379","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1017 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing surfaces using three-dimensional textons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing surfaces using three-dimensional textons","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790379/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365366","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing surfaces using three-dimensional textons","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054828S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"111","articleId":"790379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790383,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

However, to facilitate sequential inference (e.g. over time or scale) and to allow the representation of ambiguity, it is desirable to represent an entire probability distribution for object location. Although the cross correlation itself (or some function of it) has sometimes been treated as a probability distribution, this is not generally justifiable. Bayesian correlation achieves a consistent probabilistic treatment by combining several developments. The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions in probabilistic terms, as observation likelihoods. Second, probability distributions of filter bank responses are learned from training examples. Inescapably, response learning also demands statistical modelling of background intensities, and there are links here with image coding and Independent Component Analysis. Lastly, multi scale processing is achieved in a Bayesian context by means of a new algorithm, layered sampling, for which asymptotic properties are derived.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1075 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790391.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790391","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Image analysis","Electrical capacitance tomography","Image sampling","Probability","Filter bank","Read only memory","Image coding","Motion pictures","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","Bayes methods","probability","optimisation","correlation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object localization","Bayesian correlation","cross correlation maximisation","intensity based object localization","sequential inference","ambiguity","probability distribution","object location","consistent probabilistic treatment","correlation matching functions","probabilistic terms","observation likelihoods","probability distributions","filter bank responses","training examples","response learning","statistical modelling","background intensities","image coding","Independent Component Analysis","multi scale processing","Bayesian context","layered sampling","asymptotic properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Object localization by Bayesian correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790391/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object localization by Bayesian correlation","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03113S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"76","articleId":"790391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":790398,"authors":[{"name":"S.

People are modeled as an assembly of nine cylindrical segments. Segments are found using an EM algorithm and then assembled into hypotheses incrementally, using a learned likelihood model. Each assembly step passes on a set of samples of its likelihood to the next; this yields effective pruning of the space of hypotheses. The collection of available nine-segment hypotheses is then represented by a set of equivalence classes, which yield an efficient pruning process. The posterior for the number of people is obtained from the class representatives. People are counted quite accurately in images of real scenes using a MAP estimate. We show the method allows top-down as well as bottom up reasoning. While the method can be overwhelmed by very large numbers of segments, we show that this problem can be avoided by quite simple pruning steps.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790398","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790398.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1097 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding people by sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Finding people by sampling","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365377","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790398/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding people by sampling","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025892S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"21","articleId":"790398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":790407,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Extended Kalman filters have commonly been applied to kinematic variables, to combine predictions consistent with plausible motion, with the incoming stream of visual measurements. Kalman filtering is applicable only when the underlying distribution is approximately Gaussian. Often this assumption proves remarkably robust. There are two pervasive circumstances under which the Gaussianity assumption can break down. The first is kinematic singularity and the second is at joint endstops. Failure of Kalman filtering under these circumstances is illustrated. The non-Gaussian nature of the distributions is demonstrated experimentally by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Random simulation (particle filtering or Condensation) proves to provide a robust alternative algorithm for tracking that can also deal with these difficult conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790409","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1149 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790409.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking through singularities and discontinuities by random sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Tracking through singularities and discontinuities by random sampling","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6365385","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790409/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking through singularities and discontinuities by random sampling","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035302S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"49","articleId":"790409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":790410,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790410","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1157 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790410.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object recognition from local scale-invariant features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790410/","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Object recognition from local scale-invariant features","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6365386","publicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object recognition from local scale-invariant features","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032598S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"7386","articleId":"790410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":790415,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

In practice, images are subjected to randomly selected transformations of a known nature, such as translation and rotation. Direct use of the above methods will lead to severely blurred components that tend to ignore the more interesting and useful structure. In previous work, we introduced a clustering algorithm that is invariant to transformations. In this paper, we propose a method called transformed component analysis, which incorporates a discrete, hidden variable that accounts for transformations and uses the expectation maximization algorithm to jointly extract components and normalize for transformations. We illustrate the algorithm using a shading problem, facial expression modeling and written digit recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformed component analysis: joint estimation of spatial transformations and image components","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.790415","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17141/00790415.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1196 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.790415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Transformed component analysis: joint estimation of spatial transformations and image components","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6365391","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformed component analysis: joint estimation of spatial transformations and image components","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00790415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02589S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"48","articleId":"790415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790416,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains.

The basis of this function is a configural and dynamical manifold that summarizes the target system's behaviour. This manifold can be modeled from data with a hidden Markov model having special topological properties that we obtain via entropy minimization. Inference is then a matter of solving for the geodesic on the manifold that best explains the evidence in the cue sequence. We give a closed-form maximum a posteriori solution for geodesics through the learned density space, thereby obtaining optimal paths over the dynamical manifold. These methods give a completely general way to perform inference over time-series; in vision they support analysis, recognition, classification and synthesis of behaviours in linear time.

We proposed two iterative algorithms, the R-SD and the R-LMS, to generate the desired image sequence. These algorithms assume the knowledge of the blur, the down-sampling, the sequences motion, and the measurements noise characteristics, and apply a sequential reconstruction process. It has been shown that the computational complexity of these two algorithms makes both of them practically applicable. In this paper, we rederive these algorithms as approximations of the Kalman filter and then carry out a thorough analysis of their performance. For each algorithm, we calculate a bound on its deviation from the Kalman filter performance. We also show that the propagated information matrix within the R-SD algorithm remains sparse in time, thus ensuring the applicability of this algorithm. To support these analytical results we present some computer simulations on synthetic sequences, which also show the computational feasibility of these algorithms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17189/00790425.pdf","doi":"10.1109/34.790425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.790425","startPage":"817","endPage":"834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-resolution reconstruction of image sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790425/","displayDocTitle":"Super-resolution reconstruction of image sequences","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"6373148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-resolution reconstruction of image sequences","sourcePdf":"00790425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02791S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"162","articleId":"790425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790427,"authors":[{"name":"I.T.

By parameterized gesture we mean gestures that exhibit a systematic spatial variation; one example is a point gesture where the relevant parameter is the two-dimensional direction. Our approach is to extend the standard hidden Markov model method of gesture recognition by including a global parametric variation in the output probabilities of the HMM states. Using a linear model of dependence, we formulate an expectation-maximization (EM) method for training the parametric HMM. During testing, a similar EM algorithm simultaneously maximizes the output likelihood of the PHMM for the given sequence and estimates the quantifying parameters. Using visually derived and directly measured three-dimensional hand position measurements as input, we present results that demonstrate the recognition superiority of the PHMM over standard HMM techniques, as well as greater robustness in parameter estimation with respect to noise in the input features. Finally, we extend the PHMM to handle arbitrary smooth (nonlinear) dependencies. The nonlinear formulation requires the use of a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for both training and the simultaneous recognition of the gesture and estimation of the value of the parameter. We present results on a pointing gesture, where the nonlinear approach permits the natural spherical coordinate parameterization of pointing direction.","doi":"10.1109/34.790429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17189/00790429.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.790429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric hidden Markov models for gesture recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790429/","displayDocTitle":"Parametric hidden Markov models for gesture recognition","volume":"21","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6373152","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric hidden Markov models for gesture recognition","sourcePdf":"00790429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056824S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"366","articleId":"790429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":790438,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In our method, each fuzzy if-then rule is handled as an individual, and a fitness value is assigned to each rule. Thus, our method can be viewed as a classifier system. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy if-then rules and fuzzy reasoning for pattern classification problems. Then we explain a genetics-based machine learning method that automatically generates fuzzy if-then rules for pattern classification problems from numerical data. Because our method uses linguistic values with fixed membership functions as antecedent fuzzy sets, a linguistic interpretation of each fuzzy if-then rule is easily obtained. The fixed membership functions also lead to a simple implementation of our method as a computer program. The simplicity of implementation and the linguistic interpretation of the generated fuzzy if-then rules are the main characteristic features of our method. The performance of our method is evaluated by computer simulations on some well-known test problems. While our method involves no tuning mechanism of membership functions, it works very well in comparison with other classification methods such as nonfuzzy machine learning techniques and neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/3477.790443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.790443","endPage":"618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17166/00790443.pdf","startPage":"601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of fuzzy classifier systems for multidimensional pattern classification problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790443/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of fuzzy classifier systems for multidimensional pattern classification problems","volume":"29","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6378363","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18252338","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of fuzzy classifier systems for multidimensional pattern classification problems","sourcePdf":"00790443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057057S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"344","articleId":"790443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790446,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In FALC, the training datum with the maximum approximation error is selected as the center of a fuzzy rule.

Emphasis is given to the modeling of the soft-tissue deformations induced by the growth of tumors and its application to the registration of anatomical atlases, with images from patients presenting such pathologies. First, an estimate of the anatomy prior to the tumor growth is obtained through a simulated biomechanical contraction of the tumor region. Then a normal-to-normal atlas registration to this estimated pre-tumor anatomy is applied. Finally, the deformation from the tumor-growth model is applied to the resultant registered atlas, producing an atlas that has been deformed to fully register to the patient images. The process of tumor growth is simulated in a nonlinear optimization framework, which is driven by anatomical features such as boundaries of brain structures. The deformation of the surrounding tissue is estimated using a nonlinear elastic model of soft tissue under the boundary conditions imposed by the skull, ventricles, and the falx and tentorium. A preliminary two-dimensional (2-D) implementation is presented in this paper, and tested on both simulated and patient data. One of the long-term goals of this work is to use anatomical brain atlases to estimate the locations of important brain structures in the brain and to use these estimates in pre-surgical and radiosurgical planning systems.","doi":"10.1109/42.790458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17169/00790458.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.790458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1999","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear elastic registration of brain images with tumor pathology using a biomechanical model [MRI]","volume":"18","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1999","accessionNumber":"6372132","pubMedId":"10504092","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790458/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear elastic registration of brain images with tumor pathology using a biomechanical model [MRI]","sourcePdf":"00790458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042626S","chronDate":"July  1999","isNumber":"17169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"118","articleId":"790458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":790463,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The first step in automating this process is to cluster together the pixels within each organ or tissue type. The authors propose to form images based on second-order statistical texture transforms (Haralick transforms) of a CT or MRI scan. The original scan plus the suite of texture transforms are then input into a Hopfield neural network (HNN). The network is constructed to solve an optimization problem, where the best solution is the minima of a Lyapunov energy function. On a sample abdominal CT scan, this process successfully clustered 79-100% of the pixels of seven abdominal organs. It is envisioned that this is the first step to automate segmentation. Active contouring (e.g., SNAKE's) or a back-propagation neural network can then be used to assign names to the clusters and fill in the incorrectly clustered pixels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6372137","pubMedId":"10504097","volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Abdominal organ segmentation using texture transforms and a Hopfield neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Abdominal organ segmentation using texture transforms and a Hopfield neural network","sourcePdf":"00790463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060709S","chronDate":"July  1999","isNumber":"17169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"43","articleId":"790463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790464,"authors":[{"name":"P.N.

Prior work on active and programmable networking at this level either achieves flexibility by inserting significant software in the critical path of forwarding or achieves efficiency by sacrificing functionality and relegating programmability to connection management. In contrast, control-on-demand acts both in the control plane and in the data plane, still without adding software in the critical forwarding path. Rather than applying essential programs to every datagram, our approach is to apply the installed service logic asynchronously from data forwarding. This way we avoid essential processing in the critical forwarding path, applying the (user) installed service logic for service enhancement only. In this paper, we describe control-on-demand and how its service model provides sufficient richness to act in the data path. Set is restrictive enough to avoid the significant performance overhead of other in-data path approaches. The expressiveness of the programmable model is limited to observing and suggesting to the forwarding engine, but is never essential for correct processing, thus significantly reducing security and robustness concerns. Consequently, control-on-demand is efficient enough to make it viable for elementary services. Rather than replacing the interoperability layer, control-on-demand represents an evolution of router (switch) control functionality. As the required modification of router forwarding engines is insignificant, control-on-demand is viable in practice in the near future. These concepts have been prototyped as part of the Pronto Control Platform. In this paper, we describe our IPv6 router prototype implementation and discuss the application of control-on-demand on a number of interesting problems.","doi":"10.1109/49.790481","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790481.png","startPage":"1549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17168/00790481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.790481","endPage":"1562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control-on-demand: an efficient approach to router programmability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Control-on-demand: an efficient approach to router programmability","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6378400","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control-on-demand: an efficient approach to router programmability","sourcePdf":"00790481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041114S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","articleId":"790481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":790486,"authors":[{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Baochun Li","id":"37280003300"},{"name":"K.

These complex applications are desired to adapt themselves and to adjust their resource demands dynamically. On one hand, current adaptation mechanisms built within an application cannot preserve global properties such as fairness; on the other hand, adaptive resource management mechanisms built within the operating system are not aware of data semantics in the application. In this paper, we present a novel middleware control framework to enhance the effectiveness of quality-of-service (QoS) adaptation decisions by dynamic control and reconfiguration of internal parameters and functionalities of a distributed multimedia application. Our objective is to satisfy both system-wide properties (such as fairness among concurrent applications) and application-specific requirements (such as preserving the critical performance criteria). The framework is modeled by the task control model and the fuzzy control model, based on rigorous results from the control theory, and verified by the controllability and adaptivity of a distributed visual tracking application. The results show validation of the framework, i.e., critical application quality parameters can be preserved via controlled adaptation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6378405","volume":"17","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A control-based middleware framework for quality-of-service adaptations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A control-based middleware framework for quality-of-service adaptations","sourcePdf":"00790486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042068S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"196","articleId":"790486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790498,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The system uses standard unmodified grasper shafts and tips. The FREG can control grasping forces either by surgeon teleoperation control, or under software control. The FREG performance was evaluated using an automated palpation function (programmed series of compressions) in which the grasper measures mechanical properties of the grasped materials. The material parameters obtained from measurements showed the ability of the FREG to discriminate between different types of normal soft tissues (small bowel, lung, spleen, liver, colon, and stomach) and different kinds of artificial soft tissue replication materials (latex/silicone) for simulation purposes. In addition, subjective tests of ranking stiffness of silicone materials using the FREG teleoperation mode showed significant improvement in the performance compared to the standard endoscopic grasper. Moreover, the FREG performance was closer to the performance of the human hand than the standard endoscopic grasper. The FREG as a tool incorporating the force feedback teleoperation technology may provide the basis for application in telesurgery, clinical endoscopic surgery, surgical training, and research.","doi":"10.1109/10.790498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17164/00790498.pdf","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.790498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force controlled and teleoperated endoscopic grasper for minimally invasive surgery-experimental performance evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790498/","displayDocTitle":"Force controlled and teleoperated endoscopic grasper for minimally invasive surgery-experimental performance evaluation","volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6373024","pubMedId":"10513126","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force controlled and teleoperated endoscopic grasper for minimally invasive surgery-experimental performance evaluation","sourcePdf":"00790498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043087S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"258","articleId":"790498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790506,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

In this paper, a class of multichannel maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) receivers is developed for this purpose. Interference mitigation is accomplished via adaptive antenna arrays, while multipath propagation is combated via MLSE. Practical considerations are included, such as fixed front-end filtering, sampling, and estimation of parameters from received samples. Maximal ratio combining, conventional array processing and metric combining (MC) are shown to be special cases of the proposed receivers. Performance is evaluated for /spl pi//4-shift DQPSK, using the parameters and transmission format of the time-division multiple-access (TDMA)-based IS-136 (D-AMPS) digital cellular standard. Semi-analytical performance predictions are developed which confirm simulation trends. The results show that these receivers can operate at significantly lower carrier-to-interferer (C/I) levels than conventional MC receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","volume":"48","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6379098","displayDocTitle":"Interference cancellation with an array processing MLSE receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference cancellation with an array processing MLSE receiver","sourcePdf":"00790506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045095S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","articleId":"790506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":790507,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An adaptive array receiver is presented which integrates multiuser detection, beamforming, and RAKE reception to mitigate cochannel interference and fading. The adaptive multiuser detector is formulated using a blind constrained energy minimization criterion and adaptation is carried out using a novel algorithm based on set-membership parameter estimation theory. The proposed detector overcomes the shortcomings of conventional LMS- and RLS-type algorithms, namely, that of slow convergence and large computational load, respectively. This is especially the case when strong interferers are present or when the number of adaptive weights is relatively large. DS-CDMA systems can have a relatively large number of spatially distributed interferers. Thus beamforming is based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates provided by an approximate maximum-likelihood estimator (DOA-MLE). Unlike previous approaches, the DOA-MLE exploits the structure of the DS-CDMA signaling scheme resulting in robust performance and simple implementation in the presence of angle spreading. The overall method is suitable for real-time implementation and can substantially improve the interference suppression capabilities of a CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/25.790508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790508.pdf","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multiuser detection and beamforming for interference suppression in CDMA mobile radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790508/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multiuser detection and beamforming for interference suppression in CDMA mobile radio systems","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379100","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multiuser detection and beamforming for interference suppression in CDMA mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00790508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045828S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","articleId":"790508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":790509,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The other system reuses all the spectrum in all cells 1/1, but does not reuse channels within a cell. Thus, the maximum number of users in the two systems is the same. In order to account for the interference, the 1/3 system directs antenna pattern nulls against same cell cochannel users, while the 1/1 system directs nulls against cochannel users in other cells. The performances of the two systems are compared as a function of the azimuth angular width (seen from the base) of the multipaths generated at the mobile, using simulations and analytical derivations.

In the proposed system, instead of identical DS waveforms being transmitted over a number of subchannels in parallel, each user's DS waveform is transmitted over the user's favourite subchannel which has the largest fading amplitude among all the subchannels.

Thus for a given upper limit on transmit power, the coverage of a cell is inversely proportional to the number of users in it.

Our analysis may be used in cellular planning to set hard limits on the number of users admitted into the cell in order to meet coverage requirements. Furthermore, our approach allows us to arrive at a precise definition for the pole capacity of a cell, which serves as an upper bound on the number of users a cell can support as the coverage shrinks to zero.

In a beam diversity system, multiple receiving branches are formed with multiple antenna beams with distinctive patterns. These beams are synthesized in such a fashion that the fading phenomena observed at different branches are nearly uncorrelated. The disadvantage of such a system is the lack of adaptivity for cochannel interference (CCI) suppression. In this paper, an adaptive beam diversity combiner is proposed for sectorized signal reception. The diversity branches are formed with several adaptive beamformers whose response patterns encompass an angular sector in the field-of-view of the receiver. With a set of judiciously chosen weight vectors, effective diversity combining can be achieved inside the sector, and out-of-sector CCI can be suppressed via nulling. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/25.790525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790525.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sectorized beamspace adaptive diversity combiner for multipath environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790525/","displayDocTitle":"A sectorized beamspace adaptive diversity combiner for multipath environments","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379117","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sectorized beamspace adaptive diversity combiner for multipath environments","sourcePdf":"00790525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036918S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","articleId":"790525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790527,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper deals with a method to track mobiles by on-line monitoring of field strength data of surrounding base stations at successive time points. Such data is available in present global system for mobile communication (GSM) systems each 0.48 s and also in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems for transmission control. Because of strong random fluctuations of the signals, appropriate smoothing is the key point of the procedure.

Decision feedback channel estimation (DFCE) is considered, in which the past L-received signal samples are remodulated to remove the modulation phase by feeding back the detected symbol sequence and then averaged. Analytical expressions for the conditional BER for the given transmitted symbol sequence are derived, and the average BER performances are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that as L increases, the BER performance improves and approaches that of ideal coherent detection (with perfect channel estimation), and the loss in E/sub b//N/sub 0/ required for BER=0.1% relative to ideal coherent detection becomes as small as 0.4 dB when L=10. It is found that while the best performance is achieved by 2PSK and 4PSK when additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is the predominant cause of error (i.e., low E/sub b//N/sub 0/ regions), 16QAM modulation can achieve almost the same performance as 4PSK when the delay spread is the predominant cause of error (i.e., large E/sub b//N/sub 0/ regions), and the worst performance in this case is by 2PSK. The effects of power delay profile shape (double-spike, exponential, and Gaussian profiles assumed), rolloff factors of the Nyquist transmit/receive filters, and the transmitted symbol sequence pattern on the average BER performance are discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER analysis of 2PSK, 4PSK, and 16QAM with decision feedback channel estimation in frequency-selective slow Rayleigh fading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.790531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790531.pdf","startPage":"1563","endPage":"1572","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790531.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"BER analysis of 2PSK, 4PSK, and 16QAM with decision feedback channel estimation in frequency-selective slow Rayleigh fading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379123","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER analysis of 2PSK, 4PSK, and 16QAM with decision feedback channel estimation in frequency-selective slow Rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"00790531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045508S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","articleId":"790531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790535,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, as the fading rate becomes more rapid, it is difficult to provide an exact interpolation with conventional PSAM. To compensate for the fast Rayleigh fading, a PSAM which calculates in the frequency domain rather than the time domain as in conventional PSAM is proposed. Although this PSAM scheme only needs the zero interpolation for fading estimation, it provides a very accurate estimate even in relatively fast Rayleigh fading environments. We introduce this PSAM using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and apply it to 16QAM and then show some results of computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/25.790540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790540.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rayleigh fading compensation for 16QAM using FFT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790540/","displayDocTitle":"Rayleigh fading compensation for 16QAM using FFT","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379129","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rayleigh fading compensation for 16QAM using FFT","sourcePdf":"00790540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02973S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","articleId":"790540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790542,"authors":[{"name":"Do Jun Rhee","affiliation":["LSI Logic Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Do Jun Rhee","id":"37273586000"},{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"lastName":"Shu Lin","id":"37276533700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"790542","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790542","abstract":"This paper presents a bandwidth-efficient multilevel concatenated-coded modulation scheme for reliable data transmission over the shadowed mobile satellite communication (MSAT) channel.

On the other hand, this scheme is very sensitive to the signal distortion generated by the imperfect frequency down conversion at the receiver due to the local oscillator phase noise and frequency offset. In this work, we consider the MC-CDMA architecture that was independently proposed in Yee et al. (1993) and Falsafi et al. (1996), and, in particular, we evaluate the impact of both the carrier frequency offset and the phase noise on the system performance. The results are given in terms of symbol error rate (SER) obtained by means of an analytical approach for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. However, the procedure can be applied to the performance evaluation in the presence of a multipath fading channel as part of a semianalytical approach. This approach offers a realistic means of performance evaluation when the target error probability values are of the order of 10/sup -6/ or lower.","doi":"10.1109/25.790546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790546.pdf","startPage":"1657","endPage":"1665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of the MC-CDMA access scheme to carrier phase noise and frequency offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of the MC-CDMA access scheme to carrier phase noise and frequency offset","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6379132","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of the MC-CDMA access scheme to carrier phase noise and frequency offset","sourcePdf":"00790546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057132S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"67","articleId":"790546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790549,"authors":[{"name":"Junhong Nie","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Junhong Nie","id":"37352904500"},{"name":"S.

In particular, we propose an alternative approach to solving the dynamic channel assignment (DCA) problem through a form of real-time reinforcement learning known as Q learning. Instead of relying on a known teacher, the system is designed to learn an optimal assignment policy by directly interacting with the mobile communication environment. The performance of the Q-learning-based DCA was examined by extensive simulation studies on a 49-cell mobile communication system under various conditions including homogeneous and inhomogeneous traffic distributions, time-varying traffic patterns, and channel failures. Comparative studies with the fixed channel assignment (FCA) scheme and one of the best dynamic channel assignment strategies (MAXAVAIL) have revealed that the proposed approach is able to perform better than the FCA in various situations and is capable of achieving a similar performance to that achieved by MAXAVAIL, but with a significantly reduced computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790549.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.790549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Q-learning-based dynamic channel assignment technique for mobile communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Traffic control","Dynamic programming","Neural networks","Costs","Learning","Time varying systems","Computational complexity","Radio spectrum management","Process planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","telecommunication computing","cellular radio","telecommunication traffic","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q-learning-based dynamic channel assignment technique","mobile communication systems","DCA problem","real-time reinforcement learning","optimal assignment policy","Q-learning-based DCA","homogeneous traffic distributions","inhomogeneous traffic distribution","time-varying traffic patterns","channel failures","performance","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"A Q-learning-based dynamic channel assignment technique for mobile communication systems","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Q-learning-based dynamic channel assignment technique for mobile communication systems","sourcePdf":"00790549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027984S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"98","articleId":"790549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790550,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is a hybrid forward-error-correction (FEC)/automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) scheme, based on the adaptive coding technique using incremental redundancy of Mandelbaum (1974). The FEC code is a rate-compatible punctured and shortened Reed-Solomon (RS) code, used for error correction only. The scheme is most attractive in situations where error occurrences are almost independent between the recipients of the messages. The throughput performance of the NSR protocol is analyzed in terms of all the parameters involved. Analysis shows that NSR significantly outperforms all the existing pure ARQ broadcast schemes. It is also shown that, even with a large number of recipients, NSR achieves performance which stays close to the capacity of the broadcast q-ary erasure channel, where q=2/sup m/ and m is the size in bits of a transmitted packet. Furthermore, on slow Rayleigh fading channels, this protocol is expected to provide better throughput performance than other hybrid ARQ protocols.","doi":"10.1109/25.790550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17170/00790550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.790550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17170","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient hybrid ARQ protocol for point-to-multipoint communication and its throughput performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient hybrid ARQ protocol for point-to-multipoint communication and its throughput performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379135","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient hybrid ARQ protocol for point-to-multipoint communication and its throughput performance","sourcePdf":"00790550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044499S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","articleId":"790550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790551,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Results of the experiments carried out with synthetic instances of the scheduling problem show that our knowledge-augmented algorithm produces much better results in terms of quality of solutions, although being slower in terms of execution time.","doi":"10.1109/71.790600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/17172/00790600.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.790600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling multiprocessor tasks with genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling multiprocessor tasks with genetic algorithms","volume":"10","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6362668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling multiprocessor tasks with genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00790600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042547S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"116","articleId":"790600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790601,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The real-time simulation capability of a hardware emulator could significantly improve the performance of fault grading, which is one of the most time consuming tasks in the circuit design and test process. We employ a serial fault emulation algorithm enhanced by two speed-up techniques. First, a set of independent faults can be injected and emulated at the same time. Second, multiple dependent faults can be simultaneously injected within a single FPGA-configuration by adding extra circuitry. Because the reconfiguration time of mapping the numerous faulty circuits into the FPGA's is pure overhead and could be the bottleneck of the entire process, using extra circuitry for injecting a large number of faults can reduce the number of FPGA-reconfigurations and, thus, improving the performance significantly. In addition, we address the issue of handling potentially detected faults in this hardware emulation environment by using the dual-railed logic. The performance estimation shows that this approach could be several orders of magnitude faster than the existing software approaches for large sequential designs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.790625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17165","startPage":"1487","endPage":"1495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17165/00790625.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault emulation: A new methodology for fault grading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault emulation: A new methodology for fault grading","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6377683","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault emulation: A new methodology for fault grading","sourcePdf":"00790625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035465S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"50","articleId":"790625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":790630,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

As noted in previous work, the combination of the source encoder and channel can often be modeled as a hidden Markov model. This statistical framework is the basis for state estimation and minimum mean-square error estimation procedures for JSC decoding, and it can also be used to develop channel state and channel parameter estimation methods.

The partitioning is based on a separation of the variable-length (VL) coded discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients within each block. The scheme is suitable for constant bit-rate transmission (CBR), where the fraction of bits assigned to each of the two partitions can be adjusted according to the requirements of the unequal error-protection scheme employed. The distribution of the VL-coded (VLC) information between the two partitions is performed adaptively. Subsequently, the partitioning method was applied to the ITU-T H.263 coding standard. It was shown that, for the input video with quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) spatial resolution (or less), the partitioning overhead can be embedded in the B-bit code word representing the group number (GN), thus avoiding transmission of additional bits. As a transport vehicle, we have considered one of the leading third generation cellular radio standards known as wide-band code division multiple access (W-CDMA). A dual-priority transmission system is then invoked on the W-CDMA system where the video data, after being broken into two streams, are unequally protected. We use a very simple error-correction coding scheme for illustration and then propose more sophisticated forms of unequal protection of the digitized video signals. We show that this strategy results in a significantly higher quality of the reconstructed video data when they are transmitted over time-varying multipath fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/5.790635","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1763","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/17162/00790635.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.790635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipriority video transmission for third-generation wireless communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Multiaccess communication","Discrete cosine transforms","Robustness","Spatial resolution","Vehicles","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Code standards","Wideband","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual communication","code division multiple access","cellular radio","telecommunication standards","video coding","source coding","transform coding","variable length codes","discrete cosine transforms","code standards","broadband networks","multiuser channels","multipath channels","time-varying channels","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipriority video transmission","third-generation wireless communication systems","robust dual-priority video partitioning method","twin-class unequal protected video transmission","wireless channels","variable-length coded DCT coefficients","discrete cosine transform","constant bit-rate transmission","CBR","unequal error-protection","ITU-T H.263 coding standard","input video","quarter common intermediate format","QCIF spatial resolution","partitioning overhead","code word","group number","cellular radio standards","wide-band code division multiple access","W-CDMA","dual-priority transmission system","video data","error-correction coding","digital video signals","reconstructed video data","time-varying multipath fading channels","source coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Multipriority video transmission for third-generation wireless communication systems","volume":"87","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6388625","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790635/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipriority video transmission for third-generation wireless communication systems","sourcePdf":"00790635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072061S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"37","articleId":"790635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790636,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In addition, the high-end receiver could use soft outputs and source-controlled channel decoding for even better performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.790636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17162","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/17162/00790636.pdf","endPage":"1777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel coding and transmission aspects for wireless multimedia","doi":"10.1109/5.790636","startPage":"1764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790636","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Channel coding and transmission aspects for wireless multimedia","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790636/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6388626","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"87","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel coding and transmission aspects for wireless multimedia","sourcePdf":"00790636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044727S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"62","articleId":"790636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":790637,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to provide these services to mobile users, an appropriate transmission technique has to cope with frequency-selective and time-variant radio channels. The computation complexity for an equalizer increases in a frequency-selective radio channel for high data rate applications. Furthermore, the overhead for channel estimation procedures increases in time-variant channels. To overcome these drawbacks orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered for broadband applications in many publications. The objective of this paper is to describe the large potential, the flexibility and adaptivity of the OFDM transmission technique in frequency-selective and time variant radio channels. Several technical aspects of OFDM transmission systems are discussed, especially the topics of differential modulation for which we compare different demodulation methods and channel coding with soft decision decoding. For higher level differential modulation, multilevel coding is taken into consideration.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

services over a bandlimited mobile channel with the emphasis of wireless asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cell design, spreading code management, and the impact of CDMA systems on the video services. Such services allow users to share novel MPEG-2 video applications without any geographical restrictions. The ATM technique is especially well suited for variable bit rate (VBR) MPEG-2 video because of its ability to allocate bandwidth on demand to these services. However, since the mobile radio has a limited channel capacity, the overall capacity of the traditional ATM-based CDMA system may not be sufficient to accommodate the MPEG-2 video services requested by the multiple mobile users simultaneously. To tackle this difficulty, a multicode CDMA technique is proposed to provide multiple VBR MPEG-2 video services by varying the number of spreading codes assigned to each MPEG-2 video in order to meet its dynamic throughput requirement. Moreover, both the multipath fading and interference on CDMA radio channels tend to cause significant transmission error and MPEG-2 bit streams are very vulnerable to these errors. Powerful forward error connection (FEC) codes are therefore necessary to protect the video data so that it can be successfully transmitted at acceptable signal power level. Two separate FEC code schemes are applied to the header and payload of an ATM cell containing MPEG-2 video data, respectively. The ATM cell header is protected by a relatively powerful FEC code to ensure the low average cell loss rate (CLR). On the other hand, the ATM cell payload is encoded for varying degrees of error protection according to both the priority and statistical behavior of the payload data in MPEG-2 videos. An adaptive FEC code combining scheme is proposed to provide good protection cell payload data with the maximization of its code rate in order to minimize the extra bandwidth for FEC overhead. Two typical MPEG2 test sequences are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our system.","doi":"10.1109/5.790639","startPage":"1807","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/17162/00790639.pdf","endPage":"1824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.790639","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790639/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless ATM-based multicode CDMA transport architecture for MPEG-2 video transmission","volume":"87","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6388629","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless ATM-based multicode CDMA transport architecture for MPEG-2 video transmission","sourcePdf":"00790639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04676S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"13","articleId":"790639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790648,"authors":[{"name":"Yifeng Zhou","affiliation":["Electronic Support Measures Section, Defence Research Establishment, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Yifeng Zhou","id":"37273640100"},{"name":"P.C.

The approach is to estimate the initial MTS by maximizing the likelihood function of the array data. The tracking is implemented by prediction through the target motion dynamics using the initial MTS estimate. By incorporating the target motion dynamics, the algorithm is able to eliminate the spread spectrum effects due to target motion.

The proposed beamformer is a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) with a new adaptive blocking matrix using coefficient-constrained adaptive filters (CCAFs) and a multiple-input canceller with norm-constrained adaptive filters (NCAFs). The CCAFs minimize leakage of the target-signal into the interference path of the GSC. Each coefficient of the CCAFs is constrained to avoid mistracking. The input signal to all the CCAFs is the output of a fixed beamformer. In the multiple-input canceller, the NCAFs prevent undesirable target-signal cancellation when the target-signal minimization at the blocking matrix is incomplete. The proposed beamformer is shown to be robust to target-direction errors as large as 200 with almost no degradation in interference-reduction performance, and it can be implemented with several microphones. The maximum allowable target-direction error can be specified by the user. Simulated anechoic experiments demonstrate that the proposed beamformer cancels interference by over 30 dB. Simulation with real acoustic data captured in a room with 0.3-s reverberation time shows that the noise is suppressed by 19 dB. In subjective evaluation, the proposed beamformer obtains 3.8 on a five-point mean opinion score scale, which is 1.0 point higher than the conventional robust beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6380441","volume":"47","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A robust adaptive beamformer for microphone arrays with a blocking matrix using constrained adaptive filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust adaptive beamformer for microphone arrays with a blocking matrix using constrained adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"00790650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041196S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"203","articleId":"790650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790651,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

We address this problem for linear prediction, but instead of fixing a specific model order, we develop a sequential prediction algorithm whose sequentially accumulated average squared prediction error for any bounded individual sequence is as good as the performance attainable by the best sequential linear predictor of order less than some M. This predictor is found by transforming linear prediction into a problem analogous to the sequential probability assignment problem from universal coding theory. The resulting universal predictor uses essentially a performance-weighted average of all predictors for model orders less than M.

Our main motivation is the application in block-transform-based image coding. Besides having all of the attractive properties of other lapped orthogonal transforms, the new transform takes advantage of its long, overlapping basis functions to represent smooth signals in order to reduce blocking artifacts, whereas it reserves short basis functions for high-frequency signal components like edges and texture, thereby limiting ringing artifacts. Two design methods are presented, each with its own set of advantages: the first is based on a direct lattice factorization, and the second enforces certain relationships between the lattice coefficients to obtain variable length filters.

Stack smoothers define a large class of nonlinear smoothers based on positive Boolean functions (PBF) applied in the binary domain of threshold decomposition. Although stack smoothers can offer some advantages over traditional linear FIR filters, they are in essence smoothers lacking the flexibility to adequately address a number of signal processing problems that require bandpass or highpass filtering characteristics. In this paper, mirrored threshold decomposition is introduced, which, together with the associated binary PBF, define the significantly richer class of stack filters. Using threshold logic representation, a number of properties of stack filters are derived. Notably, stack filters defined in the binary domain of mirrored threshold decomposition require the use of double weighting of each sample in the integer domain. The class of recursive stack filters and the corresponding recursive weighted median (RWM) filters in the integer domain admitting negative weights are introduced. The new stack filter formulation leads to a more powerful class of estimators capable of effectively addressing a number of fundamental problems in signal processing that could not adequately be addressed by prior stack smoother structures.","doi":"10.1109/78.790657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2757","endPage":"2767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17167/00790657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.790657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stack filters, stack smoothers, and mirrored threshold decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Signal processing","Statistics","Laboratories","Boolean functions","Nonlinear filters","Filtering","Logic","Signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stack filters","recursive filters","filtering theory","signal processing","Boolean functions","median filters","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive weighted median filters","stack smoothers","mirrored threshold decomposition","signal processing","nonlinear smoothers","positive Boolean functions","binary domain","linear FIR filters","highpass filtering","bandpass filtering","threshold logic representation","double weighting","recursive stack filters","integer domain","negative weights"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Stack filters, stack smoothers, and mirrored threshold decomposition","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6380448","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790657/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stack filters, stack smoothers, and mirrored threshold decomposition","sourcePdf":"00790657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034498S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"790657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":790658,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

Their rich properties and tractability make them an intriguing component of such systems, often describing the large-scale or long-term behavior of natural systems, or the information content in certain communication or signal processing systems. However, it is often difficult to detect or estimate the parameters of solitons in such systems due to the presence of strong nonsoliton components or the nonlinear interaction of multiple solitons. The objective of this paper is to develop and investigate the detection and estimation of soliton signals. As a framework for this study, we consider using these nonlinear systems as both signal generators and signal processors in a form of multiplexed soliton communication. In contrast to more conventional uses of solitons in a communications context, our communication system uses soliton systems for signal generation and multiplexing for transmission over traditional linear channels. In addition to their mathematical tractability and the simplicity of the analog circuits used to generate and process them, we show that the soliton signal dynamics may also provide a mechanism for decreasing transmitted signal energy while enhancing signal detection and parameter estimation performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790658/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6380449","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection and estimation of multiplexed soliton signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and estimation of multiplexed soliton signals","sourcePdf":"00790658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051876S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","articleId":"790658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790659,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Our formalism applies to an extended class of convolution-based signal approximation techniques, which includes interpolation, generalized sampling with prefiltering, and the projectors encountered in wavelet theory. We claim that we can predict the L/sup 2/-approximation error by integrating the spectrum of the function to approximate-not necessarily bandlimited-against a frequency kernel E(/spl omega/) that characterizes the approximation operator. This prediction is easier yet more precise than was previously available. Our approach has the remarkable property of providing a global error estimate that is the average of the true approximation error over all possible shifts of the input function. Our error prediction is exact for stationary processes, as well as for bandlimited signals. We apply this method to the comparison of standard interpolation and approximation techniques. Our method has interesting implications for approximation theory. In particular, we use our results to obtain some new asymptotic expansions of the error as T/spl rarr/0, as well as to derive improved upper bounds of the kind found in the Strang-Fix (1971) theory. We finally show how we can design quasi-interpolators that are near optimal in the least-squares sense.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Fourier analysis of approximation techniques. I.

In a previous paper, we proposed a general Fourier method that provides an accurate prediction of the approximation error, irrespective of the scaling properties of the approximating functions. Here, we apply our results when these functions satisfy the usual two-scale relation encountered in dyadic multiresolution analysis. As a consequence of this additional constraint, the quantities introduced in our previous paper can be computed explicitly as a function of the refinement filter. This is, in particular, true for the asymptotic expansion of the approximation error for biorthonormal wavelets as the scale tends to zero. One of the contributions of this paper is the computation of sharp, asymptotically optimal upper bounds for the least-squares approximation error. Another contribution is the application of these results to B-splines and Daubechies (1988, 1992) scaling functions, which yields explicit asymptotic developments and upper bounds. Thanks to these explicit expressions, we can quantify the improvement that can be obtained by using B-splines instead of Daubechies wavelets. In other words, we can use a coarser spline sampling and achieve the same reconstruction accuracy as Daubechies. Specifically, we show that this sampling gain converges to /spl pi/ as the order tends to infinity.","doi":"10.1109/78.790660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17167/00790660.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.790660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17167","startPage":"2796","endPage":"2806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Fourier analysis of approximation techniques.

First, we propose theoretical results and prove that in the general case, it is not possible to separate the sources without nonlinear distortion. Therefore, we focus our work on specific nonlinear mixtures known as post-nonlinear mixtures. These mixtures constituted by a linear instantaneous mixture (linear memoryless channel) followed by an unknown and invertible memoryless nonlinear distortion, are realistic models in many situations and emphasize interesting properties i.e., in such nonlinear mixtures, sources can be estimated with the same indeterminacies as in instantaneous linear mixtures. The separation structure of nonlinear mixtures is a two-stage system, namely, a nonlinear stage followed by a linear stage, the parameters of which are updated to minimize an output independence criterion expressed as a mutual information criterion. The minimization of this criterion requires knowledge or estimation of source densities or of their log-derivatives. A first algorithm based on a Gram-Charlier expansion of densities is proposed. Unfortunately, it fails for hard nonlinear mixtures. A second algorithm based on an adaptive estimation of the log-derivative of densities leads to very good performance, even with hard nonlinearities. Experiments are proposed to illustrate these results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17167/00790661.pdf","startPage":"2807","endPage":"2820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.790661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.790661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Nonlinear distortion","Memoryless systems","Mutual information","Adaptive estimation","Entropy","Neural networks","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","adaptive signal processing","probability","memoryless systems","array signal processing","multilayer perceptrons","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-nonlinear mixtures","source separation","mutually independent sources","two-stage system","linear instantaneous mixture","linear memoryless channel","invertible memoryless nonlinear distortion","nonlinear stage","linear stage","mutual information criterion","output independence criterion minimization","source densities","Gram-Charlier expansion","hard nonlinear mixtures","adaptive estimation","log-derivatives","performance","experiments","PDF","probability distribution function","sensor array","multilayer perceptrons","unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6380452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source separation in post-nonlinear mixtures","sourcePdf":"00790661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053826S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"190","articleId":"790661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790662,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The principle behind DAT is that conventional signal processing systems are designed for the worst case and are not energy-optimum on average. Therefore, significant energy savings can be achieved by optimally reconfiguring the hardware in these situations. Practical reconfiguration strategies for adaptive filters are presented. These strategies are derived as a solution to an optimization problem. The optimization problem has energy as the objective function and a constraint on the algorithm performance (specifically the SNR). The DAT-based adaptive filter is employed as an equalizer for a 51.84 Mb/s very high speed digital subscriber loop (VDSL) over 24-pair BKMA cable. The channel nonstationarities are due to variations in cable length and number of far end crosstalk (FEXT) interferers. For this application, the traditional design is based on 1 kft cable length and 11 FEXT interferers. It was found that up to 81% energy savings can be achieved when cable length varies from 1-0.1 kft and the number of FEXT interferers varies from 11 to 4. On the average, 53% energy savings are achieved as compared with the conventional worst-case design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic algorithm transforms for low-power reconfigurable adaptive equalizers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.790662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17167/00790662.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.790662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic algorithm transforms for low-power reconfigurable adaptive equalizers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6380453","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic algorithm transforms for low-power reconfigurable adaptive equalizers","sourcePdf":"00790662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043709S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","articleId":"790662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":790664,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Chiang Ho","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kwok-Chiang Ho","id":"37347983200"},{"name":"Kah-Chye Tan","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Kah-Chye Tan","id":"37348253800"},{"name":"A.

The \"Elefant\" (ELEctronics For Amplitude 'N Timing) Digitizer IC is designed to measure both the charge and the single electron time of arrival of sense wire signals from the BaBar drift chamber. By combining a FADC (flash analog-to-digital converter) and a TDC (time-to-digital converter) for each channel, the digitizer IC can be optimized and simplified, to achieve the physics goals required of the drift chamber while reducing the per channel costs of the electronics. The Elefant IC also implements portions of the BaBar trigger protocols to simplify the connection of the chip to the rest of the BaBar detector. Each IC contains eight complete independent channels. The circuit has been implemented in a 0.8 /spl mu/m triple metal CMOS process and fabricated in production quantity to fully instrument the BaBar drift chamber and are now in operation. Performance results of the IC will be presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6372984","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of the Elefant digitizer IC for the BaBar drift chamber","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of the Elefant digitizer IC for the BaBar drift chamber","sourcePdf":"00790679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078685S","chronDate":"Aug.  1999","isNumber":"17197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","articleId":"790679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":790687,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Therefore the transformer manufacturers have to face new specifications linked with these requirements. As these requirements are different from country to country, we can expect different approaches for the different markets. ISO and IEC have issued guides to consider these aspects. As ester or vegetable fluids are more expensive in comparison with mineral oil, it is important to optimize the design of the windings in order to take all the benefits of such modern fluids, beside the fire behavior and the other environmental aspects (toxicity, water pollution, waste treatment, etc). The use of ester fluids is common now, and much experience has been accumulated during the last decade. The vegetable oil is a new candidate to replace mineral oils in the future. Therefore this report is mostly dedicated to this new technology which represents a promising market. The development of a biodegradable electrical insulating fluid from high oleic vegetable oil sources is described. This type of oil was selected due to the inherent higher stability of high oleic oils over commercial grade oils. However, the selected oil had to be further purified to improve electrical properties, and special additives were used to enhance the oxidative stability in the environment of electrical equipment. The electrical equipment specifically targeted for immediate use was distribution transformers.","doi":"10.1049/ic:19990669","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Insulating Liquids (Ref.

Cache replacement algorithms play a central role in the response time reduction by selecting a subset of documents for caching, so that a given performance metric is maximized. At the same time, the cache must take extra steps to guarantee some form of consistency of the cached documents. Cache consistency algorithms enforce appropriate guarantees about the staleness of the cached documents. We describe a unified cache maintenance algorithm, LNC-R-WS-U, which integrates both cache replacement and consistency algorithms. The LNC-R-WS-U algorithm evicts documents from the cache based on the delay to fetch each document into the cache. Consequently, the documents that took a long time to fetch are preferentially kept in the cache. The LNC-R-W3-U algorithm also considers in the eviction consideration the validation rate of each document, as provided by the cache consistency component of LNC-R-WS-U. Consequently, documents that are infrequently updated and thus seldom require validations are preferentially retained in the cache. We describe the implementation of LNC-R-W3-U and its integration with the Apache 1.2.6 code base. Finally, we present a trace-driven experimental study of LNC-R-W3-U performance and its comparison with other previously published algorithms for cache maintenance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790804/","volume":"11","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6362608","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Proxy cache algorithms: design, implementation, and performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proxy cache algorithms: design, implementation, and performance","sourcePdf":"00790804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057049S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"99","articleId":"790804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790808,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The detector design is based on two layers of scintillation crystals in the z-axis with different physical properties, such as light decay time or light yield. This makes it feasible to assign the depth of interaction (DOI) information in order to be able to correct for spatial degradation in PET or to operate the detector in PET or SPECT mode. The pixel DOI detectors are cost effectively arranged in a block design. In this work the authors discuss the possibility of separating events from the two different layers in the time domain using pulse shape discrimination or in the energy domain using pulse height discrimination. Furthermore, the authors have investigated the feasibility of interdetector scatter suppression using pulse shape discrimination. The measurements have been done using a LSO/LSO high resolution PET detector, a LSO and GSO crystal in coincidence and a NaI(TI)/LSO combined PET/SPECT detector. The investigations show, that the pulse shape discrimination technique has a significant higher identification probability compared to the pulse height discrimination and does make a interdetector scatter detection feasible.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.790808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17198","startPage":"985","endPage":"990","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17198/00790808.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advantages using pulse shape discrimination to assign the depth of interaction information (DOI) from a multi layer phoswich detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Advantages using pulse shape discrimination to assign the depth of interaction information (DOI) from a multi layer phoswich detector","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379058","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advantages using pulse shape discrimination to assign the depth of interaction information (DOI) from a multi layer phoswich detector","sourcePdf":"00790808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05204S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","articleId":"790808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":790812,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hui Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Hui Chang","id":"37365267600"},{"name":"Ching-Chi Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Chi Hsu","id":"37069890400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-4347"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2191"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3865"}],"articleNumber":"790812","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":270},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Information retrieval","World Wide Web","Web sites","Performance evaluation","Data mining","Information systems","Terminology","Vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relevance feedback","information resources","Internet","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concept-based relevance feedback","information retrieval","World Wide Web","keyword-based querying","document ranking","Web information retrieval","clustering techniques","search results","concept-based browsing","user interface designs","performance","similarity ranking","Internet"]}],"abstract":"The World Wide Web is a world of great richness, but finding information on the Web is also a great challenge. Keyword-based querying has been an immediate and efficient way to specify and retrieve related information that the user inquires. However, conventional document ranking based on an automatic assessment of document relevance to the query may not be the best approach when little information is given, as in most cases. In order to clarify the ambiguity of the short queries given by users, we propose the idea of concept-based relevance feedback for Web information retrieval. The idea is to have users give two to three times more feedback in the same amount of time that would be required to give feedback for conventional feedback mechanisms. Under this design principle, we apply clustering techniques to the initial search results to provide concept-based browsing. We show the performance of various feedback interface designs and compare their pros and cons. We measure precision and relative recall to show how clustering improves performance over conventional similarity ranking and, most importantly, we show how the assistance of concept-based presentation reduces browsing labor.","doi":"10.1109/69.790812","startPage":"595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/17192/00790812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.790812","endPage":"609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling concept-based relevance feedback for information retrieval on the WWW","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"Enabling concept-based relevance feedback for information retrieval on the WWW","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6362611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling concept-based relevance feedback for information retrieval on the WWW","sourcePdf":"00790812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043915S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"37","articleId":"790812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790816,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Liu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Ling Liu","id":"37280776600"},{"name":"C.

Continual queries are standing queries that monitor update of interest and return results whenever the update reaches specified thresholds. In OpenCQ, users may specify to the system the information they would like to monitor (such as the events or the update thresholds they are interested in). Whenever the information of interest becomes available, the system immediately delivers it to the relevant users; otherwise, the system continually monitors the arrival of the desired information and pushes it to the relevant users as it meets the specified update thresholds. In contrast to conventional pull-based data management systems such as DBMSs and Web search engines, OpenCQ exhibits two important features: it provides push-enabled, event-driven, content-sensitive information delivery capabilities; and it combines pull and push services in a unified framework. By event-driven we mean that the update events of interest to be monitored are specified by users or applications. By content-sensitive, we mean the evaluation of the trigger condition happens only when a potentially interesting change occurs. By push-enabled, we mean the active delivery of query results or triggering of actions without user intervention.","doi":"10.1109/69.790816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/17192/00790816.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.790816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continual queries for Internet scale event-driven information delivery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"Continual queries for Internet scale event-driven information delivery","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6362612","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continual queries for Internet scale event-driven information delivery","sourcePdf":"00790816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066448S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"99","articleId":"790816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790818,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

The authors find that both pre- and post-injection transmission provide accurate estimates of attenuation correction factors. Post-injection estimates for mean attenuation coefficients and specific activities in larger regions of interest (ROIs) are nearly the same as pre-injection values, but exhibit 17-18% greater pixel standard deviation.

This would particularly benefit studies such as cardiac SPECT where patient motion during long acquisitions can lead to motion artifacts in the reconstructed images. To this end, the authors have investigated sinogram pre-processing techniques designed to enable filtered backprojection (FBP) to produce high-quality reconstructions from a small number of views. Each projection is first smoothed by performing roughness-penalized nonparametric regression using a generalized linear model that explicitly accounts for the Poisson statistics of the data. The resulting fit curves are natural cubic splines. After smoothing, additional angular views are generated using periodic spline interpolation, and images are reconstructed using FBP. The algorithm was tested on data from SPECT studies of a cardiac phantom placed at various radial offsets to enable examination of the algorithm's dependence on the radial extent of the object being imaged.","doi":"10.1109/23.790845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17198/00790845.pdf","startPage":"1121","endPage":"1128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.790845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Few-view tomography using roughness-penalized nonparametric regression and periodic spline interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790845/","displayDocTitle":"Few-view tomography using roughness-penalized nonparametric regression and periodic spline interpolation","volume":"46","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379078","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Few-view tomography using roughness-penalized nonparametric regression and periodic spline interpolation","sourcePdf":"00790845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049398S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"3","articleId":"790845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":790868,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Real-time operating characteristics are determined for two commercially available 4 Nm interior PM synchronous machines. Special computer assisted measuring techniques are employed using an experimental vector controlled drive, capable of providing sinusoidal excitation waveforms at up to 8000 RPM. Perturbation analysis is performed on the measured data and results are applied to a variation of the classical d-q axis equivalent circuit model. The experimental results are repeatable and show a significant variation in the machine parameters as a function of the torque angle. Magnetic nonlinearities are also identified and accounted for through recomputation of the machine model over a wide range of operating points. The authors demonstrate that all tests can be performed with no previous knowledge of manufacturer proprietary information or results from finite element simulation.","doi":"10.1109/60.790901","startPage":"486","endPage":"492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17195/00790901.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.790901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic motor parameter identification for high speed flux weakening operation of brushless permanent magnet synchronous machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Synchronous machines","Performance evaluation","Synchronous motors","Drives","Magnetic analysis","Performance analysis","Equivalent circuits","Torque","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless machines","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","parameter estimation","machine testing","automatic testing","electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless PM synchronous motors","dynamic motor parameter identification","high speed flux weakening operation","real-time operating characteristics","interior PM synchronous machines","measurement automation","vector control","sinusoidal excitation waveforms","perturbation analysis","classical d-q axis equivalent circuit model","torque angle","magnetic nonlinearities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic motor parameter identification for high speed flux weakening operation of brushless permanent magnet synchronous machines","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6373771","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic motor parameter identification for high speed flux weakening operation of brushless permanent magnet synchronous machines","sourcePdf":"00790901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02522S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"26","articleId":"790901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":790908,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The flux linkage-based state-space model is iteratively coupled to a 2D time-stepping finite element model. The iterative nature of the coupling between these two models facilitates rigorous modeling of the comprehensive impact of inherent space harmonics due to geometries and motor magnetics and time harmonics resulting from the electronic switching of inverters, as well as effects of the synergistic interaction between these time and space harmonics. The state-space model includes no frame of reference transformation in so far as the flux linkages, currents or voltages. This implies that the state-space model directly couples the motor to its power electronic controller in one formulation and the natural variables (voltages and currents) are directly involved in the formulation and computation. Finally, results of motor drive performance simulations and corresponding test results for a six-switch inverter with 180/spl deg/ e duty cycle for each switch and a six-switch inverter with pulse-width modulation are given with excellent test result correlations, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/60.790908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17195/00790908.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"525","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790908.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.790908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of inverter-fed induction motor drives with pulse-width modulation by a time-stepping coupled finite element-flux linkage-based state space model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790908/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of inverter-fed induction motor drives with pulse-width modulation by a time-stepping coupled finite element-flux linkage-based state space model","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6373776","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of inverter-fed induction motor drives with pulse-width modulation by a time-stepping coupled finite element-flux linkage-based state space model","sourcePdf":"00790908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069046S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"22","articleId":"790908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790916,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Two strategies are discussed for torque ripple minimization. The first is based on numerical predetermination of the current waveform which is imposed by the control in machine phases to obtain a constant torque. The second is a torque regulation based on its on-line instantaneous estimation. To optimize the current waveform and minimize copper losses, two methods for current modulus minimization are compared. One is relative to the optimal current which leads to a perfect constant instantaneous torque with minimum instantaneous current modulus, and the second concerns only the mean current modulus. Relation between current components and torque reference can be expressed by functions after normalization. These functions optimizing the mean torque are easy to implement and can be used for torque ripple minimization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.790924","doi":"10.1109/60.790924","startPage":"616","endPage":"621","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17195/00790924.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790924/","displayDocTitle":"Torque ripple minimization in permanent magnet synchronous servodrive","volume":"14","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6379710","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque ripple minimization in permanent magnet synchronous servodrive","sourcePdf":"00790924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034489S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"32","articleId":"790924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":790930,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The inference mechanism of the fuzzy logic controller is represented by a (7/spl times/7) decision table, i.e. 49 if-then rules. There is no need for a plant model to design the FPSS. Two scaling parameters have been introduced to tune the FPSS. These scaling parameters are the outputs of a neural network which gets the operating conditions of the power system as inputs. This mechanism of tuning the FPSS by the neural network, makes the FPSS adaptive to changes in the operating conditions. Therefore, the degradation of the system response, under a wide range of operating conditions, is less compared to the system response with a fixed-parameter FPSS. The tuned stabilizer has been tested by performing nonlinear simulations using a synchronous machine-infinite bus model. The responses are compared with the fixed-parameter FPSS and a conventional (linear) power system stabilizer. It is shown that the neuro-fuzzy stabilizer is superior to both of them.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790950/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6379736","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A rule-based fuzzy power system stabilizer tuned by a neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rule-based fuzzy power system stabilizer tuned by a neural network","sourcePdf":"00790950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045489S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"17","articleId":"790950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790951,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Yi Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Yi Hong","id":"37087178304"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Ching Wu","id":"37087265304"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"790951","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Power system stability","Power system dynamics","Tuning","Power system interconnection","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Control theory","Constraint theory","Equations","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","optimisation","polynomials","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","nonlinear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","parameters tuning","power system stabilizers","small-signal stability enhancement","general-purpose nonlinear programming package","dominant eigenvalue","eigensensitivities","control theory","root-coefficient relationship","polynomial equations","equality constraints","PSS parameters bound","small-signal stability problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790951","abstract":"This paper presents a new method based on the optimization method for tuning the parameters of the power system stabilizers (PSS) to enhance small-signal stability.

However, if the real and reactive powers of the load and PV system are closely matched, islanding detection by passive methods becomes difficult. Also, most active methods lose effectiveness when there are several PV systems feeding the same island. The active frequency drift method (AFD), also called the frequency bias method, enables islanding detection by forcing the frequency of the voltage in the island to drift up or down. In this paper, AFD is studied analytically, using the describing function analysis technique, and by simulation, using MATLAB. It is shown that AFD has a nondetection zone (NDZ) in which it fails to detect islanding, and that this NDZ includes a range of unity-power-factor loads.

An algorithm combining multi-pass dynamic programming (MPDP) with a time-shift technique has been developed for two purposes: economic dispatch of BES; and finding optimal BES power and energy capacities in a power system. Due to the daily cyclic nature of the load curve, a 168-hour load curve is decomposed into seven 24-hour subsections for easy management. Each subsection is treated independently. Decomposition can save computation time and computer memory. A time-shift technique provides better starting state values and improves the finding process of the MPDP approach. The Kansas City Power and Light system is used as an example to test this algorithm. The results obtained in this research have been compared with those from EPRI's DYNASTORE with reasonable discrepancy.","doi":"10.1109/60.790960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.790960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17195/00790960.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"829","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790960.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790960/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Economic dispatch and optimal sizing of battery energy storage systems in utility load-leveling operations","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6379743","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic dispatch and optimal sizing of battery energy storage systems in utility load-leveling operations","sourcePdf":"00790960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03008S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"84","articleId":"790960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790962,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

Starting from the baseline one-pass algorithm using a linear organization of the pronunciation lexicon, they have extended the baseline algorithm toward various dimensions. To handle a large vocabulary, they have shown how the search space can be structured in combination with a lexical prefix tree organization of the pronunciation lexicon. In addition, they have shown how this structure of the search space can be combined with a time-synchronous beam search concept and how the search space can be constructed dynamically during the recognition process. In particular, to increase the efficiency of the beam search concept, they have integrated the language model look-ahead into the pruning operation. To produce sentence alternatives rather than only the single best sentence, they have extended the search strategy to generate a word graph. Finally, they have reported experimental results on a 64 k-word task that demonstrate the efficiency of the various search concepts presented.","doi":"10.1109/79.790984","startPage":"64","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/17194/00790984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.790984","endPage":"83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic programming search for continuous speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic programming search for continuous speech recognition","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6380435","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic programming search for continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"790984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067131S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"60","articleId":"790984","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":790985,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The article introduces the search problem, discusses in detail a typical implementation of a search engine, and demonstrates the efficacy of this approach on a range of problems. The approach presented is scalable across a wide range of applications. It is designed to address research needs, where a premium is placed on the flexibility of the system architecture, and the needs of application prototypes, which require near-real-time speed without a great sacrifice in word error rate (WER). One major area of focus for researchers is the development of real-time systems. With only minor degradations in performance (typically, no more than a 25% increase in WER), the systems described in this article can be transformed into systems that operate at 10/spl times/RT or less. There are four active areas of research related to this problem. First, more intelligent pruning algorithms that prune the search space more heavily are required. Look-ahead and N-best strategies at all levels of the system are key to achieving such large reductions in the search space. Second, multi-pass systems that perform a quick search using a simple system, and then rescore only the N-best resulting hypotheses using better models are very popular for real-time implementation. Third, since much of the computation in these systems is devoted to acoustic model processing, fast-matching strategies within the acoustic model are important. Finally, since Gaussian evaluation at each state in the system is a major consumer of CPU time, vector quantization-like approaches that enable one to compute only a small number of Gaussians per frame are proven to be successful. In some sense, the Viterbi (1967) based system presented represents only one path through this continuum of recognition search strategies.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/17194/00790985.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical search for large-vocabulary conversational speech recognition: working toward a solution to the decoding problem","doi":"10.1109/79.790985","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00790985.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.790985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=790985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/790985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical search for large-vocabulary conversational speech recognition: working toward a solution to the decoding problem","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6380436","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical search for large-vocabulary conversational speech recognition: working toward a solution to the decoding problem","sourcePdf":"00790985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052463S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"18","articleId":"790985","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":791044,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

These capabilities are key to many new emerging robotic applications in service, construction, field, underwater, and space. An important characteristic of these robots is the \"assistance\" ability they can bring to humans in performing various physical tasks. To interact with humans and operate in their environments, these robots must be provided with the functionality of mobility and manipulation. The article presents developments of models, strategies, and algorithms concerned with a number of autonomous capabilities that are essential for robot operations in human environments. These capabilities include: integrated mobility and manipulation, cooperative skills between multiple robots, interaction ability with humans, and efficient techniques for real-time modification of collision-free path. These capabilities are demonstrated on two holonomic mobile platforms designed and built at Stanford University in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratories and Nomadic Technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ROMOCO.1999.791078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17138","startPage":"213","endPage":"221","pdfPath":"/iel5/6415/17138/00791078.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Robot Motion and Control.

The initial positioning has the purpose of locating the end effector of the robot arm in the first point of the trajectory, and the incremental positioning of moving the end effector to the next point of the trajectory.

We also use Bayesian methods to differentiate the class of unknown objects by evaluating detected actions along with low-level, extracted object features.

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes.

However most work on tracking and synthesizing figure motion has employed either simple, generic dynamic models or highly specific hand-tailored ones. Recently, a broad class of learning and inference algorithms for time-series models have been successfully cast in the framework of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). This paper describes a novel DBN-based switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) model and presents its application to figure motion analysis. A key feature of our approach is an approximate Viterbi inference technique for overcoming the intractability of exact inference in mixed-state DBNs. We present experimental results for learning figure dynamics from video data and show promising initial results for tracking, interpolation, synthesis, and classification using learned models.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.791203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.791203","startPage":"94","endPage":"101 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17134/00791203.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic Bayesian network approach to figure tracking using learned dynamic models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic Bayesian network approach to figure tracking using learned dynamic models","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6371187","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791203/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic Bayesian network approach to figure tracking using learned dynamic models","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00791203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065914S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"129","articleId":"791203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":791206,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Unlike in spoken languages, phonemes can occur simultaneously in ASL. The number of possible combinations of phonemes after enforcing linguistic constraints is approximately 5.5/spl times/10/sup 8/. Gesture recognition, which is less constrained than ASL recognition, suffers from the same problem. Thus, it is not feasible to train conventional hidden Markov models (HMMs) for large-scab ASL applications. Factorial HMMs and coupled HMMs are two extensions to HMMs that explicitly attempt to model several processes occuring in parallel. Unfortunately, they still require consideration of the combinations at training time. In this paper we present a novel approach to ASL recognition that aspires to being a solution to the scalability problems. It is based on parallel HMMs (PaHMMs), which model the parallel processes independently. Thus, they can also be trained independently, and do not require consideration of the different combinations at training time. We develop the recognition algorithm for PaHMMs and show that it runs in time polynomial in the number of states, and in time linear in the number of parallel processes. We run several experiments with a 22 sign vocabulary and demonstrate that PaHMMs can improve the robustness of HMM-based recognition even on a small scale. Thus, PaHMMs are a very promising general recognition scheme with applications in both gesture and ASL recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.791206","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17134/00791206.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"122 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.791206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel hidden Markov models for American sign language recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791206/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel hidden Markov models for American sign language recognition","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6371190","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel hidden Markov models for American sign language recognition","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00791206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046998S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"123","articleId":"791206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":791208,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When compared with other sources of variation in face images (e.g. variation due to changes in pose and expression), appearance variation due to ageing displays some unique characteristics. For example ageing variation is specific to a given individual, it occurs slowly and it is affected significantly by other factors, such as the health, gender and the lifestyle of the individual. In this paper we describe how the effects of ageing on facial appearance can be explained using a parameterized statistical model. We present experimental results to show that reasonably accurate estimates of age can be made for unseen images. We also show that we can improve our results significantly by taking into account the fact that different individuals age in different ways and by considering the effect of lifestyle. We also demonstrate how the proposed framework can be used for simulating ageing effects on new face images, in order to predict how an individual might look like in the future, or how he/she used to look in the past.

These shapes keep the resolution in the image invariant to changes in elevation in the scene. In other words, this family of shapes achieves solid angle pixel density invariance. An analysis of range finding using two coaxial axially symmetric resolution invariant mirrors in a coaxial pair is presented. The resolution invariance property of these mirrors mean that when the image captured is unwarped the resultant image will not suffer from variable image quality. This problem is present in unwarped images captured with any mirror shape not designed for resolution invariance. The resolution invariance of these mirrors is especially important in the case of stereo panoramic mirrors where one view of the scene is captured within the other and thus will have lower resolution. It is necessary to clearly identify two was of an object to undertake range-finding. The proposed mirror shapes will be useful for mobile robotics and machine vision. Other applications areas such as visual sensing for control of traffic lights at street intersections could be considered.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.791247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17134/00791247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.791247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17134","startPage":"392","endPage":"397 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resolution invariant surfaces for panoramic vision systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resolution invariant surfaces for panoramic vision systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791247/","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6371213","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resolution invariant surfaces for panoramic vision systems","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00791247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047857S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"40","articleId":"791247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":791257,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

The neurocalibration technique is shown to solve four different types of calibration problems that are found in computer vision applications. Moreover, it can be extended to the more difficult problem of calibrating cameras with automated active lenses. The validity and performance of our technique are tested with both synthetic data under different noise conditions and with real images.

The energy is minimized in a greedy strategy that alternates between segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping regions (using the multiway-cut algorithm of Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih) and finding the affine parameters describing the displacement function of each region. A follow-up step enables the algorithm to escape local minima due to oversegmentation.

This method uses a feature with the most useful similarities for grouping, selected using motion information calculated by factorization method and discriminant criterion. A group is extracted based on discriminant analysis for the selected feature's similarities. The same procedure is applied recursively to the remaining features to extract other groups. This grouping is robust against noise and outliers because features with no useful information are automatically rejected. Numerical computation is simple and stable. No prior knowledge is needed on the number of objects.

It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment, such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible.

This is obtained by employing a geodesic active region model where the designed objective function is composed of boundary and region-based terms and optimizes the curve position with respect to motion and intensity properties. The main novelty of our approach is that we deal with the motion estimation (linear models are assumed) and the tracking problem simultaneously. In other words, the optimization problem contains a coupled set of unknown variables; the curve position and the corresponding motion model. The designed objective function is minimized using a gradient descent method; the curve is propagated towards the object boundaries under the influence of boundary, intensity and motion-based forces using a PDE, while given the curve position an incremental analytical solution is obtained for the motion model. Besides, this PDE is implemented using a level set approach where topological changes are naturally handled. Very promising experimental results are provided using real video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1999.791292","startPage":"688","endPage":"694 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1999.791292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17134","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/6412/17134/00791292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geodesic active regions for motion estimation and tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791292/","displayDocTitle":"Geodesic active regions for motion estimation and tracking","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6365275","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-27 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geodesic active regions for motion estimation and tracking","confLoc":"Kerkyra, Greece","sourcePdf":"00791292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041715S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6412","citationCount":"75","articleId":"791292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":791294,"authors":[{"name":"Byung Jin Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Byung Jin Cho","id":"37274892100"},{"name":"Sun Jung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Sun Jung Kim","id":"37421925600"},{"name":"C.H.

A large increase in leakage current was observed on the irradiated oxides. The current-voltage characteristics of this radiation-induced leakage current (RILC) were found to be very similar to the electrical stress-induced leakage currents (SILC). Both currents comprise a DC component due to trap-assisted tunneling, and a transient component attributed to the tunnel charge/discharging of carriers. A further component, related to the redistribution and trapping of generated holes in the oxide bulk, is observed in the RILC, but only for thicker oxides. Therefore, the RILC and the SILC have the same degradation mechanism in ultra-thin oxides of around 45 /spl Aring/ or less. An experimental relationship between the total X-ray dose and the equivalent charge fluence that induces the same amount of degradation, has been established. The oxide thickness dependence of the relationship was also obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6512176","conferenceDate":"9-9 July 1999","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-induced leakage current of ultra-thin gate oxide under X-ray lithography conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-induced leakage current of ultra-thin gate oxide under X-ray lithography conditions","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00791294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042095S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6431","citationCount":"4","articleId":"791294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":791351,"authors":[{"name":"Chaplin","affiliation":["Massey University, New Zealand"],"lastName":"Chaplin"},{"name":"Hodgson","affiliation":["Massey University, New Zealand"],"lastName":"Hodgson"},{"name":"Gunetileke","affiliation":["Massey University, New Zealand"],"lastName":"Gunetileke"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-85296-717-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0537-9989"}],"articleNumber":"791351","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["problem knowledge","neural networks training","image processing tasks","machine vision system","long-term project","software systems development","human performance emulation","learning by example","neural network based window filter","Adobe Plugin Protocol functions","image processing packages","network weights initialisation","supervised neural network training","high dimensional optimisation problem","initial conditions","search","convergence speed","backpropagation","fuzzy neural network architecture","trained network","Boolean rules","IF THEN rules"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791351","abstract":"If a human can perform an image processing task then, given sufficient time and determination an expert can often develop a machine vision system to emulate this performance. The work reported here is part of a long-term project that is aimed at the development of software systems that can learn by example and emulate human performance. The non-algorithmic approach of using a neural network based window filter (NNWF) has been used. General access is provided to the results of this research via Adobe Plugin Protocol functions available for use in image processing packages. This paper reports the use of task specific knowledge to initialise the network weights prior to training. Supervised neural network training is a high dimensional optimisation problem and the initial conditions of the search are critical to the quality of the solutions found (local or global optima) and the speed of convergence to the solution. These initial conditions should be problem specific but standard training methods, backpropagation, Levin-Marquadt etc. start with the initial weights set to small, random numbers. The weight set of a trained network embodies knowledge of the task; it is in some sense a description of the task. The initial weight set is, by this reasoning, a partial description of the task and could be derived from the available problem knowledge. It is often possible to partially describe an image processing task as a set of rules. These rules may be fuzzy in nature, incomplete and ambiguous but still provide a useful guide for a human attempting the task. A mapping scheme has been developed that can be used to map simple Boolean rules to a fuzzy neural network whose architecture reflects the structure of IF THEN rules. The fuzzy neural network (FuNN) architecture is described.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19990282","pdfPath":"/iel5/6426/17151/00791351.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"66 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Image Processing And Its Applications, 1999.

As a consequence, the market is flooded with new, increasingly technical software and hardware products. This paper presents an analytical overview of the most popular ANNs, both in hardware and software modes. After an overview of ANN, the paper discusses global optimization for ANN training, and the NOVEL hybrid method is presented and its performance is discussed. The paper then discusses the techniques and means for parallelizing neurosimulations of ANNs, both at a high programming level and at a low hardware-emulation level. It then presents vector microprocessor architectures and the Spert II fixed-point system as applied to multimedia and human-machine interface. Finally, it introduces the most recently explored concept of cellular neural networks (CNN), its performance and operation are analyzed. Conclusions and recommendations conclude the paper.","doi":"10.1109/IPMM.1999.791476","startPage":"713","endPage":"721 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Processing and Manufacturing of Materials.

To reduce the amount of small variations in color, a clustering algorithm is applied in a preprocessing step. Two methods have been developed for extracting text hypotheses. One is based on a top-down analysis using successive splitting of image regions. The other is a bottom-up region growing algorithm. The results of both methods are combined to robustly distinguish between text and non-text elements. Text elements are binarized using automatically extracted information about text color. The binarized text regions can be used as input for a conventional OCR module. Results are shown for parts of book and journal covers of different complexity. The proposed method is not restricted to cover pages, but can be applied to the extraction of text from other types of color images as well.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1999.791724","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition.

The conventional methods are based on a process with two sequential stages, viz. the segmentation of touching numerals and the recognition of the individual numerals. Due to an unlimited number of different overlapping and touching types, the segmentation-based approach has always had a limited success rate. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation-free method using a neural network. In this approach, two touching numerals are regarded as a single pattern from a pattern source with 100 classes. To obtain a training set for the neural network classifier, we synthesize the patterns by moving two isolated numerals in the NIST database horizontally until they touch. For the test set, we manually extract two touching numerals from the numeric string dataset of the NlST database. By using a modular neural network classifier, promising results have been obtained.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1999.791772","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition.

Gujarati belongs to the genre of Devanagri scripts from the Indian subcontinent. Very little work is found in the literature for recognition of Indian language scripts. For this paper a subset of similar appearing Gujarati characters was chosen and subjected to classification by different classifiers. The sample and test images for the characters were obtained from digital images available on the Internet and from scanned images of printed Gujarati text. For their classification, the Euclidean Minimum Distance and the k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers were used with regular and invariant moments. The characters were also classified in the binary feature space using Hamming Distance classifier. The paper presents the recognition rates for these classifiers. A recognition rate of 67% is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sep 1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-22 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6352854","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Gujarati character recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gujarati character recognition","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"00791813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080782S","chronDate":"20-22 Sep 1999","isNumber":"17144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6420","citationCount":"37","articleId":"791813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":791860,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We have proposed a novel Gabor filter-based feature extraction scheme for the connected components. We have also found that frequency distribution of the width-to-height ratio of the connected components can also be used for script recognition.

To reach a balance of speed and accuracy, a filter distinguishing a connected image from an isolated image is required for multi-stage segmentation. The Fourier spectrum is promising in this problem. Since it is influenced by the stroke width, we propose a Fourier spectrum standardization method. Based on the standardized Fourier spectrum, a set of features and a fine-tuned criterion are presented to classify connected/isolated images. A theoretical analysis proves their rationality. Experimental results demonstrate that this criterion is better than other methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new distinguishing algorithm of connected character image based on Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition.

Applying mature semiconductor methodologies to the design of RSFQ circuits, one encounters substantial difficulties originating from the differences between both technologies. In this paper, a new design methodology aimed at large-scale RSFQ circuits is proposed. This methodology is based on a semiconductor semicustom design approach. An established design methodology for small-stale RSFQ digital circuits, based on circuit (junction-level) simulation and device parameter optimization, is used for the design of basic RSFQ cells. A library composed of about 20 basic RSFQ cells has been developed based on this approach. A novel design methodology for large-scale circuits, presented in this paper, is based on logic (gate-level) simulation and timing optimization. This methodology has been implemented around the Cadence integrated design environment and used successfully at the University of Rochester for the design of two large-scale digital circuits.","doi":"10.1109/77.791915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/17203/00791915.pdf","startPage":"4591","endPage":"4606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.791915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a systematic design methodology for large multigigahertz rapid single flux quantum circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Toward a systematic design methodology for large multigigahertz rapid single flux quantum circuits","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6388523","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a systematic design methodology for large multigigahertz rapid single flux quantum circuits","sourcePdf":"00791915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070698S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"12","articleId":"791915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":791917,"authors":[{"name":"Minseok Joo","affiliation":["Engineering Research Institute, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Minseok Joo","id":"37087267333"},{"name":"Tae Kuk Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Kuk Ko","id":"37087067385"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"791917","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current limiters","Superconducting coils","Damping","Magnetic cores","Magnetic flux","Fault current limiters","Inductors","Copper","Saturation magnetization","Superconducting magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-temperature superconductors","fault current limiters","superconducting devices","damping","coils","magnetic cores","electric impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current limiting performance","current limiting devices","damping coils","HTSC fault current limiter","reactor","model","SFCL","primary copper coil","secondary HTSC rings","magnetic coupling","three-legged magnetic core","magnetic flux cancellation","saturation point","saturated state","magnetic core saturation","air-gap length","central leg","effective impedance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791917","doi":"10.1109/77.791917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.791917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/17203/00791917.pdf","startPage":"4613","endPage":"4618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement on current limiting performance of current limiting devices with damping coils","abstract":"An improved model of the current limiting devices such as the high-Tc superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and the reactor have been developed. The high-Tc SFCL mainly consists of the primary copper coil, the secondary high-Tc superconducting rings, and the damping coils, which are magnetically coupled through a three-legged magnetic core. Because a portion of the magnetic flux above the saturation point generated by the fault current is cancelled by the damping coil, thereby the magnetic core is prevented from getting into the saturated state. The limiting current level and the saturation of the core could be controlled by the air-gap length of the central leg with the damping coil.

The new elements are triangular or tetrahedral edge elements (tangential vector elements) of arbitrary polynomial order. They are hierarchal, so that different orders can be used together in the same mesh and p-adaption is possible. They provide separate representation of the gradient and rotational parts of the vector field. Explicit formulas are presented for generating the basis functions to arbitrary order. The basis functions can be used directly or after a further stage of partial orthogonalization to improve the matrix conditioning. Matrix assembly for the frequency-domain curl-curl equation is conveniently carried out by means of universal matrices. Application of the new elements to the solution of a parallel-plate waveguide problem demonstrates the expected convergence rate of the phase of the reflection coefficient, for tetrahedral elements to order 4. In particular, the full-order elements have only the same asymptotic convergence rate as elements with a reduced gradient space (such as the Whitney element). However, further tests reveal that the optimum balance of the gradient and rotational components is problem-dependent.","doi":"10.1109/8.791939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17206/00791939.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.791939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchal vector basis functions of arbitrary order for triangular and tetrahedral finite elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791939/","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchal vector basis functions of arbitrary order for triangular and tetrahedral finite elements","volume":"47","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6386067","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchal vector basis functions of arbitrary order for triangular and tetrahedral finite elements","sourcePdf":"00791939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05493S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"329","articleId":"791939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":791942,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is developed for quasi three-dimensional (3-D) environments and can be applied to any complex propagation environment composed of arbitrary-shaped buildings and streets. It finds all propagation paths from a transmitter to a receiver extensively with very high computation efficiency. It is fundamentally a point-to-point tracing method, so reception tests are not required and it guarantees high accuracy. To validate our ray-tracing method, signal path loss and root mean square (rms) delay spread were computed in the downtown core of Ottawa, Canada, and they were also compared with the published measurements. The results of the proposed method in this paper show good agreement with the measurements. The computation time required to obtain a path loss map in the site is revealed to be very short in comparison with other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17206/00791954.pdf","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.791954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.791954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deterministic ray tube method for microcellular wave propagation prediction model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Ray tracing","Testing","Electromagnetic propagation","Solid modeling","Physical theory of diffraction","Electromagnetic scattering","Radio transmitters","Electromagnetic measurements","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometrical theory of diffraction","ray tracing","radiowave propagation","microcellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic ray tube method","microcellular wave propagation prediction model","ray-tracing method","ray tube tree","uniform geometrical theory of diffraction","UTD","quasi three-dimensional environments","complex propagation environment","arbitrary-shaped buildings","streets","propagation paths","computation efficiency","point-to-point tracing method","signal path loss","root mean square delay spread","downtown","Ottawa","Canada","computation time","path loss map"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"A deterministic ray tube method for microcellular wave propagation prediction model","volume":"47","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6386082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deterministic ray tube method for microcellular wave propagation prediction model","sourcePdf":"00791954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033285S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"87","articleId":"791954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":791962,"authors":[{"name":"Seop Hyeong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hallym University, Kangwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seop Hyeong Park","id":"37087248343"},{"name":"Dong Sik Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Dong Sik Kim","id":"37087248012"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"791962","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":238},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Constraint theory","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","ISO standards","Transform coding","Image restoration","Iterative algorithms","Image converters","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","iterative methods","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrow quantization constraint set","postprocessing","coded images","a priori information","QCS","iterative algorithms","projections onto convex sets","converged image","boundary point","narrow QCS","constrained minimization problem","probability theory","coded image"]}],"abstract":"Since the postprocessing of coded images using a priori information depends on the constraints imposed on the coded images, it is important to utilize constraints that are best suited to postprocessing techniques. Among the constraint sets, the quantization constraint set (QCS) is commonly used in the iterative algorithms that are especially based on the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS). The converged image in the iteration is usually a boundary point of the QCS. But, we can easily conjecture that the possible location of the original image is inside the QCS. In order to obtain an image inside the QCS, we proposed a new convex constraint set, a subset of the QCS called narrow QCS (NQCS) as a substitute for the QCS. In order to demonstrate that the NQCS works better than the QCS on natural images, we present mathematical analysis with examples and simulations by reformulating the iterative algorithm of the constrained minimization problem or of the POCS using the probability theory. Since the initial image of the iteration is the centroid of the QCS, we reach a conclusion that the first iteration is enough to recover the coded image, which implies no need of any theories that guarantee the convergences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of projection onto the narrow quantization constraint set and its application","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.791962","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17202/00791962.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.791962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=791962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/791962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Theory of projection onto the narrow quantization constraint set and its application","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6388564","pubMedId":"18267408","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of projection onto the narrow quantization constraint set and its application","sourcePdf":"00791962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096654S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"59","articleId":"791962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":791966,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The missile should be detected and its state estimated within a short window of time because the flight time is short. In this paper the acquisition of an incoming missile using the measurements from a surface based electronically scanned array (ESA) radar is presented. We present a batch maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to acquire the missile while it is exo-atmospheric. The estimator, which combines MLE with the probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm to handle false alarms/clutter, also uses the amplitude information (signal strength). This facilitates target acquisition under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The Cramer-Rao lower bound quantifying attainable estimate accuracies is also presented and shown to be achieved by the proposed estimator. It is also shown that the optimum detection threshold can be found by maximizing the information reduction factor that accounts for the loss of information.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.1999.792103","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Event services are used to glue together distributed components. They assume a virtual global time base to trigger actions and to order events. The notion of a global time that is provided by synchronized local clocks in distributed systems has a fundamental impact on the semantics of event-driven systems, especially the composition of events. The well studied 2g-precedence model, which assumes that the granularity of global time-base g can be derived from a priori known and bounded precision of local clocks may not be suitable for the Internet where the accuracy and external synchronization of local clocks is best effort and cannot be guaranteed because of large transmission delay variations and phases of disconnection. We introduce a mechanism based on NTP synchronized local clocks with global reference time injected by GPS time servers. We agree that timestamps of events can be related to global reference time with bounded accuracy and propose that event timestamps are modeled using accuracy intervals. We present algorithms for event composition and event consumption which make use of accuracy interval based timestamping and illustrate the problems that arise due to inaccuracy and message transmission delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/792159/","accessionNumber":"6359161","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Event composition in time-dependent distributed systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event composition in time-dependent distributed systems","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"00792159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067091S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6435","citationCount":"43","articleId":"792159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":792176,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

The miniaturized device, designed to imitate a nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM), has a latency more than one hundred times smaller than that of a NOLM. Also, because it used an MMIWA for replacing a coupler in a conventional NOLM, its operation was quite different from that previously reported. In CW signal operation, the nonlinear switching behaviour resulted from the combined effect of nonlinear coupling in the MMIWA and the amplification and lateral field redistribution of the signal through the loop structure. Efficient self-switching and cross-polarized switching were observed.

An improved rate of fault detection during regression testing can provide faster feedback on a system under regression test and let debuggers begin their work earlier than might otherwise be possible.

NTRS and model calculations converge at the 70 nm technology generation, which exhibits pronounced on/off current interdependence for low power gigascale integration.","doi":"10.1109/4.792617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17209/00792617.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.792617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A physical alpha-power law MOSFET model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=792617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A physical alpha-power law MOSFET model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/792617/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6386062","volume":"34","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A physical alpha-power law MOSFET model","sourcePdf":"00792617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039682S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"84","articleId":"792617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":792618,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Yih Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyh-Yih Ma","id":"37280187800"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"792618","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":401},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=792618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Cameras","Circuits","Low voltage","CMOS process","Sensor arrays","Image storage","Power supplies","Pixel","Motion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","integrated circuit noise","interference suppression","low-power electronics","analogue-digital conversion","digital readout","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-chip CMOS APS camera","direct frame difference output","active pixel sensor","in-pixel storage","previous frame image data","low supply voltage operation","onchip ADC","analog-to-digital converter","double-poly double-metal CMOS process","motion detection","video compression","3.3 V","0.5 micron","56 mW","8 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.792618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17209/00792618.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.792618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17209","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00792618.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-chip CMOS APS camera with direct frame difference output","abstract":"A complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor (APS) camera chip with direct frame difference output is reported in this paper.

We evaluate the accuracy of our expressions, as well as several previously published inductance expressions, in two ways: by comparison with three-dimensional field solver predictions and by comparison with our own measurements, and also previously published measurements. Our simple expression matches the field solver inductance values typically within around 3%, about an order of magnitude better than the previously published expressions, which have typical errors ground 20% (or more). Comparison with measured values gives similar results: our expressions (and, indeed, the field solver results) match within around 5%, compared to errors of around 20% for the previously published expressions. (We believe most of the additional errors in the comparison to published measured values is due to the variety of experimental conditions under which the inductance was measured.) Our simple expressions are accurate enough for design and optimization of inductors or of circuits incorporating inductors. Indeed, since inductor tolerance is typically on the order of several percent, \"more accurate\" expressions are not really needed in practice.","doi":"10.1109/4.792620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17209/00792620.pdf","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.792620","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00792620.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple accurate expressions for planar spiral inductances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=792620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Simple accurate expressions for planar spiral inductances","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/792620/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6386064","volume":"34","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple accurate expressions for planar spiral inductances","sourcePdf":"00792620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052755S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"949","articleId":"792620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":792664,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The method is based on the 2D finite element method coupling with external circuit models, together with the simultaneous simulation of the motion of the rotor system. Attention is focused on the special issues, such as the best approach to take into account the motion between the stator and the rotor, the skin effect and the numerical oscillation which arises from the (high frequency) step changes of the output voltages of the inverter, when finite element analysis is used. In this paper the interpolating moving boundary is introduced when considering the relative motion between the stator and the rotor, and the numerical critical damping method is used to suppress the numerical oscillation which may occur in numerical simulations. The computed results of a PWM inverter-fed motor drive system is used to validate the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.1999.792664","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1999 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems.

Reduction in the size of power supplies can be achieved by a topology change from linear transformer type to switching mode. To reduce the size further, the switching frequency has to be increased. However, there are a number of limitations and problems associated with the increase of switching frequency. The active-clamp discontinuous mode flyback converter (ADCMFC) introduced in this paper is one of the solutions to increase the switching frequency. Besides, the paper also introduces an optimization method to obtain the transfer function of the ADCMFC under different operating conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.1999.792795","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1999 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems.

The NN is employed to classify the system input-output measurements into several patterns depending on the displacement and velocity deviations from the respective desired trajectories. A proportional plus derivative gain control action is determined from a look-up table corresponding to the classification from the NN.

Existing wind power generating systems are mostly of large capacity (over 100 kW) and high-priced (about 1000 USS/kW). Because of the erratic changes of wind power and of smoothing peak power, an AC/DC converter-fed battery system is recommended. Thus, one requires the exact rotating speed of generators (especially in the case of synchronous generators) to use AC/DC converters with high quality. These factors are increasing the cost of such systems. The authors adopt a compact permanent magnet type synchronous generator, which doesn't need exciting current, and a step-up/down buck-boost chopper to wind power generating system of a few kW output without position or speed sensor. In addition, they employ an inexpensive rectifier circuit using a diode bridge instead of an AC/DC power converter with PWM method. Using these methods, they achieve a simple and inexpensive wind power generating system.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.1999.792817","startPage":"849","endPage":"854 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1999 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems.

Two simulation models are built to obtain example patterns for training the neural network. One is a multiple-feedback-loop controller for linear loads, and the other is an idealized load-current-feedback controller specially designed for nonlinear loads. The latter controller has a built-in reference load model, and the load current is forced to track this reference. Example patterns under various loading conditions are used in the off-line training of a selected neural network which is made as simple as possible to reduce the calculation time. When the training is completed, the neural network is used to control the UPS inverter on-line. The development of example patterns and training of the neural network are done using MATLAB and SIMULINK, and the verification of results is done using PSpice. It is found that the proposed neural-network-controlled inverter can provide good sinusoidal output voltage with low total harmonic distortion (THD) under various loading conditions, and good transient responses when the load changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/792820/","accessionNumber":"6483070","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-controlled single-phase UPS inverters with improved transient response and adaptability to various loads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-controlled single-phase UPS inverters with improved transient response and adaptability to various loads","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00792820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032296S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6444","citationCount":"1","articleId":"792820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":792861,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Ying","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Ying","id":"37087142135"},{"name":"Guozhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guozhi Li","id":"37087298409"},{"name":"Dehua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Dehua Zhang","id":"37087298658"},{"name":"Zhengshi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhengshi Wang","id":"37087298851"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5769-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"792861","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=792861","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Resonant inverters","Inductors","Clamps","Topology","Switching loss","Voltage control","Zero voltage switching","RLC circuits","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","resonant power convertors","losses","invertors","power inductors","power MOSFET","power semiconductor switches","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actively clamped resonant DC link inverter","two amplitudes scheme","switching losses reduction","simple topology","simulation waveforms","experimental results","output current","resonant inductor losses","clamp device losses"]}],"abstract":"The actively clamped resonant DC link inverter (ACRDCLI) has the advantages of low switching losses and relatively simple topology.

In order to compensate the instantaneous harmonic current components by active power filtering technique, it is a prerequisite to estimate the magnitude and phase of each harmonic component in real time. In this paper, a promethean approach is proposed for the determination of magnitude and phase of each current harmonic component from the distorted line currents. This approach introduces an adaptive learning multi-layer backpropagation neural network which converges faster than simple back-propagation neural network. Unlike conventional methods of harmonic current determination, this method requires only half cycle of the distorted current waves.

These negative impacts range from extreme unfairness against competing TCP traffic to the potential for congestion collapse. To promote the inclusion of end-to-end congestion control in the design of future protocols using best-effort traffic, we argue that router mechanisms are needed to identify and restrict the bandwidth of selected high-bandwidth best-effort flows in times of congestion. The paper discusses several general approaches for identifying those flows suitable for bandwidth regulation. These approaches are to identify a high-bandwidth flow in times of congestion as unresponsive, \"not TCP-friendly\", or simply using disproportionate bandwidth. A flow that is not \"TCP-friendly\" is one whose long-term arrival rate exceeds that of any conformant TCP in the same circumstances. An unresponsive flow is one failing to reduce its offered load at a router in response to an increased packet drop rate, and a disproportionate-bandwidth flow is one that uses considerably more bandwidth than other flows in a time of congestion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Promoting the use of end-to-end congestion control in the Internet","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.793002","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17210/00793002.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.793002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"Promoting the use of end-to-end congestion control in the Internet","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6363229","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Promoting the use of end-to-end congestion control in the Internet","sourcePdf":"00793002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067377S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"959","articleId":"793002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793003,"authors":[{"name":"Songwu Lu","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Songwu Lu","id":"37350772000"},{"name":"V.

Besides, in packet cellular networks, the base station typically performs the task of packet scheduling for both downlink and uplink flows in a cell; however, a base station has only a limited knowledge of the arrival processes of uplink flows. We propose a new model for wireless fair-scheduling based on an adaptation of fluid fair queueing (FFQ) to handle location-dependent error bursts. We describe an ideal wireless fair-scheduling algorithm which provides a packetized implementation of the fluid mode, while assuming full knowledge of the current channel conditions. For this algorithm, we derive the worst-case throughput and delay bounds. Finally, we describe a practical wireless scheduling algorithm which approximates the ideal algorithm. Through simulations, we show that the algorithm achieves the desirable properties identified in the wireless FFQ model.","doi":"10.1109/90.793003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.793003","endPage":"489","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17210/00793003.pdf","startPage":"473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair scheduling in wireless packet networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793003/","displayDocTitle":"Fair scheduling in wireless packet networks","volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6363230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair scheduling in wireless packet networks","sourcePdf":"00793003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029085S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"374","articleId":"793003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793006,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The FCS is equipped with a rule-cache making it possible for the learnt expertise to be applied to future situations and to allow GA learning to start the search from the best point found. The system uses sensory information in-order to narrow the search space for the GA. The proposed techniques have resulted in rapid convergence suitable for learning individual behaviours online without need for simulation. The results of this work are compared with results reported elsewhere and reveal this approach has a superior performance to existing systems.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1999.793024","startPage":"668","endPage":"673 vol.2","publicationTitle":"FUZZ-IEEE'99. 1999 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems.

The TOD signal operates on a preset signal cycling which cycles on the basis of the average number of average passenger cars in the memory device of an electric signal unit. Today, with increasing traffic and congested roads, the conventional traffic light creates startup-delay time and end lag time so that thirty to forty-five percent efficiency in traffic handling is lost, as well as adding to fuel costs. To solve this problem, the paper proposes a concept of the optimal green time algorithm, which reduces average vehicle waiting time while improving average vehicle speed using fuzzy rules and neural networks. Through computer simulation, this method has been proven to be much more efficient than fixed time interval signals. The fuzzy neural network will consistently improve average waiting time, vehicle speed, and fuel consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793044/","accessionNumber":"6430791","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of optimal green time simulation using fuzzy neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of optimal green time simulation using fuzzy neural network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00793044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054379S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","isNumber":"17177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6417","citationCount":"5","articleId":"793044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":793047,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It searches the goal with a small population size and generates fewer number of generations than that of conventional genetic algorithm to reduce user's burden. But this property may derive local minimum and sometimes more poor solution than random search method owing to relatively small size population.

In classifying complex patterns with high similarity like the defect patterns of a cold mill strip, the selection of an optimal feature set and an appropriate recognizer is important to achieve high recognition rate. In this paper the GA (genetic algorithm) and K-means algorithm were used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are classified into two classes using a linear decision function. This process is repeated at each node until all the patterns are classified into individual classes. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree is constructed automatically. After constructing the binary decision tree, the final recognizer is accomplished by having a neural network learning sets of standard patterns at each node. In this paper, the classifier using the binary decision tree was applied to the recognition of defect patterns of a cold mill strip, and the experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1999.793104","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1085 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"FUZZ-IEEE'99. 1999 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems.

The hopper is equipped with a simple microprocessor and wireless modem so that it can receive sequences of commands and autonomously execute them, making it suitable for exploration of distant planets, comets and asteroids.

The central goal of the Reconfigurable Computing Application Development Environment (RCADE) is to capitalize on these improvements. Through RCADE, an algorithm is translated into a data flow design, which is then implemented on a reconfigurable computing platform using a \"toolbox\" of components. This paper expands this library of components by implementing the following IEEE single precision floating-point functions: sine, cosine, arctangent, arcsine, arccosine, square root and natural logarithm. Each component is designed around the CORDIC shift-and-add algorithms. A discussion of how each operation is implemented is followed by an analysis of the space requirements of each component on current and future Xilinx FPGAs. Performance results are compared for each component individually and for two example equations against several current workstations.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.1999.793177","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

However, modeling precisely plasma variables are difficult due to the extremely complex nature of physical dynamics within a plasma. In this paper, an inductively coupled plasma is modeled using neural networks. Variables modeled include typical electron density, electron temperature and plasma potential, whose data were collected with a Langmuir Probe. The plasma was characterized by a 2/sup 4/ full factorial experimental design with three center point replications. Factors varied in the design are a source power, pressure, chuck holder position, and Cl/sub 2/ flow rate. To test model suitability, experiments corresponding to face-centered arrays were additionally required. Resulting 27 experimental trials were conducted on an inductively-coupled plasma etch system. The R/sup 2/ of model fit are 0.981, 0.874, and 0.932 for electron density, temperature and plasma potential, respectively. Corresponding RMS predictive-errors are 0.716, 0.484 and 1.075, respectively. Neural network was found to accurately model plasma density and potential. Much lessened accuracy in temperature model can be ascribed to its training data least scattered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793252/","accessionNumber":"6422436","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A neural network plasma model of semiconductor manufacturing equipment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network plasma model of semiconductor manufacturing equipment","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00793252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027228S","chronDate":"22-25 Aug. 1999","isNumber":"17219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6417","citationCount":"2","articleId":"793252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":793255,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Asymmetric system design addresses this problem by exploiting the major differences in the availability of resources (i.e., energy, space) that exist between base stations and portable units. Such an approach seeks to concentrate most of the signal processing tasks involved in the operation of the two-way wireless link at the base station. This paper presents and discusses the implications of a set of techniques for asymmetric physical layer system design based on the use of channel precoding for forward transmission. System performance is assessed via simulations using a realistic time-varying channel model. Simplified two-way antenna diversity implemented exclusively at the base station and the key issue of automatic gain control at the receive side of the precoded link are also addressed and evaluated. Simulation results confirm that the adoption of these techniques enables reliable digital communication at a data rate of 20 Mbit/s on both links while significantly reducing the power consumption of the portable unit.","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17215/00793307.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.793307","doi":"10.1109/49.793307","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793307","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Base stations","Wireless communication","Data communication","Availability","Space stations","Signal processing","System performance","Time-varying channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","indoor radio","land mobile radio","data communication","radio links","channel coding","time-varying channels","diversity reception","automatic gain control","wireless LAN","intersymbol interference","interference suppression","equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric physical layer design","high-speed wireless digital communications","high data rates","portability","indoor wireless data communication systems","asymmetric system design","base stations","portable units","signal processing","two-way wireless link","channel precoding","forward transmission","system performance","time-varying channel model","two-way antenna diversity","automatic gain control","simulation results","reliable digital communication","power consumption reduction","wireless local area networks","wireless LAN","ISI cancellation","channel equalization","20 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric physical layer design for high-speed wireless digital communications","accessionNumber":"6384498","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric physical layer design for high-speed wireless digital communications","sourcePdf":"00793307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064982S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"13","articleId":"793307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":793308,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The joint antennas and DFE scheme, with one forward filter for each antenna and a single feedback filter (FBF), can be viewed as a spatial and temporal DFE (ST-DFE). The performance of this solution is compared with the cascade of adaptive antenna used for beamforming and DFE. It is found that ST-DFE achieves better performance since it combines the beamforming capability of the antenna array with the equalization properties of the DFE, with great advantages especially when rays arrive from similar angles. The mean square error (MSE) is analytically derived for infinitely long filters in a quasi-static environment with multiple rays having different DOAs, and compared (for the two-path model) with simulation results assuming filters with a small number of taps.

In some cases, the performance is even worse than that without cancellation, due to the lack of the exact knowledge of the interfering signal in cancellation. Partial interference cancellation suggested by Divsalar and Simon (see IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.46, p.258-68, 1998) tries to remedy this weakness by reducing the cost of a wrong interference estimation through a weight in each stage. This paper presents an adaptive multistage structure based on the partial interference cancellation approach. In this structure, the weights are obtained by minimizing the mean-square error between the received signal and its estimate through a least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The resulting weights contain reliability information for the hard decisions made in the previous stage. Neither a training sequence nor a pilot signal is needed in the proposed scheme, and its complexity is much lower than that of linear multiuser detectors. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can outperform some of the existing interference cancellation methods in both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the multipath fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/49.793316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17215/00793316.pdf","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.793316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive multistage parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive multistage parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6384507","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive multistage parallel interference cancellation for CDMA","sourcePdf":"00793316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039452S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"81","articleId":"793316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793317,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

The estimation of the far field is stated as an intersection finding problem and is solved by the minimization of a suitable functional. The difficulties related to the possible trapping of the algorithm by a false solution (common to any nonlinear inverse problem) are mitigated by setting the problem in the space of the squared field amplitudes (as already done in a number of existing papers) and by incorporating all the a priori knowledge concerning the system under test in the formulation of the problem. Accordingly, the a priori information concerning the far field, the near field outside the measurement region and the accuracy of the measurement setup and its dynamic range are properly taken into account in the objective functional. The intrinsic ill conditioning of the problem is managed by adopting a general, flexible, and nonredundant sampling representation of the field, which takes into account the geometrical characteristics of the source. As a consequence, the number of unknowns is minimized and a technique is obtained, which easily matches the available knowledge concerning the behavior of the field. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by reporting the main results of an extensive numerical analysis, as well as an experimental validation performed by using a very low cost near field facility available at the Electronic Engineering Department, University of Napoli, Italy.","doi":"10.1109/8.793317","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1385","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17213/00793317.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.793317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective near-field far-field transformation technique from truncated and inaccurate amplitude-only data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Phase measurement","Shape measurement","Inverse problems","Dynamic range","Geometry","State estimation","System testing","Sampling methods","Numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","function evaluation","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-field far-field transformation","truncated amplitude-only data","inaccurate amplitude-only data","amplitude only near-field data","intersection finding problem","functional minimization","false solution","nonlinear inverse problem","squared field amplitudes","system under test","measurement region","measurement setup accuracy","objective functional","ill conditioning","numerical analysis","experimental validation","very low cost near field facility","University of Napoli","Electronic Engineering Department","Italy","nonredundant sampling representation","geometrical characteristics","antenna radiation pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"An effective near-field far-field transformation technique from truncated and inaccurate amplitude-only data","volume":"47","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6386086","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective near-field far-field transformation technique from truncated and inaccurate amplitude-only data","sourcePdf":"00793317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034229S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"52","articleId":"793317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":793320,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To eliminate the DC link voltage ripple and the DC component of the reactive power, both positive- and negative-sequence currents should be controlled simultaneously, according to the paper by Rioual et al (1996). The authors used two synchronous reference frames: a positive-sequence current regulated by a proportional integral (PI) controller in a positive synchronous reference frame (SRF); and a negative-sequence current regulated by a PI controller in a negative SRF. In the positive SRF, which rotates counterclockwise, the positive sequence appears as DC, while the negative sequence appears as 120 Hz. In contrast, in the negative SRF, which rotates clockwise, the negative sequence appears as DC, while the positive sequence appears as 120 Hz. By deleting 120 Hz components using a notch filter in each SRF, one can measure positive- and negative-sequence currents separately, and use them for constructing two feedback controllers. Since the negative-sequence current is also controlled in its own SRF by a DC command, this approach yields better performance without increasing the control gain. Note that, since the controller is implemented by a software routine in the digital signal professor chip, using two SRFs does not require additional hardware. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme by using computer simulation and experiments.","doi":"10.1109/41.793344","startPage":"953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/17216/00793344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.793344","endPage":"959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual current control scheme for PWM converter under unbalanced input voltage conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dual current control scheme for PWM converter under unbalanced input voltage conditions","volume":"46","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6383637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual current control scheme for PWM converter under unbalanced input voltage conditions","sourcePdf":"00793344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026627S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"663","articleId":"793344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793345,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This scheme excites two phases of an SRM simultaneously, which is similar to the two-phase excitation method of a step motor. In this scheme, the torque is produced by mutual-inductance as well as by self-inductance. The abrupt change of a phase excitation produces mechanical stresses, resulting in torque ripple and noise. The acoustic noise is reduced through a sequential two-phase excitation. Noise reduction occurs because the scheme reduces abrupt changes in excitation levels by distributed, balanced excitation and freewheeling during commutation. The operational principle and a characteristic comparison to that of the conventional SRM show that this novel excitation scheme has some advantages, including torque ripple and noise reduction, as well as simple inverter topology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-phase switched reluctance motor with two-phase excitation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.793367","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17214/00793367.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.793367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A three-phase switched reluctance motor with two-phase excitation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379161","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-phase switched reluctance motor with two-phase excitation","sourcePdf":"00793367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033758S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"91","articleId":"793367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793368,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Koo Kang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jun-Koo Kang","id":"37273712100"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37267508300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"793368","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":330,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3669},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, a direct torque control (DTC) method of an induction machine is proposed which enables the minimum torque ripple control, while maintaining constant switching frequency. Some drawbacks of the conventional DTC are the relatively large torque ripple in a low speed range and the variation of switching frequency according to the amplitude of hysteresis bands and the motor operating speed. In the proposed strategy, an RMS torque-ripple equation is derived using instantaneous torque equations and, at each switching cycle, an optimal switching instant which satisfies the minimum torque-ripple condition is determined based on the ripple equation. The proposed strategy improves the performance of the DTC by combining a low-torque-ripple characteristic in steady state with the fast torque dynamics. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed strategy as compared with the conventional method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17214/00793368.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.793368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.793368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New direct torque control of induction motor for minimum torque ripple and constant switching frequency","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Induction motors","Equations","Switching frequency","Voltage","Stators","Hysteresis motors","Rotors","Traction motors","Induction machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","machine control","torque control","switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct torque control","induction motor","minimum torque ripple","constant switching frequency","switching frequency variation","hysteresis band amplitude","motor operating speed","RMS torque-ripple equation","instantaneous torque equations","switching cycle","optimal switching instant","minimum torque-ripple condition","ripple equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"New direct torque control of induction motor for minimum torque ripple and constant switching frequency","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379162","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New direct torque control of induction motor for minimum torque ripple and constant switching frequency","sourcePdf":"00793368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033344S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"330","articleId":"793368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793371,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

An alternative is the matrix converter, which consists of nine bidirectional switches. This converter has benefits compared to a standard inverter, like sinusoidal input current and bidirectional power flow. The main disadvantage is the lack of a bidirectional switch, because such a switch may be done by two transistors and two diodes. An important topic is protection of the matrix converter, and this paper proposes two new protection circuits for matrix converters with a reduced number of components. The number of protection diodes is reduced by six. Design expressions of the protection circuit are calculated and validated by simulation. The standard protection circuit and the new circuits are demonstrated by simulation to have the same performance. Experimental results on an 8 kVA matrix converter show the design expressions are correct. It is concluded that it is possible to reduce the necessary power components in a matrix converter.","doi":"10.1109/28.793377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17214/00793377.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.793377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New protection issues of a matrix converter: design considerations for adjustable-speed drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793377/","displayDocTitle":"New protection issues of a matrix converter: design considerations for adjustable-speed drives","volume":"35","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6379171","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New protection issues of a matrix converter: design considerations for adjustable-speed drives","sourcePdf":"00793377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04798S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"119","articleId":"793377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793408,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Heon Lee","affiliation":["Department of electronics engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Heon Lee","id":"37441031200"},{"name":"Hye-Ju Seo","affiliation":["Department of electronics engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hye-Ju Seo","id":"37876159100"},{"name":"Ho-Jun Song","affiliation":["Department of electronics engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ho-Jun Song","id":"37343948500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"793408","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design and implementation of a 10-MHz bandwidth WLL (wireless local loop) intermediate-frequency (IF) transceiver integrated circuit.

paper, adaptive algorithms for updating the coefficients of an equalizer and a 2-state Viterbi detector for a partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) detector in a digital versatile disc record

The conventional partial response (PR) equalization method, derived under the conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, exhibits performance degradation due to high-frequency noise enhancement effect of the equalizer in the process of compensating the low pass characteristic of an optical channel with an eight-to-fourteen modulation-plus (EFMPlus) coded input. The proposed equalization method achieves performance improvement by effectively equalizing the channel output at the important points, i.e. zero-crossing points, where the information on actual recorded bits is stored. Considering the speed limit of the FPGA chip, the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is implemented by a 2-state Viterbi algorithm which has similar performance to the original 6-state Viterbi detector by selecting an appropriate value for threshold. Following performance analyses of the proposed algorithms for PRML detector by various computer simulation, the PRML detector is implemented by FPGA chip.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6386202","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A PRML detector for a DVDR system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PRML detector for a DVDR system","sourcePdf":"00793410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033932S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"17223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"11","articleId":"793410","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":793415,"authors":[{"name":"J.C. de Mateo Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Communications Technologies, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"J.C.","lastName":"de Mateo Garcia","id":"37269507100"},{"name":"A.

The bit error probability is derived for a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel. In the OFDM/CDMA system, OFDM and CDMA are combined to exploit the advantages of both techniques. For decoding the turbo code, a MAP decoding algorithm is employed. Implementation issues are discussed for OFDM, a CDMA system, and a turbo decoding procedure. From the simulation results, it is demonstrated that turbo coding offers considerable coding gain with reasonable encoding/decoding complexity. Also, it is shown that the BER performance is substantially improved by increasing the interleaver length for a fixed code rate and the increasing number of iterations used in the decoding process. The results in the paper can be applied to the design of OFDM-based CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/30.793422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/17223/00793422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.793422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17223","startPage":"372","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of OFDM/CDMA system with turbo coding in a multipath fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of OFDM/CDMA system with turbo coding in a multipath fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1999","accessionNumber":"6386214","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of OFDM/CDMA system with turbo coding in a multipath fading channel","sourcePdf":"00793422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026609S","chronDate":"May 1999","isNumber":"17223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"13","articleId":"793422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793424,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These instruments can be freely downloaded and the remote user can access the laboratory facilities from anywhere at any time. Our Internet-accessed remote laboratory is based on a client/server computer configuration. The server, situated near the experiment, transfers to it the received command signals transmitted by the client. The client locally computes the command signal based on the reference waveform and the transmitted system response. The remote user can select the transmission protocol, switch between asynchronous and synchronous sampling, use either a batch or a recursive data transfer mode, and view the experimental testbed. Our approach is distinct from others in that it offers more flexibility and responsibility to the client side, since the remote user compiles and executes the controller locally. Issues concerned with network reliability, dynamic delays caused by Internet traffic, concurrent user access, and limited computing power have been addressed. The designed set of experiments is the first step toward our remote control laboratory.","doi":"10.1109/37.793435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.793435","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/17228/00793435.pdf","startPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Internet-based real-time control engineering laboratory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793435/","displayDocTitle":"An Internet-based real-time control engineering laboratory","volume":"19","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6377432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Internet-based real-time control engineering laboratory","sourcePdf":"00793435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051774S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"164","articleId":"793435","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793442,"authors":[{"name":"P.

With the switching losses in the primary being minimised, the secondary diode losses become a major limiting factor of converter operating frequency and total efficiency. To address this problem, a new active lossless clamp for secondary diodes of switch mode converters is proposed. The clamp recycles diode reverse recovery energy stored in the transformer leakage inductance and allows diodes with smaller reverse voltage to be used in the output circuit. A double reduction of power loss is obtained by recovering the leakage inductance energy and through lower conduction loss of the output diodes. The clamp operates over the full range of load from open circuit to short circuit and is fully compatible with resonant transition type circuits. This paper analyses the operation of the proposed regenerative clamp and discusses the application to various secondary circuits. Finally, the clamp operation is verified by experimental results obtained from the application of the regenerative clamp on a compact 3 kW rectifier.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTLEC.1998.793553","publicationTitle":"INTELEC - Twentieth International Telecommunications Energy Conference (Cat.

We present a new approach for edge detection. The actual gray level image is locally thresholded using the local mean value to make a binary image. The binary image is checked for edges by comparison with the known edge like patterns, utilizing Boolean algebra. This approach recognizes nearly all-actual edges and edges due to noise. For removing edges due to noise, we adopt another approach. This time the actual image is globally thresholded by the variance value of the image.

Accelerated dry-out of the battery can occur thus reducing the life of the battery and create conditions favorable for thermal events. The culprit is the combined full output current capacity of the rectifiers/battery chargers in a power plant. The accepted objective of the rectifiers/battery chargers is to return the load bus and the batteries to the float voltage setting as quickly as possible. A vast majority of the DC power plants in operation today have a charging capacity excess, including the redundant rectifier, which can deliver full output current at recharge (the period following the return of AC power after a discharge of the batteries). The paper shows how a controlled recharge of the VRLA batteries can return the battery to its full capacity with minimal dry-out and no risk of a thermal event. Control of the amount and rate of current delivered to the battery during recharge can be achieved through power electronics. Methods for new and existing installations are discussed with cost effectiveness addressed. The paper utilizes test data to show the different recharge results and how the different recharge regimes compare. Included in the paper are tables and corresponding graphs to show the differences in the methods of recharge.

It utilizes the hierarchical pyramid structure that provides multiple resolutions. The DWT decomposes the image into several bands. In each band, a fixed-size motion compensated MPEG coder with custom-designed quantization tables and scanning direction is employed. This scheme has the advantages of reusing the widely available MPEG hardware and software as well as relieving the limitation of the image size imposed by the MPEG hardware technology.

The novel solar cell power supply system using the buck-boost type two-input DC-DC converter is proposed, in which the solar array and the commercial AC line are exploited as power sources and they are combined by the two input windings of the energy-storage reactor. Also, its operation principle and performance characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, the solar cell optimum operating point tracker is proposed and examined. It is confirmed by the experiment that the proposed solar cell power supply system has the excellent performance characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/INTLEC.1998.793656","publicationTitle":"INTELEC - Twentieth International Telecommunications Energy Conference (Cat.

Empirical evidence suggests that overloaded servers can have significant impact on user perceived response times. Furthermore, FIFO scheduling done by servers can eliminate any QoS improvements made by network-differentiated services. Consequently, server QoS is a key component in delivering end to end predictable, stable, and tiered services to end users. This article describes our research and results for WebQoS, an architecture for supporting server QoS. We demonstrate that through classification, admission control, and scheduling, we can support distinct performance levels for different classes of users and maintain predictable performance even when the server is subjected to a client request rate that is several times greater than the server's maximum processing rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6379775","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Web server support for tiered services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web server support for tiered services","sourcePdf":"00793694.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049705S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"142","articleId":"793694","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793703,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Based on the spatiotemporal feature extraction model of Adelson and Bergen, the pixel is realized using a general-purpose analog neural computer and a silicon retina. Because the neural computer only offers sum-and-threshold neurons, the Adelson and Bergen's model is modified. The quadratic nonlinearity is replaced with a full-wave rectification, while the contrast normalization is replaced with edge detection and thresholding. Motion is extracted in two dimensions by using two 1-D detectors with spatial smoothing orthogonal to the direction of motion. Analysis shows that our pixel, although it has some limitations, has much lower hardware complexity compared to the full 2-D model. It also produces more accurate results and has a reduced aperture problem compared to the two 1-D model with no smoothing. Real-time velocity is represented as a distribution of activity of the 18 X and 18 Y velocity-tuned neural filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17231/00793703.pdf","startPage":"1121","endPage":"1136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.793703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.793703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of a visual-motion pixel using oriented spatiotemporal neural filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Motion detection","Detectors","Smoothing methods","Motion measurement","Two dimensional displays","Very large scale integration","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Feature extraction","Analog computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","VLSI","spatial filters","neural chips","edge detection","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual motion detection","VLSI neural filter","spatiotemporal feature extraction model","analog neural computer","silicon retina","full-wave rectification","edge detection","thresholding","2D measurement","1D detector","vision chip","pixel hardware","smoothing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of a visual-motion pixel using oriented spatiotemporal neural filters","volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6400515","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of a visual-motion pixel using oriented spatiotemporal neural filters","sourcePdf":"00793703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057559S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"23","articleId":"793703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":793710,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The method is based on the binomial series. It results in hierarchical and modular structures with low hardware complexity for low-pass and high-pass filters. For a filter of a given order, the structures provide access to ail maximally flat filters of lower orders. Two types of structures are presented. The first enjoys a set of multiplier coefficients with reduced dynamic range, and the second can be realized free of multiplier coefficients in a modular manner. Extension of the order of the filter can be achieved by cascading additional building blocks for the former structure or by adding an extra layer of modules for the latter structure. The proposed structures and formulas are applicable to maximally flat Hilbert transformers as well.","doi":"10.1109/82.793712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17231/00793712.pdf","startPage":"1225","endPage":"1230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.793712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplierless and hierarchical structures for maximally flat half-band FIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793712/","displayDocTitle":"Multiplierless and hierarchical structures for maximally flat half-band FIR filters","volume":"46","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6400524","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplierless and hierarchical structures for maximally flat half-band FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00793712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080396S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"11","articleId":"793712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793714,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Southern Taiwan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pei-Yin Chen","id":"37311131600"},{"name":"Jet Min Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jet Min Jou","id":"37289288700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7130"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-125X"}],"articleNumber":"793714","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793714","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Very large scale integration","Signal processing algorithms","Fuzzy reasoning","Videoconference","Prediction algorithms","Global Positioning System","Video compression","Hardware","High definition video"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","VLSI","digital signal processing chips","search problems","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","fuzzy prediction search algorithm","image block motion estimation","fuzzy reasoning","simulation","66 MHz"]}],"abstract":"An efficient search algorithm for block motion estimation is proposed in this paper.

The optical signal may have to traverse a number of crossconnect switches (XCSs), fiber segments, and optical amplifiers, e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). Thus, while propagating through the network, the signal may degrade in quality as it encounters crosstalk at the XCSs and also picks up amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise at the EDFAs. Since these impairments continue to degrade the signal quality as it progresses toward its destination, the received bit error rate (BER) at the destination node might become unacceptably high. Previous work on the lightpath routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem assumed an ideal physical layer and ignored these transmission impairments. The main contribution of our work is to incorporate the role of the physical layer in setting up lightpaths by employing appropriate models of multiwavelength optical devices (XCSs and EDFAs) such that the BER of a candidate lightpath can be computed, in advance, to determine if this lightpath should be used for the call. Features from existing RWA algorithms are integrated with our on-line BER calculation mechanism. Our simulation studies indicate that employing BER-based call-admission algorithms has a significant impact on the performance of realistic networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of transmission impairments on the teletraffic performance of wavelength-routed optical networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.793740","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17233/00793740.pdf","startPage":"1713","endPage":"1723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.793740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=793740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Impact of transmission impairments on the teletraffic performance of wavelength-routed optical networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6398612","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of transmission impairments on the teletraffic performance of wavelength-routed optical networks","sourcePdf":"00793740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058902S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"249","articleId":"793740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":793744,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Transmission with a bit error rate better than 10/sup -10/ on nondispersion shifted fiber is experimentally demonstrated over 320 km and the dispersion from 1000 km of fiber was effectively equalized in simulation. In the transmitter, driving one or two modulators with a combination of a baseband digital signal and the Hilbert transform of that signal creates an optical single sideband signal. In terms of reducing the effects of chromatic dispersion, transmitting the signal in a single sideband format has two advantages over a double sideband format. First, the optical bandwidth of the transmitted single sideband signal is approximately one half of a conventional double sideband signal. Second, an optical single sideband signal with transmitted carrier can be \"self-homodyne\" detected and the majority of the phase information preserved since no spectrum back folding occurs upon detection. This allows the received signal to be partially equalized in the electrical domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6398615","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optical single sideband transmission at 10 Gb/s using only electrical dispersion compensation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical single sideband transmission at 10 Gb/s using only electrical dispersion compensation","sourcePdf":"00793744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032137S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"119","articleId":"793744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":793746,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We confirmed that the proposed DDF's can not only suppress PWM but also improve the input power limitation for WDM systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/793758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6398624","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Four-wave mixing suppression effect of dispersion distributed fibers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-wave mixing suppression effect of dispersion distributed fibers","sourcePdf":"00793758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037041S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","articleId":"793758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":793784,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiping Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Zhiping Lin","id":"37277999300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"793784","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","MIMO","Linear systems","Adaptive control","Stability","Programmable control","Automatic control","Polynomials","Multidimensional systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","linear systems","poles and zeros","multidimensional systems","MIMO systems","compensation","polynomials","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback stabilization","MIMO 3D linear systems","double coprime factorizations","unstable zeros","matrix fraction descriptions","parameterization","stabilizing compensators","unstable polynomial","stable polynomial"]}],"abstract":"The authors solve the open problem of the existence of double coprime factorizations for a large class of multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) three-dimensional (3-D) linear systems.

Many multimedia applications, such as videophones, videoconferencing, man-machine interface, language dubbing, character animation in virtual reality, etc., require techniques for synchronizing audio and video in a synthesized talking head sequence. For these applications, it is necessary to reliably estimate accurate mouth (visual) movements from the corresponding speech (audio) data. The hidden Markov model inversion (HMMI) technique introduced for robust speech recognition is extended in this paper into the audio-visual feature space. Based on the Baum-Welch HMMI method, reliable visual parameters are extracted given speech data only. Our preliminary simulation results show that the estimated visual parameters from the proposed method match the true visual parameters smoothly as well as accurately. The proposed estimation technique can be combined with video coding and graphics techniques for other multimedia applications.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.1999.793816","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Third Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (Cat.

We present a novel technique in which we dynamically alter the motion estimation algorithm thereby impacting the execution rate and hence the power consumed. An average reduction of 30% in memory accesses and 60% in arithmetic operations, as compared to the full search block matching algorithm, was observed for the test cases.

While a case can be made that all telecom loads should be powered from the DC source, the fact remains that today's telecom systems rely on AC powered equipment for all sorts of monitoring and control functions. This equipment is just as critical as the DC load, thus high availability AC power is also needed. Supplying this AC is not easy as the utility grid is prone to outages and transients while standard UPS systems usually require a separate battery plant and still fall short on availability. A key reason that AC inverters have not achieved the availability of DC converter systems is the problem of isolation and redundancy. While straightforward in DC systems, the four quadrant operation of inverters along with the need for phase matching complicates the solution for AC systems. Common synchronizing and control circuits are normally required to parallel inverters but these common circuits are vulnerable to single fault scenarios that can bring down the whole system. This paper describes a means to improve the isolation and redundancy of multiple-inverter systems by eliminating the common synchronizing and control circuits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless load sharing of single phase telecom inverters","publicationTitle":"21st International Telecommunications Energy Conference.

Compensating on only one error mechanism presents a problem when the dominant error mechanism changes with frequency. This paper presents a way to confront multiple error mechanisms at once and successfully compensate across the full band. Two error mechanisms addressed here are previous sample and signal slope dependent errors. This paper presents a model for error and estimates the error from the harmonics in the spectrum of the calibration signal. The error present in the fundamental component is treated as additional unknowns in the error estimate. Compensation of a simulated ADC resulted in a complete removal of all previous sample and slope dependent error. Hardware results were almost as impressive, showing gains in spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of up to 17 dB.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19990487","publicationTitle":"1999 Third International Conference on Advanced A/D and D/A Conversion Techniques and their Applications (Conf.

We propose a procedure for application-dependent self testing of an in-circuit reprogrammable FPGA and develop BIST schemes that preserve the FPGA timing. For these schemes, the reconfiguration of a portion of the FPGA into test resources has no impact on the timing characteristics of that part of the FPGA which is currently being tested. We also present a method for enhancing the susceptibility of FPGA delay faults to random testing. It is based on modifying the functions of programmable logic components in the section under test.

Here we propose the constructive induction approach to Learning Hardware based on Rough Sets Theory (RST). This approach allows the use of logical analysis to develop efficient hardware-realizable algorithms, and is contrasted with the popular Evolvable Hardware (EHW) approach in which learning/evolution is based on the genetic algorithm only. The RST algorithms have a natural high parallelism and high possible speed-ups. Using a fast prototyping tool, the DEC-PERLE-1 board based on an array of Xilinx FPGAs, we are developing a virtual SIMD processor that accelerates the learning (design) of optimized multi-valued logic nets.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 25th EUROMICRO Conference.

This paper, at first, describes a basic theory of the power control method using a variable inductance. Second, the concept of the power control method using variable inductance with a feedforward-based power controller is expressed. Simulations and experiments were carried out using the feedfoward-based power controller to verify the ability of this method. Then, the characteristics of the power control were analyzed for different line impedance by simulations. The results show that the transmission power can be quickly controlled using variable inductance with the feedfoward-based power controller in the case with a small line resistance, while transient oscillation is observed in the transmission power when a line is rather large. Third, a new transmission power control using a variable inductance with a power feedback-based controller is proposed, which can be applied to a power system with large line resistance. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by simulations. The transient response of the transmission power can be greatly improved using the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.1999.794534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.1999.794534","startPage":"46","endPage":"51 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1999 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems.

In this paper, the problem of stator flux drooping at low speeds has been investigated. By rotating the original flux sectors defined for conventional DTC near the sector boundaries, it is possible to maintain stator flux within the prescribed hysteresis bands and therefore improve the stator flux in the machine as well as the harmonic contents of stator currents. Moreover, the use of the proposed scheme also results in a reduction of overall inverter switching frequency. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation studies, and is also supported with experimental results obtained from a 1.5 kW induction motor driven in a laboratory environment.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.1999.794540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.1999.794540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17234","startPage":"80","endPage":"85 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1999 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems.

The measuring process of the proposed position sensor is developed by neural network learning with backpropagation. The number of lamps can be reduced from four to three without sacrificing sensor accuracy. This reduction in the number of lamps shortens acquisition time in graphic data processing.

Three kinds of typical pole assignments with identical radius/damping coefficient/real-part are applied and compared, and the merits of each pole assignment design are concluded. Furthermore, for small inertia ratio, we show how to improve the damping by a derivative feedback of motor speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/794627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 1999","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6475207","displayDocTitle":"Speed control of two-inertia system by PI/PID control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed control of two-inertia system by PI/PID control","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00794627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032138S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6444","citationCount":"8","articleId":"794627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":794661,"authors":[{"name":"Chau-Han Lee","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Chau-Han Lee","id":"37066033500"},{"name":"Shan Zhong","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Shan Zhong","id":"37336753300"},{"name":"Xiao Lin","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Xiao Lin","id":"38182976000"},{"name":"Yung Jui Chen","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Yung Jui Chen","id":"37337124900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5633-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"794661","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":24},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit synthesis","Phased arrays","Optical arrays","Thermooptical devices","Phase shifters","Decoding","Integrated optics","Multiaccess communication","Weight control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","optical arrays","integrated optoelectronics","optical phase shifters","optical communication equipment","encoding","decoding","thermo-optical effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar lightwave circuit design","programmable optical CDMA spectral encoder","programmable optical CDMA spectral decoder","array-waveguide grating","thermooptic phase shifter arrays","optical CDMA communications","high extinction spectral bit patterns","bit weight equalization control","programmable coding capability","monolithically integrated device","mass-production","telecommunication industry"]}],"abstract":"We have proposed a planar lightwave circuit that integrates one AWG and arrays of thermooptic phase shifters to construct a programmable spectral encoder/decoder for the application of optical CDMA communications.

This paper describes a new block-matching algorithm that is much faster than the full search algorithm and occasionally even produces better rate-distortion curves than the full search algorithms. We observe that a piecewise continuous motion field reduces the bit rate for differentially encoded motion vectors. Our motion estimation algorithm exploits the spatial correlations of motion vectors effectively in the sense of producing better rate-distortion curves. Furthermore, we incorporate such correlations in a multiresolution framework to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation shows that this method is successful because of the homogeneous and reliable estimation of the displacement vectors. In nine out of our ten benchmark simulations, the performance of the full search algorithm and that of our subblock multiresolution method is about the same. In one out of our ten benchmark simulations, our method has improvement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17237/00795051.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"1002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.795051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.795051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast rate-optimized motion estimation algorithm for low-bit-rate video coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Video coding","Video compression","Design for disassembly","Bit rate","Image coding","Spatial resolution","Computational complexity","Rate-distortion","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","data compression","rate distortion theory","motion estimation","computational complexity","image resolution","image matching","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast rate-optimized motion estimation algorithm","low-bit-rate video coding","real-time encoding","computational complexity reduction","compression efficiency","block-matching algorithm","full search algorithm","rate-distortion curves","full search algorithms","piecewise continuous motion field","bit rate reduction","differentially encoded motion vectors","spatial correlations","multiresolution framework","subblock multiresolution method","displacement vectors","benchmark simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A fast rate-optimized motion estimation algorithm for low-bit-rate video coding","volume":"9","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6395106","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast rate-optimized motion estimation algorithm for low-bit-rate video coding","sourcePdf":"00795051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068181S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"17","articleId":"795051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795055,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.W.

A variant of the proposed modification called the multiple-candidate two-step search (M2SSFS) is found to be particularly good for high quality, high bit rate video coding.

The model is generalized and can accommodate global object motions besides the motions due to the camera movements. Only the pan and the zoom global motions are considered because of their relatively more frequent occurrences in real video sequences. Besides the traditional least-squares estimation scheme, two more estimation schemes based on the minimization of the motion field bit rate and the global prediction error energy are proposed. Among the three estimation schemes, the iterative least-squares estimation is observed to be the best because of the least computational complexity, accuracy of the estimated parameters, and similar performance as with the other schemes. Four global motion compensation schemes including the existing pixel-based forward compensation are proposed. It is observed that backward compensation schemes perform similarly to the corresponding forward schemes except for having one frame delay degradation. The pixel based forward compensation is observed to have the best performance. A new motion vector coding scheme is proposed which has similar performance as the two-dimensional entropy coding but needs much less computation. Using the proposed coding scheme with the pixel-based forward compensation, we obtain 61.85% savings in motion field bit rate over the conventional motion compensation for the Tennis sequence.","doi":"10.1109/76.795060","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17237/00795060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.795060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17237","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative least squares and compression based estimations for a four-parameter linear global motion model and global motion compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative least squares and compression based estimations for a four-parameter linear global motion model and global motion compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6395114","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative least squares and compression based estimations for a four-parameter linear global motion model and global motion compensation","sourcePdf":"00795060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06134S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"38","articleId":"795060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":795061,"authors":[{"name":"Junehwa Song","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

However, it is difficult to process MPEG-2 for video browsing and database applications without first decompressing the video. Yeo and Liu (1995) have proposed fast algorithms for the direct extraction of spatially reduced images from MPEG-1 video. Reduced images have been demonstrated to be effective for shot detection, shot browsing and editing, and temporal processing of video for video presentation and content annotation. In this paper, we develop new tools to handle the extra complexity in MPEG-2 video for extracting spatially reduced images. In particular, we propose new classes of discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain and DCT inverse motion compensation operations for handling the interlaced modes in the different frame types of MPEG-2, and we design new and efficient algorithms for generating spatially reduced images of an MPEG-2 video. The algorithms proposed in this paper are fundamental for efficient and effective processing of MPEG-2 video.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6395115","volume":"9","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast extraction of spatially reduced image sequences from MPEG-2 compressed video","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast extraction of spatially reduced image sequences from MPEG-2 compressed video","sourcePdf":"00795061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05291S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"26","articleId":"795061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":795063,"authors":[{"name":"Q.T.

Difficulties in source modeling arise from the fact that VBR video source traffic usually follows a gamma distribution with high correlation among adjacent data. Many researchers adopt autoregressive (AR) models driven by a Gaussian error process to account for such correlation. The problem is: due to the closure property of the Gaussian distribution, the traffic so generated is Gaussian rather than gamma. As a remedy, some researchers directly consider gamma AR models instead. Unfortunately, the trouble arises from the fact that the closure property does not apply to gamma distributions, and thus, the linear operation performed by an AR model fails to produce gamma traffic. In this paper, we present a new technique that is capable of generating gamma-distributed traffic with arbitrary correlation while retaining the computational efficiency of Gaussian AR models. The central idea is to decompose given gamma traffic into a linear combination of a number of /spl lambda//sup 2/(1) sequences, and each of these latter processes can be easily obtained from a Gaussian AR process through a simple nonlinear operation. Results based on actual video teleconference data are presented to verify the validity of the new algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/76.795063","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.795063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17237/00795063.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general AR-based technique for the generation of arbitrary gamma VBR video traffic in ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795063/","displayDocTitle":"A general AR-based technique for the generation of arbitrary gamma VBR video traffic in ATM networks","volume":"9","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6395117","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general AR-based technique for the generation of arbitrary gamma VBR video traffic in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00795063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038463S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"17","articleId":"795063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":795067,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, Department de Genie Electrique et de Genie Informatique, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Lei Zhu","id":"37290348800"},{"name":"Ke Wu","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, Department de Genie Electrique et de Genie Informatique, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Ke Wu","id":"37278659100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"795067","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1426},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupling circuits","Design optimization","Resonator filters","Optical ring resonators","Microstrip filters","Microstrip resonators","Moment methods","Network topology","Circuit topology","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip filters","passive filters","resonators","equivalent circuits","method of moments","electromagnetic field theory","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint field/circuit model","line-to-ring coupling structures","microstrip dual-mode filters","ring resonator circuits","optimization","numerical deembedding technique","short-open calibration","deterministic method-of-moments scheme","design strategy","three-port topologies","equivalent network","extracted J-inverter susceptance parameters","coupling characteristics"]}],"abstract":"A joint field/circuit model is proposed in this paper to characterize a class of line-to-ring coupling structures for design and optimization of microstrip dual-mode filters and ring resonator circuits.

Differential equation-based numerical methods are known to produce inaccurate results for this type of problem due to the rapid spatial variation of the field distribution in the vicinity of the singularity at the edge of the metal fin. This problem is relevant to the analysis of structures of practical interest such as microstrip and coplanar waveguides. Based on simulations, it is determined that for identical discretizations, SCN-TLM is more accurate than FDTD for this problem. We interpret this result as an indication that the symmetric condensed representation of fields (used within the SCN-TLM) lends itself to a more accurate algorithm than the distributed representation used by Yee. We estimate that the FDTD method requires 3.33 times more cells for a given three-dimensional problem than the transmission-line matrix (TLM) method (1.49 times more cells per linear dimension of the problem) in order to achieve the same accuracy. If we consider the requirements to update and store a single TLM or FDTD cell, we find the SCN-TLM algorithm is more efficient than the Yee FDTD algorithm in terms of both computational effort and memory requirements. Our conclusions regarding computational effort and memory requirements are limited to problems with homogeneous material properties.","doi":"10.1109/22.795084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17236/00795084.pdf","startPage":"2042","endPage":"2045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.795084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of the transmission-line matrix and finite-difference time-domain methods for a problem containing a sharp metallic edge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795084/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the transmission-line matrix and finite-difference time-domain methods for a problem containing a sharp metallic edge","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6399279","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the transmission-line matrix and finite-difference time-domain methods for a problem containing a sharp metallic edge","sourcePdf":"00795084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033391S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"795084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795085,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Traditionally, units of this type have been hand-designed. In this paper, we propose a technique for the automatic synthesis of variable-latency units that is applicable to large data-path modules. We define and study an optimization problem, timed supersetting, whose solution is at the kernel of the procedure for automatic generation of variable-latency units. We contribute a new algorithm for solving timed supersetting in the most difficult case, that is, when the timing behavior of the circuit is expressed through an accurate delay model. The proposed solution overcomes the computational limitations of previous approaches and its robustness is experimentally demonstrated by obtaining high-throughput, variable-latency implementations for all the largest circuits in the Iscas '85 and Iscas '89 benchmark suites, as well as for some realistic, high-performance arithmetic units.","doi":"10.1109/12.795120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17242/00795120.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.795120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic synthesis of large telescopic units based on near-minimum timed supersetting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"Automatic synthesis of large telescopic units based on near-minimum timed supersetting","volume":"48","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"6386122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic synthesis of large telescopic units based on near-minimum timed supersetting","sourcePdf":"00795120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054976S","chronDate":"Aug 1999","isNumber":"17242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","articleId":"795120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":795122,"authors":[{"name":"L.G.

In this case, since area and delay of such circuits are critical factors, another parameter is introduced in the definition of balanced code: the \"number of balancing functions used in the code design\", p.

In such architectures, speculation may be employed to execute applications that cannot be parallelized statically. In this paper, we present an efficient CMP architecture for the speculative execution of sequential binaries without source recompilation. We present software support that enables the identification of threads from a sequential binary. The hardware includes a memory disambiguation mechanism that enables the detection of interthread memory dependence violations during speculative execution. This hardware is different from past proposals in that it does not rely on a snoopy-based cache-coherence protocol. Instead, it uses an approach similar to a directory-based scheme. Furthermore, the architecture includes a simple and efficient hardware mechanism to enable register-level communication between on-chip processors. Evaluation of this software-hardware approach shows that it is quite effective in achieving high performance when running sequential binaries.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17243/00795218.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.795218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.795218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A chip-multiprocessor architecture with speculative multithreading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multithreading","Hardware","Computer architecture","Application software","Registers","Logic","Microprocessors","Proposals","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip-multiprocessor architecture","speculative multithreading","thread-level parallelism","sequential binaries","software support","thread identification","memory disambiguation mechanism","inter-thread memory dependence violation detection","directory-based scheme","hardware mechanism","register-level communication","on-chip processor communication","software-hardware approach","performance","data-dependence speculation","control speculation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","displayDocTitle":"A chip-multiprocessor architecture with speculative multithreading","volume":"48","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6386131","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A chip-multiprocessor architecture with speculative multithreading","sourcePdf":"00795218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048621S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"151","articleId":"795218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":795224,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Chieh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Chieh Chang","id":"37281063400"},{"name":"L.P.P.P.

The optimization is based on incremental restructuring of a circuit through a sequence of additions and removals of redundant wires. Our algorithm applies the techniques of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), which can efficiently detect redundancies. During the ATPG process, certain nodes in the circuit must have particular logic assignments for a test to exist. Based on the properties of these mandatory assignments, we have developed theorems to eliminate unnecessary wire redundancy checking. This results in a significant performance improvement.

They have found widespread use in computer-aided design and in formal verification of digital circuits. Minimal trellises are graphical representations of error-correcting codes that play a prominent role in coding theory. This paper establishes a close connection between these two graphical models, as follows. Let /spl Cscr/ be a binary code of length n, and let f/sub c/(x/sub 1/, ..., x/sub n/) be the Boolean function that takes the value 0 at x/sub 1/, ..., x/sub n/ if and only if (x/sub 1/, ..., x/sub n/)/spl isin//spl Cscr/. Given this natural one-to-one correspondence between Boolean functions and binary codes, we prove that the minimal proper trellis for a code /spl Cscr/ with minimum distance d>1 is isomorphic to the single-terminal OBDD for its Boolean indicator function f/sub c/(x/sub 1/, ..., x/sub n/). Prior to this result, the extensive research during the past decade on binary decision diagrams (in computer engineering) and on minimal trellises (in coding theory) has been carried out independently. As outlined in this work, the realization that binary decision diagrams and minimal trellises are essentially the same data structure opens up a range of promising possibilities for transfer of ideas between these disciplines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6386138","displayDocTitle":"Ordered binary decision diagrams and minimal trellises","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordered binary decision diagrams and minimal trellises","sourcePdf":"00795225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069577S","chronDate":"Sep 1999","isNumber":"17243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","articleId":"795225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":795590,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Jo Kim","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, USA"],"lastName":"Byoung-Jo Kim","id":"37087277036"},{"name":"N.K.

The lengthy period of operation has allowed us to make observations about user behavior, weather-related channel impairments, and equipment performance. We have identified several design issues related to the application of cable modem technology to the fixed wireless environment. Also, we have measured a significant path loss effect arising from a combination of rain and foliage.","doi":"10.1109/35.795590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.795590","startPage":"56","endPage":"62","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17246/00795590.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The AT&T Labs broadband fixed wireless field experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"The AT&T Labs broadband fixed wireless field experiment","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6393999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795590/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The AT&T Labs broadband fixed wireless field experiment","sourcePdf":"00795590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036339S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"6","articleId":"795590","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":795603,"authors":[{"name":"Young Ki Yoon","affiliation":["Daewoo Telecom Research and Development Center"],"lastName":"Young Ki Yoon","id":"37871075600"},{"name":"M.

The unique features of CDMA technology make it a formidable alternative for fixed wireless telephone applications. The W-CDMA technology used by this WLL system is selected to provide primarily ISDN-like services and data rates to subscribers. This technology also provides a smooth transition into the third generation wireless technology. The air interface used in this WLL system is an interim TTA standard, which specifies a CDMA-based protocol operating in the 2.30-2.40 GHz band. The standard allows two types of bandwidth (5 and 10 MHz). The WLL system described in this article includes the WLL gateway switch, the radio port controller and the radio interface unit. The gateway switch connects the radio system to the PSTN and ISDN. The RPC provides concentration and control functions to a number of base stations called RPs. The RIU is comprised of the fixed units attached to the residential or commercial buildings. Also included are the radio port operation and maintenance (RPOM) unit, which is responsible for maintaining and managing the radio network elements, and the interworking function unit, which is used as a gateway to data services such as the Internet and PSPDN.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17246/00795603.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.795603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.795603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wireless local loop system based on wideband CDMA technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Switches","Telephony","Protocols","Bandwidth","Radio control","Control systems","ISDN","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","B-ISDN","radio access networks","telecommunication standards","access protocols","internetworking","telecommunication network management","maintenance engineering","telecommunication control","network interfaces","data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless local loop system","wideband CDMA technology","W-CDMA","WLL system","ISDN-like services","data rates","third generation wireless technology","air interface","interim TTA standard","CDMA-based protocol","bandwidth","WLL gateway switch","radio port controller","radio interface unit","PSTN","RPC","control functions","concentration functions","base stations","fixed units","commercial buildings","residential buildings","radio port operation and maintenance unit","radio network elements management","interworking function unit","data services","PSPDN","Internet","2.3 to 2.4 GHz","5 MHz","10 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A wireless local loop system based on wideband CDMA technology","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6393997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wireless local loop system based on wideband CDMA technology","sourcePdf":"00795603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035144S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"1","articleId":"795603","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":795608,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

Most developed into solid performers of mostly average productivity who did not substantially further Bell Labs' contribution to AT&T's competitive advantage in the marketplace. What the labs wanted to know was: what separates the star from the average performer? Is it innate or can star performance be learned? Could a program to improve productivity be designed that would help turn average performers into stars? Engineers from the best companies helped researchers to dispel the myths about star performers and uncover the surprising secrets of stellar achievement. To discover the secrets of star performance, the author and his colleagues used paper-and-pencil tests, direct observation, work diaries, focus groups, and individual interviews, drawing upon statistical analyses, content analyses, and iterative model building as appropriate. It was found that you need to change how you do your work and how you work with others. Star performers in fact do their work quite differently from the pack. They weave their starring strategies into a consistent pattern of day-to-day behavior. But any engineer with the necessary smarts and motivation can acquire their power. The author gives nine interlocking work strategies which can help engineers become star performers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795608/","volume":"36","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6393869","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"How to be a star engineer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to be a star engineer","sourcePdf":"1099-051Engineers.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033083S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"5","articleId":"795608","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795774,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

As a guide to an initial layout, an analytic model of multi-cell cavities excited in a n-mode was used to provide an expression for the transit-time factor as a function of particle velocity. A simple cavity-field distribution was assumed where the fields are uniform in the accelerating gaps and zero immediately outside the gaps. For APT the RF power delivered to the beam greatly exceeds the power dissipated in the superconducting walls. Then, the RF power required per cavity is approximately equal to the beam power, which is given as the product of the beam current times the particle energy gain per cavity.","doi":"10.1109/PAC.1999.795774","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 Particle Accelerator Conference (Cat.

The fuzzy-neural approximator is established to approximate an unknown nonlinear dynamic system in a linearized way. The fuzzy B-spline membership function (BMF) which possesses a fixed number of control points is developed for online tuning. The concept of tuning the adjustable vectors, which include membership functions and weighting factors, is described to derive the update laws of the robust adaptive fuzzy-neural controller. Furthermore, the effect of all the unmodeled dynamics, BMF modeling errors and external disturbances on the tracking error is attenuated by the error compensator which is also constructed by fuzzy-neural inference. We prove that the closed-loop system which is controlled by the robust adaptive fuzzy-neural controller is stable and the tracking error will converge to zero under mild assumptions.

Each robot is an omnidirectional mobile processor that repeatedly: 1) observes the relative positions of those robots that are visible; 2) computes its new position based on the observation using the given algorithm; 3) moves to that position. The robots' visibility is limited so that two robots can see each other if and only if they are within distance V of each other and there are no other robots between them. Our algorithm is memoryless in the sense that the next position of a robot is determined entirely from the positions of the robots that it can see at that moment. The correctness of the algorithm is proved formally under an abstract model of the robot system in which: 1) each robot is represented by a point that does not obstruct the view of other robots; 2) the robots' motion is instantaneous; 3) there are no sensor and control error; 4) the issue of collision is ignored. The results of computer simulation under a more realistic model give convincing indication that the algorithm, if implemented on physical robots, will be robust against sensor and control error.","doi":"10.1109/70.795787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/17252/00795787.pdf","startPage":"818","endPage":"828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.795787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed memoryless point convergence algorithm for mobile robots with limited visibility","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Distributed memoryless point convergence algorithm for mobile robots with limited visibility","volume":"15","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6394838","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed memoryless point convergence algorithm for mobile robots with limited visibility","sourcePdf":"00795787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039697S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"360","articleId":"795787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795789,"authors":[{"name":"M.

(see ibid., vol.46, p.973-76, 1998), it was shown that an inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey (1968, 1969) algorithm can be generalized to find the error locator polynomial in a Reed-Solomon (RS) decoder for correcting errors as well as erasures. The basic idea of this procedure is the replacement of the initial condition of an inverse-free BM algorithm by the Forney (1965) syndromes. It is shown that the errata locator polynomial can be obtained directly by initializing an inverse-free BM algorithm with the erasure locator polynomial and the syndromes. An important ingredient of this new algorithm is a modified BM algorithm for computing the errata locator polynomial. As a consequence, the separate computation of the erasure locator polynomial and the Forney syndrome, needed in the decoder developed by Truong et al., are completely avoided in this modification of the BM algorithm. This modified algorithm requires fewer finite field addition and multiplication operations than the previous algorithm. Finally, the new decoding method was implemented on a computer using C++ language. It is shown in a simulation that the speed of this new decoder is faster than the decoder developed by Truong et al. An example using this program is given for an (255, 239) RS code for correcting errors and erasures with 2/spl nu/+s/spl les/10.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17251/00795817.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.795817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.795817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On decoding of both errors and erasures of a Reed-Solomon code using an inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","Polynomials","Error correction codes","Error correction","Equations","Galois fields","Computational modeling","Computer errors","Audio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","decoding","coding errors","polynomials","C++ language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","Reed-Solomon code","error locator polynomial","Reed-Solomon decoder","error correction","finite field addition","Forney syndromes","modified BM algorithm","erasure locator polynomial","finite field multiplication","decoding method","C++ language","simulation","RS code","erasure correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"On decoding of both errors and erasures of a Reed-Solomon code using an inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6406618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On decoding of both errors and erasures of a Reed-Solomon code using an inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","sourcePdf":"00795817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074788S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"795817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795818,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

Desired signal and interferers are subject to flat Rayleigh fading, and the propagation channels are independent. An approximate expression of the probability density function of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived analytically. It is then applied to obtain the cumulative distribution function of the SINR, and the bit-error rate (BER) of some binary modulations, including coherent binary phase-shift keying. In the case of a single interferer, an exact analysis is performed to prove the validity of the approximation. In the case of multiple interferers, the accuracy of the approximation is assessed through simulations. Although limited to equipower interferers, this analysis is a convenient way of assessing the performance of optimum combining in some typical situations and comparing it with that of maximal-ratio combining. The final results are remarkably simple and provide a useful complement to previous analyzes, especially in the region of reasonably high BERs which are of practical interest.","doi":"10.1109/26.795819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17251/00795819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.795819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of optimum combining with multiple interferers in flat Rayleigh fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Diversity reception","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Antennas and propagation","Rayleigh channels","Probability density function","Signal analysis","Distribution functions","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","cellular radio","phase shift keying","error statistics","array signal processing","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum combining","multiple interferers","flat Rayleigh fading","performance analysis","multiple equal power interferers","noise","antenna elements","propagation channels","approximate expression","probability density function","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","output SINR","cumulative distribution function","bit-error rate","BER","binary modulation","coherent binary phase-shift keying","exact analysis","single interferer","simulations","maximal-ratio combining","high BER","BPSK","cellular systems","diversity receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of optimum combining with multiple interferers in flat Rayleigh fading","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6406620","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795819/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of optimum combining with multiple interferers in flat Rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"00795819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029471S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","articleId":"795819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":795820,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) which simultaneously detects all incoming signals is compared to a set of DFEs, each detecting one signal and rejecting the remaining as interference. We also introduce the existence of a zero-forcing solution to the equalization problem as an indicator of near-far resistance of different detector structures. Near-far resistance guarantees good performance if the noise level is low. Simulations show that with an increased number of users in the cell, the incremental performance degradation is small for the multiuser detector. We have also applied the proposed algorithms to experimental measurements from a DCS-1800 antenna array testbed. The results from these confirm that reuse within a cell is indeed possible using either an eight-element array antenna or a two-branch diversity sector antenna. Multiuser detection will, in general, provide better performance than interference rejection, especially when the power levels of the users differ substantially. The difference in performance is of crucial importance when the available training sequences are short.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17251/00795820.pdf","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.795820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.795820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reuse within a cell-interference rejection or multiuser detection?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Antenna arrays","Decision feedback equalizers","Signal detection","Interference","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Frequency","Communication channels","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","frequency allocation","cellular radio","decision feedback equalisers","antenna arrays","receiving antennas","radio receivers","frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference rejection","multiuser detection","antenna array","receiver","frequency-division multiple-access","time-division multiple-access","decision-feedback equalizer","DFE","zero-forcing solution","near-far resistance","detector structures","incremental performance degradation","multiuser detector","DCS-1800 antenna array testbed","reuse","eight-element array antenna","two-branch diversity sector antenna","1800 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Reuse within a cell-interference rejection or multiuser detection?","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6406621","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reuse within a cell-interference rejection or multiuser detection?","sourcePdf":"00795820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041144S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","articleId":"795820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":795821,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Correlated errors are modeled as a two state Markov process. A retransmission algorithm is used to correct errors, and the probability that a packet is not successfully delivered within D slots of its arrival is computed. In the presence of a smoothing buffer at the receiver, this is the probability that the jitter experienced by a packet is too large to be absorbed by the buffer itself. The cases of zero and nonzero roundtrip delay are studied separately, as are the conditions of perfect and imperfect feedback. Our results relate the achievable quality of service and the amount of traffic that can be served to the packet-error process parameters, which in turn are induced by the physical layer specifications. This relationship between the traffic and the channel parameters can be useful in making admission control decisions and in assessing the effect of physical layer design on the performance of higher layer protocols.","doi":"10.1109/26.795822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17251/00795822.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.795822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateness probability of a retransmission scheme for error control on a two-state Markov channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=795822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/795822/","displayDocTitle":"Lateness probability of a retransmission scheme for error control on a two-state Markov channel","volume":"47","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6406623","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateness probability of a retransmission scheme for error control on a two-state Markov channel","sourcePdf":"00795822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037491S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"58","articleId":"795822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":795824,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Are there methods to restore batteries that appear \"dead\"? In this article we explore the advantages and limitations of today's most popular battery systems. We examine the batteries not only in terms of energy density but address service life, load characteristics, maintenance requirements, self-discharge and operational costs. Since the nickel cadmium remains a standard against which other batteries are compared, we evaluate alternative chemistries against this classic battery type. The alternative chemistries are: Ni-MH, sealed Pb-acid, Li-ion, Li-polymer, and reusable alkaline batteries.

George Zavaliagkos and Thomas Colthurst worked on a different approach to this method that uses confidence scoring on the acoustic data itself to improve performance in the absence of any transcribed data, but their approach only yielded marginal results. Our initial efforts also provided only limited success with small amounts of data. We describe our approach to collecting almost unlimited amounts of accurately transcribed speech data. This information serves as training data for the acoustic model component of most high-accuracy speaker-independent speech-recognition systems.

An algorithm was previously proposed that estimates these displacements using phase differences of the corresponding base-band signals. A major advantage of these algorithms compared with correlation techniques is the computational efficiency. In this paper, an extension of the algorithm is presented that iteratively takes into account the time shifts of the signals to overcome the problems of aliasing and accuracy in the estimation of the phase shift. Thus, it can be proven that the algorithm is equivalent to the search of the maximum of the correlation function. Furthermore, a robust logarithmic compression is proposed that only compresses the envelope of the signal. This compression does not introduce systematic errors and significantly reduces decorrelation noise. The resulting algorithm is a computationally simple and very fast alternative to conventional correlation techniques, and the accuracy of strain images is improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6400040","pubMedId":"18244299","displayDocTitle":"A time-efficient and accurate strain estimation concept for ultrasonic elastography using iterative phase zero estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A time-efficient and accurate strain estimation concept for ultrasonic elastography using iterative phase zero estimation","sourcePdf":"00796111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030359S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"250","articleId":"796111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":796126,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.C.

The accuracy of the estimation formula was tested by comparing it with the spectral widths found by using conventional spectral estimation on simulated Doppler signals from pulsatile flow. The influence of acceleration, sample volume size, and time window duration on the Doppler spectral width was investigated for flow with blunt and parabolic velocity profiles passing through Gaussian-shaped sample volumes. Our results show that, for short duration windows, the spectral width is dominated by window broadening and that acceleration has a small effect on the spectral width. For long duration windows, the effect of acceleration must be taken into account. The size of the sample volume affects the spectral width of the Doppler signal in two ways: by intrinsic broadening and by the range of velocities passing through it. These effects act in opposite directions. The simple spectral width estimation formula was shown to have excellent agreement with widths calculated using the model and indicates the potential for correcting not only for window and nonstationarity broadening but also for intrinsic broadening.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.796126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17285","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/17285/00796126.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum of Doppler ultrasound signals from nonstationary blood flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectrum of Doppler ultrasound signals from nonstationary blood flow","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6400055","pubMedId":"18244314","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum of Doppler ultrasound signals from nonstationary blood flow","sourcePdf":"00796126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075484S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"18","articleId":"796126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":796130,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

The methodology ensures that developers make the best possible design decisions by providing decision-making criteria in the form of two axioms: the independence axiom suggests that the best designs maintain the independence of the functional requirements, ensuring that the design can achieve each function without inadvertently affecting any other function; the information axiom suggests that the best designs minimize their information content. Thus, the solution with the greatest likelihood of success is the simplest solution. Software developers can determine the quality of the design based upon the degree to which it satisfies the defined functional requirements; ensure that the design satisfies each function independently and that coupling, which could cause unintended consequences, does not occur; enjoy easier job assignment and team management because they can use the system architecture diagram to assign tasks and define the interrelationships between various modules or classes; and handle software change orders quickly and easily because the system architecture identifies the modules affected by a change.

The technique is compared with that based solely on a supervised training algorithm (i.e. backpropagation network classifier). It is then tested under different fault types, location, resistance and inception angle; different source capacities and load angles are also considered. All the test results show that the proposed fault classifier is very well suited for classifying fault types in double-circuit lines.","doi":"10.1109/61.796214","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/17286/00796214.pdf","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.796214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fault classification technique for double-circuit lines based on a combined unsupervised/supervised neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A novel fault classification technique for double-circuit lines based on a combined unsupervised/supervised neural network","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6379756","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fault classification technique for double-circuit lines based on a combined unsupervised/supervised neural network","sourcePdf":"00796214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02836S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"69","articleId":"796214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":796217,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Comprising two /spl plusmn/160 MVA voltage-sourced GTO-thyristor-based inverters, this installation is the first large-scale practical demonstration of the UPFC concept, and its completion is a significant milestone in the progress of power electronics technology for flexible AC transmission system (FACTS). This paper briefly reviews the main features of the Inez installation and discusses the operation of the equipment. A collection of measured performance characteristics is presented to illustrate the unique capabilities of the UPFC. These dynamic measurements were made in the course of commissioning, and they graphically illustrate the ability of the UPFC to independently control the real and reactive power on a transmission line, while also regulating the local bus voltage. The results include a demonstration of the series inverter at Inez, operating in stand-alone mode.

The head-end scheduling algorithm is not defined within the standard but it is the key function for providing the required performance capability. Computer simulation, using the Common Simulation Framework (CSF) 12 version of the CableLabs DOCSIS 1.0 computer model, has been used to predict the upstream system throughput and mean access delay. A prioritised first come first served scheduling algorithm has been considered to provide a baseline reference set of performance statistics against which other algorithms can be compared. The simulations, with theoretical confirmation, have shown that the maximum sustainable system throughput is 1965 kbps for a channel capacity of 2560 kbps and a packet size of 1500 octets, whereas for packet size of 100 octets the maximum sustainable throughput is only 1550 kbps. The mean access delay is found to vary between 10-900 ms depending on the offered load and assuming that the offered load does not exceed the capacity of the channel. Excess offered load causes service starvation according to the assigned priority.","doi":"10.1109/11.796261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/17291/00796261.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.796261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance characterisation of the MCNS DOCSIS 1.0 CATV protocol with prioritised first come first served scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796261/","displayDocTitle":"Performance characterisation of the MCNS DOCSIS 1.0 CATV protocol with prioritised first come first served scheduling","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1999","accessionNumber":"6372920","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance characterisation of the MCNS DOCSIS 1.0 CATV protocol with prioritised first come first served scheduling","sourcePdf":"00796261.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06205S","chronDate":"Jun 1999","isNumber":"17291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"29","articleId":"796261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":796266,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Zhang","affiliation":["Institution of Infoimation Technology, Mid-Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"lastName":"Tingting Zhang","id":"37288851100"},{"name":"Youshi Xu","affiliation":["Institution of Infoimation Technology, Mid-Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"lastName":"Youshi Xu","id":"37335132500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"796266","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal packet loss protection for layered video transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation losses","Protection","Performance loss","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Numerical analysis","Bandwidth","Automatic repeat request","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual communication","video coding","packet switching","image reconstruction","multimedia communication","multicast communication","digital video broadcasting","data compression","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal packet loss protection","layered video transmission","packet dropping","picture reconstruction","performance","UPLP parameters design","numerical analysis","communication quality","packet loss rate","efficient bandwidth utilization","ARQ protocols","multimedia multicasting","heterogeneous networks","digital video broadcasting systems","receivers","signal processing","resolutions","layered video compression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/11.796266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/17291/00796266.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.796266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17291","abstract":"A general model for the transmission of layered video is introduced.

The numerical analysis shows that the unequal packet loss protection can significantly improve the communication quality, in the sense of packet loss rate on reconstructing pictures, without any additional complexity in the network infrastructure. It is also shown that application of UPLP can achieve a more efficient bandwidth utilization than the application of ARQ protocols.

Moreover, the low-cost design of OF-CDM transmitters is presented, and experimental demonstrations are also carried out. The measured results show that a transmission distance up to 13 km can be feasibly accomplished by using the proposed transmitter design and the external optical injection-locking scheme. It is expected that the proposed ISDB systems can be employed to cost-effectively transmit fast ethernet (125 Mbit/s), FDDI (125 Mbit/s), ATM (155 Mbit/s), and ESCON (200 Mbit/s) protocol data.

Furthermore it enables the feasibility of adaptive equalization schemes, where the quality of the channel estimation varies according to both channel characteristics and speed of the channel variations. The 16/32 bit fixed point architecture leads to a very low implementation loss, and a careful optimization of the pipeline architecture of the processor allows the receiver to obtain short processing delays.

In this scheme, signals assigned randomly in partial subbands are duplicated and concatenated repetitively to generate each subblock. The proposed scheme, therefore, has a form of concatenation of pseudo-random and interleaved SPS. As results of simulations, the proposed scheme shows almost same PAPR reduction performance as compared to the conventional pseudo-random SPS which has been known to have the best performance. However, computational complexity can be reduced extensively.

Traditional methods of classifier training attempt to combine these two objective functions (or two analogous class performance measures) into one so that conventional scalar optimization techniques can be utilized. This involves incorporating a priori information into the aggregation method so that the resulting performance of the classifier is satisfactory for the task at hand. The authors have investigated the use of a niched Pareto multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) for classifier optimization. With niched Pareto GA's, an objective vector is optimized instead of a scalar function, eliminating the need to aggregate classification objective functions. The niched Pareto GA returns a set of optimal solutions that are equivalent in the absence of any information regarding the preferences of the objectives. The a priori knowledge that was used for aggregating the objective functions in conventional classifier training can instead be applied post-optimization to select from one of the series of solutions returned from the multiobjective genetic optimization. The authors have applied this technique to train a linear classifier and an artificial neural network (ANN), using simulated datasets. The performances of the solutions returned from the multiobjective genetic optimization represent a series of optimal (sensitivity, specificity) pairs, which can be thought of as operating points on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. All possible ROC curves for a given dataset and classifier are less than or equal to the ROC curve generated by the niched Pareto genetic optimization.","doi":"10.1109/42.796281","startPage":"675","endPage":"685","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17288/00796281.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.796281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective genetic optimization of diagnostic classifiers with implications for generating receiver operating characteristic curves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pareto optimization","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Sensitivity and specificity","Genetic algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Radiology","Feature extraction","Pathology","Diseases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image classification","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic optimization","diagnostic classifiers","receiver operating characteristic curves generation","analogous class performance measures","a priori information","niched Pareto multiobjective genetic algorithm","classifier optimization","objective vector","scalar function","optimal solutions set","linear classifier training","artificial neural network","simulated datasets","niched Pareto genetic optimization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Neural Networks (Computer)","ROC Curve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective genetic optimization of diagnostic classifiers with implications for generating receiver operating characteristic curves","volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6411020","pubMedId":"10534050","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective genetic optimization of diagnostic classifiers with implications for generating receiver operating characteristic curves","sourcePdf":"00796281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040347S","chronDate":"Aug.  1999","isNumber":"17288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"57","articleId":"796281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":796284,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, the authors have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/42.796284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17288/00796284.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.796284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796284/","displayDocTitle":"Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images","volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6411023","pubMedId":"10534053","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images","sourcePdf":"00796284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040427S","chronDate":"Aug.  1999","isNumber":"17288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"3409","articleId":"796284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":796288,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Zhang","affiliation":["Information Systems Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Feng Zhang","id":"37280277600"},{"name":"Yan Qiu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yan Qiu Chen","id":"37281041800"},{"name":"Guoan Bi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Guoan Bi","id":"37280818700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"796288","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis","Power harmonic filters","Speech analysis","Acceleration","Signal analysis","Signal resolution","Interference","Bismuth","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","harmonic analysis","time-frequency analysis","speech enhancement","signal representation","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive harmonic fractional Fourier transform","voiced speech signal analysis","base tone","harmonics","time-frequency domain","rotation","time axis","high concentration","short time Fourier transform","Wigner-Ville distribution","STFT","speech enhancement","time-frequency representation","resolution improvement"]}],"abstract":"A novel adaptive harmonic fractional Fourier transform is proposed for analysis of voiced speech signals.

When compared to longer pulsewidth nanosecond or picosecond laser pulses, femtosecond laser-tissue interactions are characterized by significantly smaller and more deterministic photodisruptive energy thresholds, as well as reduced shock waves and smaller cavitation bubbles. We utilized a highly reliable all-solid-state femtosecond laser system for all studies to demonstrate practicality in real-world operating conditions. Contiguous tissue effects were achieved by scanning a 5-/spl mu/m focused laser spot below the corneal surface at pulse energies of approximately 2-4 /spl mu/J. A variety of scanning patterns was used to perform three prototype procedures in animal eyes; corneal flap cutting, keratomileusis, and intrastromal vision correction. Superior dissection and surface quality results were obtained for lamellar procedures (corneal flap cutting and keratornileusis). Preliminary in vivo studies of intrastromal vision correction suggest that consistent refractive changes can also be achieved with this method. We conclude that femtosecond laser technology may be able to perform a variety of corneal refractive procedures with high precision, offering advantages over current mechanical and laser devices and techniques.","doi":"10.1109/2944.796309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2944.796309","endPage":"910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/17287/00796309.pdf","startPage":"902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corneal refractive surgery with femtosecond lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796309/","displayDocTitle":"Corneal refractive surgery with femtosecond lasers","volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6417174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Corneal refractive surgery with femtosecond lasers","sourcePdf":"00796309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041377S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"232","articleId":"796309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":796325,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The best basis search is performed in families of orthonormal bases constructed with wavelet packets or local cosine bases. We base our search for the \"best\" basis on a criterion of minimal reconstruction error of the underlying signal. This approach is intuitively appealing, because the enhanced or estimated signal has an associated measure of performance, namely, the resulting mean-square error. Previous approaches in this framework have focused on obtaining the most \"compact\" signal representations, which consequently contribute to effective denoising. These approaches, however, do not possess the inherent measure of performance which our algorithm provides. We first propose an estimator of the mean-square error, based on a heuristic argument and subsequently compare the reconstruction performance based upon it to that based on the Stein (1981) unbiased risk estimator. We compare the two proposed estimators by providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bias term. Having two estimators of the mean-square error, we incorporate these cost functions into the search for the \"best\" basis, and subsequently provide a substantiating example to demonstrate their performance.","doi":"10.1109/18.796365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796365.pdf","startPage":"2225","endPage":"2238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796365","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On denoising and best signal representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"On denoising and best signal representation","volume":"45","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"6418546","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On denoising and best signal representation","sourcePdf":"00796365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049593S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"141","articleId":"796365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":796370,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The complexity and redundancy characteristics of the algorithm are comparable to those of its lossless counterpart. A heuristic argument suggests that the redundancy is of order (log log m)/log m, and this is also confirmed experimentally; simulation results are presented that agree well with this rate. Also, the complexity of the algorithm is seen to be comparable to that of the corresponding lossless scheme. We show that there is a tradeoff between compression performance and encoding complexity, and we discuss how the relevant parameters can be chosen to balance this tradeoff in practice. We also discuss the performance of the algorithm when applied to sources with memory, and extensions to the cases of unbounded distortion measures and infinite reproduction alphabets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796370.pdf","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2305","doi":"10.1109/18.796370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An implementable lossy version of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm.

This is a structurally constrained vector quantizer that uses unions of product codebooks. SAPQ is based on a concept of adaptive quantization to the varying samples of the source and is very different from traditional adaptation techniques for nonstationary sources. SAPQ quantizes each source sample using a sequence of quantizers. Even when using scalar quantization in SAPQ, we can achieve performance comparable to vector quantization (with the complexity still close to that of scalar quantization). We also show that important lattice-based vector quantizers can be constructed using scalar quantization in SAPQ. We mathematically analyze SAPQ and propose a algorithm to implement it. We numerically study SAPQ for independent and identically distributed Gaussian and Laplacian sources. Through our numerical study, we find that SAPQ using scalar quantizers achieves typical gains of 13 dB in distortion over the Lloyd-Max quantizer. We also show that SAPQ can he used in conjunction with vector quantizers to further improve the gains.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","vector quantisation","adaptive codes","feedforward","lattice theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample-adaptive product quantizer","SAPQ","feedforward adaptive quantization scheme","structurally constrained vector quantizer","product codebooks","scalar quantization","performance","complexity","lattice-based vector quantizers","Gaussian sources","Laplacian source","independent and identically distributed source","distortion","gain","i.i.d source"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.796371","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796371.pdf","startPage":"2306","endPage":"2320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization based on a novel sample-adaptive product quantizer (SAPQ)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantization based on a novel sample-adaptive product quantizer (SAPQ)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796371/","volume":"45","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6418552","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization based on a novel sample-adaptive product quantizer (SAPQ)","sourcePdf":"00796371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043865S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"796371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":796373,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We then use this information theoretic result to obtain depth lower bounds in the noisy circuit model of computation defined by von Neumann. In this model, each component fails (produces 1 instead of 0 or vice-versa) independently with a fixed probability, and yet the output of the circuit is required to be correct with high probability. Von Neumann showed how to construct circuits in this model that reliably compute a function and are no more than a constant factor deeper than noiseless circuits for the function. We provide a lower bound on the multiplicative increase in circuit depth necessary for reliable computation, and an upper bound on the maximum level of noise at which reliable computation is possible.","doi":"10.1109/18.796377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796377.pdf","startPage":"2367","endPage":"2373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal propagation and noisy circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796377/","displayDocTitle":"Signal propagation and noisy circuits","volume":"45","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418558","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal propagation and noisy circuits","sourcePdf":"00796377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027151S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"50","articleId":"796377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":796380,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

These schemes have tightly bounded peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) and simultaneously have good error correction capability. The key theoretical result is a previously unrecognized connection between Golay complementary sequences and second-order Reed-Muller codes over alphabets Z/sub 2/h. We obtain additional flexibility in trading off code rate, PMEPR, and error correction capability by partitioning the second-order Reed-Muller code into cosets such that codewords with large values of PMEPR are isolated. For all the proposed schemes we show that encoding is straightforward and give an efficient decoding algorithm involving multiple fast Hadamard transforms. Since the coding schemes are all based on the same formal generator matrix we can deal adaptively with varying channel constraints and evolving system requirements.","doi":"10.1109/18.796380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796380.pdf","startPage":"2397","endPage":"2417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-mean power control in OFDM, Golay complementary sequences, and Reed-Muller codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-mean power control in OFDM, Golay complementary sequences, and Reed-Muller codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796380/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6418561","volume":"45","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-mean power control in OFDM, Golay complementary sequences, and Reed-Muller codes","sourcePdf":"00796380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066247S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"627","articleId":"796380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":796381,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Three multirate access schemes are considered: multicode (MC) access where high-rate users multiplex their data bits onto multiple codes and form a single-rate system; variable spreading length (VSL) access where the spreading lengths of signature sequences are inversely proportional to users' data rates; and variable chipping rate (VCR) access where the chipping rates of the signature sequences are proportional to users' data rates. In order to remove the influence of signature sequences in the comparison of the three schemes, random signature sequences are assumed. Optimum mar-far resistance is then averaged over all possible realizations. Two types of code sets are considered for the VSL system: general random codes and random repetition codes. Bounds and approximations are provided for the average optimum near-far resistance. Analytical results show that the performance depends on the access schemes and the data rate of the users. The results for the VSL scheme with general random codes are extended for performance evaluation of systems with signature sequences which span many symbol intervals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum near-far resistance for dual-rate DS/CDMA signals: random signature sequence analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.796382","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796382.pdf","startPage":"2434","endPage":"2447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Optimum near-far resistance for dual-rate DS/CDMA signals: random signature sequence analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418563","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum near-far resistance for dual-rate DS/CDMA signals: random signature sequence analysis","sourcePdf":"00796382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037177S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","articleId":"796382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":796383,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

Both tests are multihypothesis versions of the binary sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and are referred to as MSPRTs. The first test is motivated by Bayesian optimality arguments, while the second corresponds to a generalized likelihood ratio test. It is shown that both MSPRTs are asymptotically optimal relative not only to the expected sample size but also to any positive moment of the stopping time distribution, when the error probabilities or, more generally, risks associated with incorrect decisions are small. The results are first derived for the discrete-time case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations and simple hypotheses. They are then extended to general, possibly continuous-time, statistical models that may include correlated and nonhomogeneous observation processes. It also demonstrated that the results can be extended to hypothesis testing problems with nuisance parameters, where the composite hypotheses, due to nuisance parameters, can be reduced to simple ones by using the principle of invariance. These results provide a complete generalization of the results given by Veeravalli and Baum (see ibid., vol.41, p.1994-97, 1995), where it was shown that the quasi-Bayesian MSPRT is asymptotically efficient with respect to the expected sample size for i.i.d. observations.","doi":"10.1109/18.796383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","startPage":"2448","endPage":"2461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihypothesis sequential probability ratio tests .I.

However, administrative diversity makes it impractical to monitor every link on an end-to-end path. At the same time, it is difficult to determine the performance characteristics of individual links from end-to-end measurements of unicast traffic. In this paper, we introduce the use of end-to-end measurements of multicast traffic to infer network-internal characteristics. The bandwidth efficiency of multicast traffic makes it suitable for large-scale measurements of both end-to-end and internal network dynamics. We develop a maximum-likelihood estimator for loss rates on internal links based on losses observed by multicast receivers. It exploits the inherent correlation between such observations to infer the performance of paths between branch points in the tree spanning a multicast source and its receivers. We derive its rate of convergence as the number of measurements increases, and we establish robustness with respect to certain generalizations of the underlying model.

We focus on the ubiquitous inner differential encoder (used, in particular, to resolve phase ambiguities), double differential encoder (used to resolve both phase and frequency ambiguities), and another rate 1 recursive convolutional code of memory 2. We substantiate analytically the rather surprising result, that the error probabilities corresponding to a maximum-likelihood (ML) coherently detected antipodal modulation over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel for this construction are advantageous as compared to the stand-alone outer convolutional code. This is in spite of the fact that the inner code is of rate 1. The analysis is based on the tangential sphere upper bound of an ML decoder, incorporating the ensemble weight distribution (WD) of the concatenated code, where the ensemble is generated by all random and uniform interleavers. This surprising result is attributed to the WD thinning observed for the concatenated scheme which shapes the WD of the outer convolutional code to resemble more closely the binomial distribution (typical of a fully random code of the same length and rate). This gain is maintained regardless of a rather dramatic decrease, as demonstrated here, in the minimum distance of the concatenated scheme as compared to the minimum distance of the outer stand-alone convolutional code. The advantage of the examined serially interleaved concatenated code, given in terms of bit and/or block error probability which is decoded by a practical suboptimal decoder, over the optimally decoded standard convolutional code is demonstrated by simulations, and some insights into the performance of the iterative decoding algorithm are also discussed. Though we have investigated only specific constructions of constituent inner (rate 1) and outer codes, we trust, hinging on the rational of the arguments here, that these results extend to many other constituent convolutional outer codes and rate 1 inner recursive convolutional codes.","doi":"10.1109/18.796409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17296/00796409.pdf","startPage":"2572","endPage":"2582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.796409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On interleaved, differentially encoded convolutional codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"On interleaved, differentially encoded convolutional codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796409/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6418590","volume":"45","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On interleaved, differentially encoded convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"00796409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064481S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","articleId":"796409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":796410,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

The SMF methodology involves designing filters by imposing a deterministic constraint on the output error sequence. A set-membership decision feedback equalizer (SM-DFE) for equalization of a communications channel is derived, and connections with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) DFE are established. Further, an adaptive solution to the general SMF problem via a novel optimal bounding ellipsoid (OBE) algorithm called BEACON is presented. This algorithm features sparse updating, wherein it uses about 5-10% of the data to update the parameter estimates without any loss in mean-squared error performance, in comparison with the conventional recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. It is shown that the BEACON algorithm can also be derived as a solution to a certain constrained least-squares problem. Simulation results are presented for various adaptive signal processing examples, including estimation of a real communication channel. Further, it is shown that the algorithm can accurately track fast time variations in a nonstationary environment. This improvement is a result of incorporating an explicit test to check if an update is needed at every time instant as well as an optimal data-dependent assignment to the updating weights whenever an update is required.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17297/00796429.pdf","startPage":"2928","endPage":"2941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.796429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.796429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEACON: an adaptive set-membership filtering technique with sparse updates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering","Signal processing algorithms","Decision feedback equalizers","Communication channels","Design methodology","Mean square error methods","Ellipsoids","Parameter estimation","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","adaptive equalisers","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BEACON","adaptive set-membership filtering technique","sparse updates","SMF problem","deterministic constraint","output error sequence","set-membership decision feedback equalizer","SM-DFE","equalization","communications channel","minimum mean square error DFE","MMSE DFE","optimal bounding ellipsoid","OBE algorithm","parameter estimates","mean-squared error performance","constrained least-squares problem","adaptive signal processing","fast time variations","nonstationary environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"BEACON: an adaptive set-membership filtering technique with sparse updates","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420333","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEACON: an adaptive set-membership filtering technique with sparse updates","sourcePdf":"00796429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035032S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"87","articleId":"796429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":796431,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

These QTFRs satisfy a scale covariance property that is equal to the scale covariance property satisfied by the continuous wavelet transform and a covariance property with respect to generalized time shifts. We derive an existence/representation theorem that shows the exceptional role of time shifts corresponding to group delay functions that are proportional to powers of frequency. This motivates the definition of the power classes (PCs) of QTFR's. The PCs contain the affine QTFR class as a special case, and thus, they extend the affine class. We show that the PCs can be defined axiomatically by the two covariance properties they satisfy, or they can be obtained from the affine class through a warping transformation. We discuss signal transformations related to the PCs, the description of the PCs by kernel functions, desirable properties and kernel constraints, and specific PC members. Furthermore, we consider three important PC subclasses, one of which contains the Bertrand (1992) P/sub k/ distributions. Finally, we comment on the discrete-time implementation of PC QTFRs, and we present simulation results that demonstrate the potential advantage of PC QTFRs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17297/00796440.pdf","startPage":"3067","endPage":"3083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.796440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.796440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The power classes-quadratic time-frequency representations with scale covariance and dispersive time-shift covariance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Dispersion","Signal analysis","Delay effects","Kernel","Performance analysis","Continuous wavelet transforms","Wavelet transforms","Signal resolution","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","signal representation","covariance analysis","delays","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power classes","quadratic time-frequency representations","scale covariance","dispersive time-shift covariance","signal analysis","dispersive systems","continuous wavelet transform","generalized time shifts","existence/representation theorem","group delay functions","affine QTFR class","covariance properties","warping transformation","signal transformations","kernel functions","kernel constraints","discrete-time implementation","Bertrand P/sub k/ distributions","simulation results","subclasses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"The power classes-quadratic time-frequency representations with scale covariance and dispersive time-shift covariance","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420344","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The power classes-quadratic time-frequency representations with scale covariance and dispersive time-shift covariance","sourcePdf":"00796440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050276S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","articleId":"796440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":796442,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For a uniform linear array, using common sense arguments, a small set of significant features of the covariance matrix are used as inputs to a neural net. The nonlinear transfer function of the neural net is adjusted by supervised training to provide the discriminant functions for order selection in its outputs. Results from the net are then compared with conventional criteria and demonstrate superior performance, in particular, for correlated sources and small sample sizes. Training may be introduced for known nonwhite noise, which serves to maintain high performance for reasonable correlation lengths.","doi":"10.1109/78.796443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17297/00796443.pdf","startPage":"3108","endPage":"3115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.796443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of the number of signals from features of the covariance matrix: a supervised approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=796443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796443/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the number of signals from features of the covariance matrix: a supervised approach","volume":"47","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420347","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the number of signals from features of the covariance matrix: a supervised approach","sourcePdf":"00796443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034173S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","articleId":"796443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":796446,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We first derive the relevant Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for arbitrary array configurations and specialize to uniform linear arrays.

Decreasing the size of a neural network is a way to avoid overfitting and bad generalization and leads moreover to simpler models which are required for real time applications, particularly in control. A learning algorithm and a pruning method both based on criteria robust to outliers are presented. Their performances are illustrated on a real example, the inverse model identification of a maglev system, which is nonlinear, dynamical and fast. This inverse model is used in a feedforward neural control scheme. Very satisfactory approximation performances are obtained for a network with very few parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1999.796627","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control Intelligent Systems and Semiotics (Cat.

Another effort is on the unsupervised learning scheme, which is based on a Lyapunov index function. Adaptive dynamic control is implemented by means of the self-organizing CMAC neural network, and it can identify the unmodelled dynamics of a plant and ensures asymptotic system stability in a Lyapunov sense.

A defect recognition method for foundry pieces in this field is proposed. The system classifies the pieces and selects the apt ones, which will later be machined within the automobile industry. The inspection of the pieces is carried out applying ultrasonic sensing. Due to the ultrasound properties, this type of vision is very appropriate for industrial environments. Starting from the signal reflected from the pieces, the treatment of the data is approached in two significant steps. First, the discrete wavelet transform, DWT, is applied to the analysis of ultrasonic waves for feature extraction. Second, a neural network is used to carry out the discrimination of the foundry pieces. This automated signal classification system obtains great results and the use of the tandem DWT analysis-neural network is shown to be a powerful technique for this type of application.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1999.796684","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control Intelligent Systems and Semiotics (Cat.

In the second approach, the fuzzy system is a convex combination of multiple affine models, where the control is a convex combination of multiple controllers.

The new sequence set offers good mean-square cross-correlation (MSCC) properties in both even and odd correlation functions, which are important for system capacity, acquisition and demodulation performance in DS-CDMA systems. A new asynchronous phase-coded DS-CDMA system model is proposed. An analysis of the new system model is presented, and a new aperiodic cross correlation function is derived. The correlation properties of the new sequence set are presented and compared with those of the conventional PN sequence sets. Emphasis is placed on the average rather than the worst case performance. Numerical results show that MSCC value of the new sequence set is only about half of those of the conventional PN sequence sets. This may result in an improvement of 3 dB in the multiple access interference (MAI) performance.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796706","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

This offset is corrected after the DS-SS signal is acquired. This paper considers the effect of frequency offset on the acquisition performance of DS-SS systems in frequency non-selective fading channels. A rapid acquisition system employing sliding correlation (matched filter) is utilized. To combat the effect of frequency offset, the total length of the sliding correlator is divided into shorter sections. We derive analytical expression for the probability of detection when the fading process is constant across all the sections. This is the case in most practical channels. The squared magnitude of the correlation results of each section are added (which we denote as non-coherent combining). The effect of frequency offset on the the probability of detection, probability of false alarm and the mean acquisition time are analyzed, allowing the trade-off between coherent and non-coherent correlation to me optimized.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796707","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Digital RF transmitters in portable devices consume energy only when high bits are sent and virtually no energy is consumed when low bits are sent. Therefore, energy consumption can be minimized by devising a source coding algorithm that minimizes the occurrence of high bits in transmitting information. In this paper, we first formulate the minimum energy source coding problem for RF transmission. We then derive the optimal memoryless coding algorithm from the source statistics. Finally, we improve the memoryless coding performance via a novel technique that utilizes a simple memory mechanism.

Using the postulated model, we derive the improvement to battery lifetime that results from pulsed current discharge driven by bursty stochastic transmissions. The results emphasize the role of traffic shaping in the quest to enhance battery behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6529009","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A model for battery pulsed discharge with recovery effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for battery pulsed discharge with recovery effect","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00796721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03151S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459","citationCount":"38","articleId":"796721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":796723,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Hongming","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Hongming","id":"37540980500"},{"name":"Bi Guangguo","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Bi Guangguo","id":"37297953300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5668-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1525-3511"}],"articleNumber":"796723","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Cellular networks","Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Adaptive arrays","Fading","Broadband antennas","System performance","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","adaptive antenna arrays","receiving antennas","radio receivers","fading channels","phase shift keying","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","cellular CDMA network","smart antenna receiver","uplink","reception","frequency-selective fading channel","asynchronous cellular CDMA system","BPSK modulation","RAKE combination","closed-form case","average error-probability","BER","user number"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the performance of the uplink in the cellular CDMA network, based on the reception of a smart antenna, is analyzed in the frequency-selective fading channel.

The roles of the two major performance affecting design factors, i.e., the direction selectivity of an array antenna and the direction-of-arrival (DOA) precision in the BF algorithm, are investigated not only in view of the SINR itself but also in view of the BF algorithm's robustness to the erroneous factors of spatial scattering of radio waves and DOA error. It is confirmed from this study that there exists trade-off characteristics between the SINR and the robustness with respect to the two design factors. The trade-off characteristics can be capitalized to obtain an economic means of BF implementation for cellular CDMA system which does not severely deteriorate SINR performance while ensuring its robustness to the erroneous factors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the SINR behavior of the beamforming-applied cellular CDMA base station receiver","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Powerful and generic data-aided (DA) estimators are needed to accommodate operation in the required modes. A simplified DA maximum likelihood (ML) joint estimator for carrier phase and symbol timing offset for QPSK/OQPSK burst modems and a sample systolic VLSI implementation for the estimator are presented. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for DA case is investigated. The performance of the estimator is shown through simulation to meet the CRLB even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Compared with theoretical solutions, the proposed estimator is less computationally intensive and is therefore easier to implement using current VLSI technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

In case obstacles are detected by sonar sensors, an autonomous mobile robot avoids collision with obstacles by wall following algorithm. They propose a simple making method to avoid being trapped in a local minima which was a serious problem in local path planning.

The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the example of parameter identification of the PUMA 560 robot (for second and third links).

For a system with K total asynchronous users and an observation of 2L+1 bits, the optimum detector is reviewed and shown to have complexity on the order of 2/sup K(2L+1)/. Taking advantage of the structure of the IS-95 downlink, we develop a reduced complexity optimum detector with exponentially lower complexity. In typical scenarios with two or three base stations, the reduced complexity optimum detector is significantly less complex than the brute-force optimum detector. We also consider a suboptimum, low complexity IS-95 downlink eavesdropping detector with connections to reduced complexity optimum detection as well as group detection and parallel interference cancellation.

Moreover, the detector need not know the number of interfering users, the size of their QAM alphabets, nor the amount of memory in the channel. The detector first transforms the channel into an equivalent higher-dimensional channel without memory by stacking a sufficient number of receiver observations. The three factors in a singular-value decomposition of the MMSE detector are then implemented one by one, with each factor being adapted blindly and independently.

A fast adaptation, a conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is used to find the optimum beamformer weights.

For in-beam multiple access interference reduction, a parallel interference canceller is used in each RAKE finger.

The moment generating function (MGF) of the signal power at the output of the SWC combiner and the first-order derivative of the MGF with respect to the switching threshold are derived. These expressions are obtained for the general case of correlated fading and nonidentical diversity branches, and hold for any common fading distributions (e.g., Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Rician, Nakagami-q). The optimum switching threshold (in a minimum error rate sense) is obtained by solving a nonlinear equation which is formed by using the first-order derivative of the MGF. This nonlinear equation can be simplified for several special cases: (a) closed-form expressions for the optimal switching threshold are derived for three generic forms of the conditional error probability by assuming independent and identically distributed diversity branches; and (b) a closed-form formula for the optimal switching threshold is derived for the non-coherent binary modulation formats in correlated Rayleigh or Nakagami-m fading with identical fading statistics.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796794","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

We consider the coherent detection of digital signals received over correlated Nakagami (1960) fading channels, where the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the diversity branches are not necessarily independent or identically distributed. Specifically: (1) these SNRs can be arbitrarily correlated; (2) the SNR distributions can be from different Nakagami families, i.e., fading parameters (ms) are not necessarily equal; and (3) the average SNRs (averaged over the fading) of the branches are not necessarily equal. We derive closed-form expressions for three performance measures of a MRC diversity system: (1) probability density function (p.d.f.) of the combiner output SNR; (2) symbol error probability (SEP) for coherent detection; and (3) outage probability. We obtain a canonical structure for these performance measures as a weighted sum of the corresponding expressions for a non-diversity (single-branch) system with appropriately-defined parameters. This result is fundamental: the canonical structure depends only on the properties of the channel and diversity combiner, and not on the specific modulation technique.

All such systems must guarantee efficient initial code acquisition at the mobile terminal, both for call start-up and for soft-handoff handling. To this end, a spread pilot tone is generally adopted. In this paper we compare two approaches for pilot design, namely the conventional continuous pilot (CP) and a burst pilot (BP) with fractional duty cycle. We trade-off the two solutions based on acquisition error probability P/sub e/, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), dwell time T/sub d/, and impact at system level. The main result is that for equal P/sub e/ and T/sub d/ the BP solution yields a considerable gain in requested SNR. However, CP can be forced to achieve the same P/sub e/ objective with the same SNR by allowing a longer T/sub d/, and its impact at system level is considerably milder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Burst vs. continuous pilot acquisition in wideband CDMA cellular mobile systems","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The most general bound is an upper bound obtained by adapting a well-known hound for the AWGN channel to the fading channel. A second simple approximated (lower) bound is also introduced to allow the construction of a very efficient estimator for frame and hit error probability. The efficiency of the proposed method with respect to the usual simulation is investigated and the results prove the possibility of an accurate and fast evaluation in the region of low error probabilities.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.1999.796843","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

In this situation, MRC-RAKE receivers with resolution reduction (RR) of the diversity branches may be used to significantly improve performance in the forward link of DS-CDMA systems (Yang 1995). As a result of the use of RR techniques, the noise components at the finger outputs are correlated. It has been shown that the MRC is suboptimal in the presence of correlated noise components. In this paper, a minimum mean squared error combiner (MMSEC) RAKE receiver with RR is proposed. The performance of the RAKE receiver with two branches is studied by means of theoretical analysis and computer simulations. To allow a simple practical implementation, a suboptimal structure of the MMSEC is also proposed. Frame error rate (FER) is obtained by using a simulation system based on the forward link of the digital cellular standard IS-95 in a typical indoor radio channel. Our results show that this new receiver scheme can achieve a gain of 3.6 dB over a conventional MRC-RAKE receiver at an FER of 0.01, with small increase in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796844","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Two new blind interference cancellation techniques suitable for the downlink of any CDMA system are proposed. The receivers are blind in the sense that no prior knowledge of users' spreading codes or even their spreading factors are required. The mobile receiver estimates the effective spreading codes of the interfering users regardless of their spreading factors using fast Walsh transform (FWT) correlators and uses these information to cancel out the intra-cell multi-user interference. The complexity of the proposed techniques is low compared to conventional interference cancellation techniques. Simulation results show a capacity increase of up to 50 % of the original (without IIC) system capacity or up to 10 dB signal to Gaussian noise ratio gain at a fixed capacity (the inter-cell interference is modeled as a Gaussian noise).","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Two types of decorrelators that employ the difference in processing gains have been proposed: a high-rate decorrelator (HRD) matched to the data rate of the high-rate users, and a low-rate decorrelator (LRD) matched to the data rate of the low-rate users. It has been observed that the LRD provides better performance than the HRD for all the users at the expense of higher complexity and longer demodulation delay for high-rate users. To improve the performance and reduce the demodulation delay, a decorrelating decision-feedback detector is proposed and its asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) is analyzed. Because of the high computational complexity in calculating the exact AME, both upper and lower bounds of the AME are developed. In some special cases, the complexity of these bounds is linear in the number of users. It is shown that this detector incurs little demodulation delay for high-rate users and provides better performance for low-rate users than that of the LRD when the powers of the interfering users are comparable to that of the desired user.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796848","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Specifically, given the user distribution in a cell, we investigate the two problems of how to appropriately sectorize the cell such that we minimize the total received power and the total transmit power spent by all the users, in both cases, while giving each user acceptable quality of service. The optimum arrangement equalizes the number of users in each sector for the received power optimization problem. The transmit power optimization can be formulated as a graph partitioning problem which can be solved in polynomial time. In both cases, the optimum arrangement can be quite different from uniform cell sectorization (equal partitioning) under non-uniform traffic conditions. We observe that, with adaptive sectorization, received and transmit power savings are achieved and the number of users served by the system (system capacity) is increased compared to uniform sectorization of the cell.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796879","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The information provided by these sensors, together with the pulse width modulation (PWM) information, is used to reconstruct the motor phase currents. After a description of the two methods and the limitations they present, an application in case of an induction motor drive is illustrated in which the adjacent vector-space vector pulse width modulation (AV-SVPWM) technique is used to drive the inverter. Some aspects involving the non ideal behaviour of different parts of the system (presence of dead time, power switches driver delay, rise and settling time of the current, A/D conversion module sampling time) are investigated in details and the specific hardware implementation is discussed. Experimental results and comparisons between the two methods are presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1999.796888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17272","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1289 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"ISIE '99.

The former significantly reduces most of the multiple access interference (MAI) while the latter provides very strong error correcting capability against residual interference and background noise. As both interference cancellation and turbo decoding are iterative multi-stage algorithms, we combine the two multi-stage algorithms into an integrated interference cancellation and decoding algorithm in which each stage consists of a interference cancellation iteration and a turbo decoding iteration. The performance of this integrated approach is compared to the usual concatenation approach where all the multi-stage interference cancellation iterations are completed first before starting the turbo decoding iterations. Even though both approaches have the same amount of complexity, we find that significant performance gain is achieved when the iterations are integrated and this performance gain increases with the number of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Analytical models usually suffer from many simplifying approximations and presumed uniformity of traffic conditions. On the other hand, event driven simulators are time consuming both in the software development and numerical study phases, especially when a multi-cell environment is considered. In this paper we describe a model which combines some advantages of the two approaches. In particular it can provide results in time comparable with analytical models while taking into account interdependencies between the connection parameters the same way as in the simulation model. The model can be compared to capacity evaluation at a given time instant in a simulation model but with a statistical representation of the mobiles. Hence the name statistical snap-shot. In the paper we analyze the main features of the model. Numerical results obtained from the analytic model are found to be within 10% of the results obtained from a detailed simulation study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical \"snap-shot\" for multi-cell CDMA system capacity analysis","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The scheme is applied to a wireless network using an adaptive resource allocation framework. A multimedia connection is represented in terms of three substreams (video, audio and data) each with a pre-specified range of acceptable quality of service (QoS) requirements. This range of requirements make the application adaptive in the sense that each of its substreams specify to the network a number of acceptable QoS levels instead of just a single one. For example, MPEG-based video can be transmitted at different levels of varying qualities. As resource availability in the wireless network changes, the control scheme selects the best possible QoS level that each substream can obtain for a certain period of time. In case of congestion, the control scheme attempts to free up some wireless resources by degrading the QoS of existing calls to a lesser level in order to accommodate new calls. This is done, however, under the constraint of achieving maximum utilization of the resources; and sharing them fairly among the calls. The degradation in the QoS is limited to a minimum value for each multimedia substream defined in a user-defined profile. From the user perspective, the perception of the QoS degradation is very graceful and happens only during over-load periods. The network services, on the other hand, are greatly enhanced due to the fact that the call blocking probability is significantly decreased. Genetic algorithms have been used to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results for a wireless ATM network demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of increasing the number of calls admitted while effectively utilizing the available bandwidth fairly among the calls.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796936","pdfPath":"/iel5/6459/17271/00796936.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1247 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

CATA allows nodes to contend for and reserve time slots by means of a distributed reservation and handshake mechanism. Contention is limited among nodes within two hops of one another, which provides a very efficient spatial reuse of the bandwidth available. CATA ensures that no collisions occur in successfully reserved time slots, even when hidden terminals exist. Reservations in CATA support unicasting, multicasting and broadcasting simultaneously, and adapt to dynamic service time. The throughput achieved by CATA is analyzed for the case of a fully-connected network topology. Numerical results show that CATA can achieve very high throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/796954/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6536596","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"21-24 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A protocol for topology-dependent transmission scheduling in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A protocol for topology-dependent transmission scheduling in wireless networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00796954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049516S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6459","citationCount":"73","articleId":"796954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":796955,"authors":[{"name":"W.W.S.

That is, the proposed mechanism uses the competition mechanism for the transmission of first radio frame and utilizes the reservation mechanism for the transmission of other following continuous radio frame. According to the performance analysis, the proposed mechanism has better performance than slotted-ALOHA because of using contention and reservation in the case where signal and data messages are transmitted.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The receiver performs two successive soft-output decisions, achieved by a soft-input soft-output (SISO) multiuser detector and a bank of single-user SISO channel decoders, through an iterative process. At each iteration, extrinsic information is extracted from detection and decoding stages and is then used as a priori information in the next iteration, just as in turbo decoding. A low-complexity SISO multiuser detector is developed based on a novel nonlinear interference suppression technique, which makes use of both soft-interference cancellation and instantaneous linear MMSE filtering. Turbo multiuser detectors for both the simple synchronous CDMA channels and the more complex asynchronous multipath CDMA channels are developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The space-time-transmit-diversity (STTD) method is an open loop transmit diversity scheme, i.e. it does not require any knowledge of the channel at the transmitter. Simulations have shown that the STTD scheme significantly outperforms the case where no antenna diversity is used. In fact, it even outperforms the non-diversity (ND) case even when soft handoff is used. STTD exploits the extra path diversity afforded by the second antennas and therefore outperforms two other open loop transmit antenna diversity techniques, viz. the orthogonal transmit diversity (OTD) and the time switched time diversity (TSTD). These techniques use multiple transmit antennas to provide some interleaver time diversity against fading, particularly at low Doppler rates and when the mobile receiver does not have enough paths at the RAKE receiver. STTD has the added advantages of being a power amplifier (PA) balanced technique, is easily backward compatible with ND systems and does not need careful interleaver design.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Unlike current standards, such as IS-95, these new systems will transmit both voice and data information at much higher rates than currently offered today. To support these high data rates, the new wideband CDMA systems (WCDMA and cdma2000) will make use of shorter user codes and more aggressive power control schemes. As a consequence, the multiuser interference at the receiver will be strongly non-Gaussian and thus degrade the performance of the standard receiver. To combat this, we present a novel \"type-based\" receiver which outperforms the current industrial gold standard (RAKE receiver) in most reasonable operational scenarios. This type-based receiver is asymptotically optimal with respect to any form of multiuser interference and any form of background noise, mimics the performance of multiuser detectors without having to know the interfering users' chip sequences, doesn't suffer from the \"near-far\" problem, and matches the computational complexity of the RAKE receiver. These properties make this new receiver ideally suited for both indoor and outdoor CDMA based cellular systems operating in interference limited, multipath environments.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.796982","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Conventional routing does not scale well to network size. Likewise, conventional hierarchical routing cannot handle mobility efficiently. We propose a novel soft state wireless hierarchical routing protocol-Hierarchical State Routing (HSR). We distinguish between the \"physical\" routing hierarchy (dictated by geographical relationships between nodes) and \"logical\" hierarchy of subnets in which the members move as a group (e.g., company, brigade, battalion in the battlefield). HSR keeps track of logical subnet movements using home agent concepts akin to Mobile IP.

Programmable logic can provide increased DSP system performance at reduced system cost. Programmable logic combines the flexibility of a general purpose DSP plus the speed, density, and low cost of an ASIC implementation. In some applications, programmable logic replaces the DSP processor entirely. In others, programmable logic works in conjunction with the DSP processor, offloading the computationally-intensive function and freeing the processor for other functions. This paper describes an alternative to traditional, general-purpose DSP processors. Programmable logic can implement functions beyond the capabilities of today's DSP processors. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) potentially provide performance increases of an order of magnitude over traditional DSPs with the same flexibility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP acceleration using a reconfigurable FPGA","publicationTitle":"ISIE '99.

A completely satisfactory solution has not yet been obtained due to conflicting requirements of accommodating complex variable bit rate traffic and supporting real time call admission and congestion control mechanism. The shift register traffic shaper (SRTS) scheme proposed by Radhakrishnan, Raghavan and Agrawala (see Comp. Net. & ISDN systems, Elsevier, vol. 28, p.453-69, 1996) performs better than LB mechanism by incorporating multiple windows accommodating different degrees of burstiness in the traffic. However the parameters of the SRTS scheme is insensitive to the congestion level at the ATM node. In this paper a two pronged approach is suggested and studied to combat congestion. The ANN monitors the congestion level at the ATM node and generates the control signals to the sources. The SRTS scheme modifies its parameters in response to this signal to keep the congestion under control. Depending upon the control signal received, the SRTS minimizes the congestion by either splitting the sources contending for network access into groups or by modifying the window parameters of individual SRTS. To validate these approaches an ANN is simulated and the optimum weight vector is obtained. An ATM node with traffic from sources with SRTS is simulated and the loss probability is obtained under different output burstiness. The results obtained confirms the effectiveness of staggering and modification of parameters of SRTS.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1998.797059","startPage":"33","endPage":"36 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE TENCON '98.

When a full search (FS) block matching algorithm (BMA) is used for estimating motion vectors, it requires very heavy computational complexity. Although several fast block matching algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, those methods sacrifice their reconstructed image qualities. We propose a new motion estimation algorithm by considering matching criteria and statistical properties of object displacement. We exploit the relationship between the motion and frame difference of each block to choose a more compact search pattern for BMA. By changing the search pattern adaptively, we can improve motion prediction, while reducing computational complexity than other fast BMA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1998.797097","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE TENCON '98.

A very important method of this type is the simulation of complex communication systems, such as mobile radio systems. Although sophisticated simulation tools offer the advantage of rather cost efficient investigations compared to measurements with real-time experimental hardware setups, simulations are still connected with an enormous expense of time. This is mainly due to the fact that the existing simulation tools model the entire system behaviour in a straight forward approach without taking advantage of the structural properties of the system which allow a reduction of the simulation expense. In the present paper, a novel simulation concept of reduced computational cost is presented for a TD-CDMA mobile radio system with adaptive antennas. TD-CDMA forms part of the third generation mobile radio standard for UMTS adopted by the ETSI and is one of the candidates considered by ITU for IMT-2000. The novel simulation concept and the simulation concept applied up to now are compared with regard to the computational complexity and accuracy through simulations in the uplink of TD-CDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Different from previous works, the proposed method uses the dependency that exists between the respective signal qualities of the pilot channel and traffic channels. Since present CDMA forward link exploits coherent demodulation with continuously transmitting pilot signals, the stronger the pilot channel is, the less traffic power may be required while the same transmission quality is maintained. With laboratory tests, the dependency is graphed. And then an optimal pilot signal quality is found, which minimizes the total transmit power. Considering various mobile environments, -10 dB is an outstanding choice for the pilot signal quality. This solution can be directly applied to maximize the capacity of CDMA cellular and PCS systems or improve the service quality at the cell edge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation in CDMA forward link using dependency between pilot and traffic channels","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Based on this observation, the crest-factor distributions of BPSK MC-CDMA using two different binary orthogonal spreading sequences namely Walsh codes and orthogonal Gold codes-as well as two polyphase orthogonal sequences-Frank codes and Zadoff-Chu (1972) codes-are compared against that of BPSK OFDM. In a 'lightly loaded' system the polyphase sequences and the orthogonal Gold codes are shown to have better CF distributions. However, in a 'fully loaded' system, Walsh codes exhibit the best crest-factor distribution amongst the investigated codes. MC-CDMA using Walsh codes was found to exhibit a peak factor reduction of 1.5 over OFDM, when the number of subcarriers is 16 and a rate 15/16 CF reduction block code is used, while maintaining the same spectral efficiency. We found that Zadoff-Chu spread MC-CDMA showed the best BER performance amongst the considered systems in Rayleigh channels, when joint-detection was employed, despite its heavier clipping than that of the Walsh spread scheme. This is due to its low multiple user interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crest-factor study of MC-CDMA and OFDM","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

System throughput of an OFDM system can be enhanced by using link adaptation; the best set of modulation scheme and FEC coding rate is dynamically selected to achieve the target packet error rate (PER) before ARQ. An important practical issue in applying link adaptation is how to estimate the link quality precisely. Link quality is well assessed by carrier/noise ratio (CNR) and the delay spread. Two link quality estimation functions are introduced; one examines the correlation between subcarriers while the another considers CNR. Both are simple to implement in combination with the frequency-domain initial equalizer. Simulation results verify that the proposed link adaptation scheme is effective in improving system throughput in a practical manner.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The channel estimation method is based on a decision-directed adaptive technique that uses decisions at the output of either the detector (uncoded mode) or the decoder (coded mode). The main aim is to investigate the effect of using a time-domain predictor on the performance of the channel estimator and to compare its impact on both the coded and uncoded estimator modes. It is found that the predictor significantly improves the estimator's performance, especially when the channel changes rapidly between consecutive OFDM symbols. It is also found that the performance of both the coded and uncoded estimator modes converge for SNR>15 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

In this article we analyse linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimators to reduce the noise due to ICI and propose two channel estimation schemes which perform interpolation of the noise-reduced pilot tones in the time-direction prior to frequency interpolation.

Nevertheless, the delayed waves existing in a symbol degrade the transmission performance at the receiver. Therefore when the OFDM transmission system applies to a mobile radio communication system, we have to remove the influence without intricacy. This paper proposes a new scheme in order to estimate the propagation characteristics using the characteristics of the distinctive OFDM signal which is a periodically inserted pilot signal in the frequency axis before IFFT at the transmitter. Moreover, we introduce a cancellation scheme of delayed waves on the basis of the proposed estimation technique. Using these schemes, it is possible to estimate and cancel the interference of the delayed wave before FFT at the receiver. In this paper, moreover, we evaluate the estimation accuracy of the proposed estimation method and the BER performance of the proposed system under fast multipath fading environment by computer simulation. Especially, in this simulation, we utilize the evaluation format of OFDM discussed in the Multimedia Mobile Access Communication Systems Promotion Council (MMAC).","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This is important, since channel variations during one OFDM symbol cause inter sub-carrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems, which degrades the performance, since ICI can be seen as additional near-Gaussian noise. The analysis is outlined, and closed-form results given for numerous important practical Doppler spread encountered in mobile channels. We also show that for the case of asymmetrical Doppler spreads, the frequency correction of the receiver can be adjusted so as to minimize the ICI. To extend our work to OFDM(A) mobile radio systems in the uplink case where many users' contributions to the ICI overlap, we have introduced the concept of an equivalent single-user which causes the total ICI, in order to use the same analytical framework. For some channel examples, we simulated the Doppler spread of this equivalent user. Simulation results confirm our analysis and show the importance of the analytical tool to perform realistic system analysis without having to resort to time consuming time-domain simulations.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.1999.797150","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

We formulate the position-based transmit assignment problem and propose a sub-optimal heuristic solution. Improvement in throughput and its trade-off with fairness among users in different regions is discussed.

High data rate connections can be supported in WCDMA systems by employing low spreading factors while maintaining fixed bandwidth. Multiple access interference (MAI) that a high data rate user experiences can be considered low, and with lowest spreading factors inter-path interference (IPI) becomes the limiting factor for the performance of the conventional RAKE receiver. In this paper, linear receivers capable of suppressing inter-path interference in WCDMA downlink are discussed, and their performance is evaluated in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel. The very promising chip equalizer receivers, which equalize the multipath channel prior to despreading, are included in the discussion with the RAKE and 'standard' LMMSE receivers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The recently proposed method by Tsatsanis et al. (1997) corresponds to unbiased MMSE equalization. We interpret this approach in terms of two-sided linear prediction (TSLP), also called smoothing by Tong (1998). We establish the links between MMSE, minimum output energy (MOE) and MMSE ZF and we prove equivalence under the unbiasedness constraint and/or in the noiseless case. Our analysis shows how to properly apply Capon's principle for linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming to blind multichannel equalization. Furthermore, we show that Tsatsanis's application of Capon's principle becomes only correct, and Tong's channel estimate becomes only unbiased, at high SNR. Whereas Capon dictates to do MMSE ZF, it is easier but equivalent to approach the problem via unbiased MMSE (UMMSE) on noiseless data. Hence, the covariance matrix of the received signal has to be \"denoised\" before using it in the blind estimation method. We provide a denoising approach without eigen decomposition that gives excellent performance. Furthermore, we present a simple and efficient procedure to simultaneously detect the channel order. Simulation results are presented to support our claims.","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall. IEEE VTS 50th Vehicular Technology Conference (Cat.

The RAKE receiver has multiple demodulators, called fingers, which can be used to demodulate distinct multipath components in parallel making it possible to implement diversity reception in the handsets. Typical analyses of the performance of CDMA handsets assume these multipath components to be separated from each other by at least a chip duration which lends a white noise like appearance to multipath interference. In this paper, we present a model to study the performance of a RAKE receiver whose fingers can be assigned to fractionally spaced (i.e., separated by less than a chip duration) multipath components. Based on simulation results, we propose a finger assignment strategy to obtain the best performance under a complexity constraint limiting the number of RAKE receiver fingers available for demodulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAKE receiver finger assignment in CDMA terminals with fractionally spaced multipaths","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The second is based on iterative schemes such as the method of conjugate gradients or the Jacobi algorithm and its derivatives.

Over-sampling w.r.t. the chip rate is applied to the cyclostationary received signal and multi-sensor reception is considered, leading to a linear multichannel model. Channels for different users are considered to be FIR and of possibly different lengths, depending upon their processing gains. We consider an individualized linear MMSE-ZF or projection receiver for a given user, exploiting its spreading sequence and timing information. Due to the periodically varying nature of the symbol spreading sequences for fast users in a multirate setup, the symbol rate cyclostationarity no longer holds for all users. However, the multiuser signal is still cyclostationary with the period P, where P is the processing gain at the slowest rate. A u/sub k/ times faster user k behaves as if it were a linear combination of u/sub k/ users at the slowest rate. The problem boils down to classical multiuser detection with time-varying interference cancelling filters for faster users. The processing is time-invariant, however, when performed at rate P. In that case, u/sub k/ symbols for the kth user get estimated simultaneously through u/sub k/ parallel receivers. We discuss the blind estimation of the channels, required for determining the linear multirate receivers, via a constrained minimum output energy approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE-ZF receiver and blind adaptation for multirate CDMA","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In order to scale the boosted word-line voltage for reading memory data with low power supply, it is necessary to tighten the erased-Vth distribution. The self-convergence method has been proposed to tighten the Vth-distribution within 2 V. However, it's not available to tighten the width below 1 V due to the high power consumption and long converging time. Therefore, the bit-by-bit weak program after over-erase-verify is needed. This paper shows a problem of the bit-by-bit weak program and proposes a sampling method of weak program for a solution, which can achieve 0.5 V in the Vth-distribution width, resulting in lowering the word-line voltage for less than 1.5 V operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6505327","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1999","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sampling weak-program method to tighten Vth-distribution of 0.5 V for low-voltage flash memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sampling weak-program method to tighten Vth-distribution of 0.5 V for low-voltage flash memories","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00797226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048755S","chronDate":"17-19 June 1999","isNumber":"17302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6473","citationCount":"5","articleId":"797226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":797227,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In portable communication products, sub-1.8 V operation is essential. In view of the chip cost, a NAND-type cell has a big advantage over a NOR-type cell due to its smaller cell size. However, in this paper we show for the first time that the conventional NAND flash memory cannot operate below 2.0 V due to a program disturb issue. To solve this problem, we propose a new programming scheme which drastically reduces the program disturb and realizes highly reliable, high-speed programming, low voltage operation, low power consumption and low cost NAND flash memories.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1999.797227","publicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

In this work, new circuit design and layout methods are applied to a glitch-free 10 b DAC based on the pipelined charge redistribution architecture. Transients in the output current as codes change are called glitches, and because glitch characteristics depend nonlinearly on codes, they result in spurious tones in the output frequency spectrum. In the glitch-free DAC, on the other hand, the analog voltages are sampled and held at each clock cycle. The 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS prototype described here clocks at up to 400 MS/s, and delivers a superior spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) over the Nyquist band compared to other CMOS DACs. This circuit is part of a digitally based agile frequency synthesizer for a fast-frequency hopping wireless transmitter, and is intended to drive on-chip capacitor loads.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1999.797240","publicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

A ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), especially a chain FRAM, has great potential for future high-density nonvolatile memory. However, two severe problems inherent to ferroelectric material make it difficult to realize gigabit scale FRAMs; cell polarization decreases drastically in scaled FRAMs, 1) because the cell polarization does not increase by thinning the ferroelectric film, and 2) because the three-dimensional ferroelectric capacitor is difficult to make. Therefore, a sufficient cell signal will not be obtained in 256 Mb FRAMs and beyond. The gain cell approach shown can be a solution for this problem because a large cell signal is obtained even with small cell polarization due to small load capacitance. However, a memory cell using a ferroelectric FET has drawbacks such as fabrication difficulty, poor data retention and read/write disturb. A memory cell composed of a gain transistor, a write transistor, a ferroelectric capacitor and a load capacitor, realizes stable read/write operation. However the memory cell size is very large. The concept of a new gain cell block is proposed. The gain cell block contains two chain cell blocks and a gain unit composed of a gain transistor and a write transistor. The gain unit is shared by the two chain cell blocks. This configuration realizes both a large readout cell signal and a small average cell size.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1999.797251","publicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

Low power consumption of DRAMs is of great concern as handheld communication tools are widely used in various environments. The combination of Voltage-Down-Convertor (VDC) and Boosted Sense Ground (BSG) scheme meets the demand because it has advantages of: 1) reduction of voltage swing of bit-lines (BLs); 2) suppression of junction leakage current of memory cells because of needlessness of substrate bias; 3) decrease of subthreshold leakage current of memory cells because of negative gate-source voltage (Vgs) of an access transistor. It can lower the active current, extend the data retention time, and reduce the data retention current. The scheme, however, has some drawbacks. First, the smaller the voltage swing on BLs is, the slower the sense speed is. Second, BSG level (Vbsg) should be stable and tolerant of GND noise because the level difference between Vbsg and GND is small. This paper proposes a new scheme to solve these problems, called a Precharged-Capacitor-Assisted Sensing (PCAS) scheme. By adopting this scheme, proper voltage level on BLs can be generated stably with faster sense speed without losing the advantages of the conventional scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Voltage","Capacitors","Principal component analysis","Communication system control","Noise level","Parasitic capacitance","CMOS technology","Ultra large scale integration","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","DRAM chips","CMOS memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precharged-capacitor-assisted sensing scheme","level controller","low power DRAMs","memory cells","subthreshold leakage current","junction leakage current","dynamic RAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797258","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.1999.797258","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Circuits.

These shortcomings are essentially caused by the uplink multiplexing of the traffic channel, which is seen by the base station as a powerful interfering source coming from the direction of arrival of the desired user. In this paper, a semi-blind beamforming technique is proposed as a valid solution to overcome this effect.

For data services an increased link quality will directly translate into improved throughput. A well-known technique that improves link performance is antenna diversity. Antenna diversity also enables interference-cancellation methods, which are evaluated in this paper. The conclusion is that introducing interference rejection in a GSM/EDGE classic scenario could increase average user bit rate by 26%. In a TDMA/EDGE compact scenario the average bit rate increase could be as high as 46% due to the time synchronized structure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","GSM","Time division multiple access","Bit rate","Throughput","Standardization","Ground penetrating radar","Receiving antennas","Physical layer","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","diversity reception","cellular radio","time division multiple access","packet radio networks","data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancellation","antenna diversity","EDGE","GSM","TDMA/136","future wireless communication systems","high bit rates","packet data services","increased link quality","improved throughput","interference-cancellation methods","interference rejection","average user bit rate","TDMA/EDGE compact scenario","time synchronized structure","enhanced data rates","global evolution"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.1999.797279","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1960 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The optimization of ray-tracing makes it possible to take into account a great number of rays: reflected, diffracted and multiple combinations of these effects. This degree of precision in the calculation of the signal levels permits an accurate estimation not only of the signal mean level but also its statistics. The main feature of the method is the possibility of analyzing the radio channel in general enclosed spaces, including indoor, outdoor and mixed indoor/urban environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Using digital signal processing techniques and a time-domain approach, we can accurately predict the EVM and the ACPR related to the input power. The nonlinear effects of the MMIC PA are modeled as traditional nonlinearity parameters, such as 1-dB gain compression point or third-order intercept point IP3, by which the EVM and ACPR are simulated. A standard NADC modulated signal from a HP ESG-D signal generator is applied to the MMIC PA and the output signal analyzed by a HP 89410A vector signal analyzer.

Results from Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that the robustness of the scheme against multiple-access interference being achieved for floating-point arithmetic operation can be preserved for FIPA at the expense of an increased BER for low interference levels. For a given word length in the FIPA operation, a threshold effect in the BER is observed if overflow is not suppressed. The threshold depends on the relative interference level and the adopted overflow handling. In moderate near-far scenarios, the performance can be improved by reducing the total dynamic range and increasing the accuracy of the decision variable of the weak signal.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797295","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Their performance is verified for a mixed voice (connection-oriented) and packet data (connectionless) traffic. Simulation results for a multi-cell system under typical radio propagation and traffic conditions indicate that an algorithm allowing for queuing of both voice calls and data blocks (with the 100 msec maximum allowable delay for voice calls), as well as the system-imposed limited reduction on the requested data rate, is capable of ensuring relatively high system capacity at reasonable quality of service.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In this paper, a frame synchronization scheme for uplink MC-CDMA with asynchronous transmission is suggested. This technique uses a time domain signal which is produced when the spreading code of MC-CDMA is given in the frequency domain. The correlation of already known information, that is, IDFT of the spreading code and sampled received signal, becomes the metric of frame synchronization. In order to obtain good correlation characteristics in the time domain, a new spreading code scheme is suggested. The proposed scheme uses no other information than already known spreading code and does not need FFT operation. Also, the scheme performs well in multipath fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797326","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

In this paper we focus on a technique to improve the performance of the search mode. Received PN code periods are correlated with a local section of the PN code. Delays corresponding to high correlation results are verified in the verification mode. If the verification process is not successful a new received PN code period is correlated. In conventional techniques, the correlation results from previous code periods are erased. In this paper we propose a method where these correlation results are retained and a moving average of correlation results is performed. A considerable improvement in the performance of the acquisition system is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6520941","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Direct sequence spread spectrum acquisition with sample accumulation in fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct sequence spread spectrum acquisition with sample accumulation in fading channels","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00797328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076141S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454","articleId":"797328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":797329,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper we compare and analyze preambles for OFDM systems based on repeated OFDM data symbols or repeated short pseudonoise sequences (PN-sequences). We make an analytical evaluation for AWGN channels and simulate the performance in oneand two-tap Rayleigh fading channels. The PN-based preamble gives better detection properties in terms of lower false detection probability and lower probability of missing the synchronization signal. The PN-based preamble has low peak-to-average power ratio and it makes it possible to use an ADC with one-bit quantization in stand-by mode. For frequency offset estimation both preambles give similar performance, but the PN-based preamble allows for a greater reduction in stand-by mode power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

HNN-based DCA schemes have been studied over the recent years but these techniques are invariably centralised. Operation in a distributed environment necessitates certain system level requirements for accessing system-wide channel allocation information used by the algorithm. Distributed operation also suggests that the HNN-based DCA schemes operate autonomously and it would be of interest to evaluate how such schemes compare with the centralised schemes. The paper describes a suitable network architecture for a distributed HNN and highlights some of its key benefits through simulation.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797355","startPage":"2334","endPage":"2338 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In this paper, we present a simple channel equalization method (training symbol-based) for the MC-CDMA systems in multipath fading environments, and its performance is analyzed in the downlink case. It is shown that with the aid of guard intervals, the proposed equalizer has an acceptable performance, if the equalizer's parameters are chosen properly. This is also proved by the computer simulation results. It is found that the utilization of guard intervals is a unique advantage for multi-carrier systems, although it reduces the system efficiency in some sense.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797361","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The basic assumption of the paper is that the channel response exhibits fast changes. A second goal of the paper is to force the definition of a universal CDMA blind equalization scheme that is capable of performing for DS-CDMA or multi-carrier CDMA signal modulations without any modification in the equalizer. The formulation of the equalization scheme allows the consideration of temporal and/or spatial diversity front-end receivers. The result is a high-performance system that uses a deterministic blind criterion to equalize the channel, avoiding the use of stochastic methods. The proposed technique performs direct channel equalization without previous channel estimation. Although the proposed equalizer in this work performs equalization at chip rate, this paper suggests a solution to achieve equalization at lower rates.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.797362","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Firstly, the instantaneous power of the received baseband signal is calculated to remove the frequency offset and data/speech information-bearing signals, while keeping the Doppler frequency information. Secondly, the calculated power signal is filtered using a lowpass linear phase finite impulse response (FIR) filter to suppress interference and noise. Thirdly, the filtered power signal is decimated to ease the computational burden, while the decimation factor is properly chosen to avoid frequency aliasing. Fourthly, autocorrelation values of the decimated filtered power signals are calculated on shifting slot by slot to suppress the \"slot burst frequency\" interference. Fifthly, the calculated autocorrelation values are normalized to suppress the power fluctuation of the received signals. Finally, the normalized autocorrelation values are compared with thresholds to estimate mobile speed. The simulation results indicate that the new algorithm works very well for both non-dispersive channels and dispersive channels to distinguish fast and slow moving mobiles.

In this paper, we model parallel computation using parameterized task graphs which represent coarse-grain parallelism independent of the problem size.

It is proven that FLB is essentially equivalent to the existing ETF scheduling algorithm of O(W(E+V)P) time complexity.

In this field have emerged a great deal of algorithms and hierarchical structures to support the processing of this type of image.

This renders the more frequent operation of finding class identifiers very fast, while the less-frequent class-merging operation has a relatively high computational cost. Nonetheless, it is possible to reduce significantly the merging cost by two slight modifications to the algorithm's basic structure. The idea of merging equivalence classes is present also in Samet's general labeling algorithm. However when considering the case of binary images in raster format this algorithm is much more complex than the one we describe in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAP.1999.797615","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6462/17274/00797615.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAP.1999.797615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple and efficient connected components labeling algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797615/","displayDocTitle":"A simple and efficient connected components labeling algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6482388","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple and efficient connected components labeling algorithm","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00797615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025158S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6462","citationCount":"110","articleId":"797615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":797683,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The centre of this annulus falls inside the pupil, giving a starting position for a discrete circular active contour (DCAC). The DCAC is moved under the influence of two forces-external and internal. The external force is based on the grey-scales immediately inside and outside of the contour, at each vertex, in both the original and variance images and pushes the vertices inwards. The internal force acts to move the contour towards a perfect polygon, /spl delta/ larger than the current polygon. Repeated trials with decreasing values of /spl delta/ are performed until equilibrium is reached between the two forces and the pupil/iris border has been found.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6489019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Location of the pupil-iris border in slit-lamp images of the cornea","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location of the pupil-iris border in slit-lamp images of the cornea","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"00797683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034423S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6462","citationCount":"46","articleId":"797683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":797744,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The performance analysis is carried out by theoretically characterizing the matching time and the required memory in the best and worst cases. The theoretical analysis is completed by tests on a database of graphs randomly generated. The algorithm is compared with the one proposed by Ullmann (1976): experimental results confirmed the theoretical expectations, highlighting the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

The method employs a multidimensional signal set, where each signal point in the set is a linear transform of a signal point drawn from a multidimensional signal set that is the product of standard two-dimensional signal sets, each rotated about the origin. The peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the proposed system is considered, and it is shown that the PMEPR can be reduced further at the sample points, albeit moderately, by a modification of the proposed signal sets on certain subsets of the subcarriers.

The sampling rate for the tap-input of a LMS detector may be equal to or higher than the chip rate, and these correspond to chip-spaced (CS) and fractionally-spaced (FS) detection, respectively. It is shown in this paper that CS and FS detectors with the same time-span exhibit identical convergence behaviour, if the baseband received signal is strictly bandlimited to half the chip rate. Even in the practical case when this condition is not met, deviations from this observation are imperceptible unless the initial tap-weight vector gives an extremely large mean squared error (MSE). The inadequacy of the eigenvalue spread of the tap-input correlation matrix as an indicator of transient behaviour, and the influence of the initial tap weight vector on convergence speed, are highlighted. Specifically, initialization within the signal subspace or to the origin leads to very much faster convergence compared to initialization in the noise subspace.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Multiuser detectors on board airborne and terrestrial mobile signal monitors attempt the simultaneous detection, in a single receiver, of all communication signals transmitted by the base station of interest. Due to the detrimental effects of transmitter, receiver and channel nonlinearities, very fast multipath fading, Doppler spread, additive white Gaussian noise, and intercell multiple-access interference, the user signals are de-orthogonalized. This leads to performance degradation in conventional receivers that is too severe, especially when the powers of some of the interfering users are dominant. In order to improve upon the performance of conventional matched filter receivers, this article focuses on the development and evaluation of relatively simple successive interference canceling (SIC) algorithms. The techniques we have developed can be used to enable successful interception of CDMA signals; to relax the strict requirements on power control; and to improve the capacity of CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.797790","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

In this case, a lot of bandwidth is wasted due to a low traffic load. To solve this problem and to achieve higher spectral efficiency, a \"QoS balance\" method is developed in this paper to optimise the allocation of transmission power and evaluated in a wide-band DS-CDMA environment integrated with video and voice services. Our simulation results demonstrate that the capacity of the network or spectral efficiency is improved significantly, by this optimal power allocation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for a multi-rate packet CDMA system with multi-media traffic","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

To optimize FEC decoder performance at the receiver, soft information from the DQPSK demodulator is required. For frequency nonselective fading channels, which occur often in these systems, coherent demodulation optimizes performance. In this paper, we derive the maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit estimate for DQPSK modulation in non-ISI channels, assuming knowledge of the channel response. The MAP estimator forms a bit log-likelihood ratio, which provides the optimal \"soft information\" for MLSE or MAP convolutional decoding. Both single and multiantenna receivers are considered. MAP estimation requires exponentiation and logarithm operations, as well as knowledge of the noise covariance. To reduce complexity, two approximate forms are developed which avoid the exponentiation and logarithm operations. If the noise has the same power on each antenna and is uncorrelated between antennas, then knowledge of the noise covariance is also not needed. Performance of the optimal and approximate schemes is evaluated via simulation for single and multi-channel receivers under static and frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading conditions. The approximate approaches are shown to be within 0.5 dB of the optimal approach and to outperform existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.797818","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

This unfortunate reality can degrade the system performance to unacceptable levels. Empirical universal receivers have been developed which achieve asymptotic optimality over a very wide range of channels, and are thus useful in such situations. However, these receivers require training or pilot signals from the channel, which in turn reduces the effective bandwidth of the channel. In this paper, we demonstrate a \"training-free\" empirical receiver which is shown to perform significantly better than reasonably trained universal receivers and nearly as well as the globally optimal receiver. Importantly this receiver is capable of deriving the necessary training information directly from the transmitted communication signal, and thus requires no bandwidth overhead. Applications to QPSK reception are discussed thoroughly.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.797819","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The user preferences have been mapped to utility functions measured in useful bits transmitted per unit of battery energy. We consider utility maximizing distributed power control in the presence of pricing and study the existence and efficiency of equilibria achieved. Specifically, we investigate the Pareto efficiency of a pricing policy that punishes asocial behavior in terms of the transmit power used by each user and hence the interference caused by it. The Nash equilibria achieved under pricing are characterized by using supermodularity. We propose a simple implementation of the pricing scheme where the base station broadcasts a pricing parameter that users use in their distributed power control algorithm. With the appropriate choice of the pricing parameter, all users increase their utilities significantly as compared to the case where there is no pricing.

In this paper we study the effect of time varying user population (sudden death and birth) on the performance of the adaptive space-time multiuser detector proposed by Legnain et al. in frequency selective fading channels. Sudden birth of interferers degrades the performance of the adaptive MMSE detector, and the receiver needs to be readapted each time new interferers appear.

Over a period of several frames, the multipath signal phases in a fading channel give rise to randomly varying phases. By temporally averaging over these phase terms in a noise subspace estimator such as MUSIC, the received signal array covariance matrix will become full rank, even in the presence of coherent signals.

The two sources of range measurement errors in geolocation techniques are measuring error and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error. The NLOS errors, derived from the blocking of direct paths, have been considered as a killer issue in the location estimation. In this paper we develop an algorithm to mitigate the NLOS errors in location estimation when the range measurements corrupted by NLOS errors are not identifiable. This algorithm, referred to as the residual weighting algorithm (Rwgh), assumes that the number of range measurements is greater than the minimum number required. The Rwgh algorithm is compared with two other generic algorithms and tested under various scenarios and NLOS error models, which includes deterministic and random NLOS error models. In both cases, Rwgh has shown the effectiveness of NLOS error mitigation in location estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

We compare the performance of turbo codes using optimum log-MAP decoder and sub-optimum max-log-MAP and SOVA decoding schemes in direct spread forward link (from BS to MS). Different multipath channel environments are studied with Monte-Carlo simulations. The effect of channel estimation is also addressed.

The performance of turbo codes for short block sizes suitable for real time communication systems has gained a lot of attention. We consider the applicability of such codes to a WCDMA radio link based on the requirements of the wireless third generation (3G) systems. We present unequal rate turbo codes (URTC) as an alternative to the conventional equal rate turbo code (ERTC) to obtain an overall code rate equal to 1/4. The URTC provides a reduction in the decoding complexity by almost 33%. This is because the unequal rate turbo decoder uses two soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) decoders while the equal rate turbo decoder uses three SOVA decoders. The performance of the URTC, conventional ERTC, and a convolutional code with the same decoding complexity are considered in AWGN as well as flat fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.797866","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

We review some of these results and show that these gains could also be achieved using simpler receiver structures. We then examine the rates achievable in a multiuser environment, i.e. a multiple access fading channel. The symmetric rate per user is studied and we show that even with simple linear detectors one could obtain non-zero symmetric rates for fading channels (when we have a large number of users). Next we observe that the symmetric rate decreases with the number of users sharing the spectrum. Therefore, one can define a \"user capacity\" which refers to the number of users who can be supported at a desired symmetric rate per user. We evaluate the user capacity as a function of the number of transmit and receive antennas and observe the benefits of using spatial diversity, from this point of view.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multiple access communications using spatial diversity","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

We consider capacity in terms of reliably received rate rather than transmitted rate. We consider capacity achieving strategies under AWGN for transmission of a single packet which is long enough to achieve capacity over the duration of the packet. We combine concepts from multi-access channels and broadcast channels to determine the capacity region for a single transmission of a packet in an ALOHA system. The coding for each user takes into account the possibility of collisions with other users in order to establish a capacity region. Next, we consider the case where we transmit several packets under a channel model where users receive the right to transmit the package according to independent Bernoulli processes.

A multiuser receiver that maximizes the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for each symbol is proposed for multirate CDMA system. It is combined with adaptive power control based on target SIR to provide different quality of service for multiple-data-rate traffic. A theoretical bound is derived to characterize capacity of multi-class traffic CDMA system using the multiuser receiver. Simulations show that actual system capacity in multipath fading environment is close to the theoretical bound at large power constraint. It is also demonstrated that the multiuser receiver is quite effective in increasing capacity of users with higher data rate and lower target bit error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

Users with very different and even time varying rate and quality of service (QoS) requirements will need to be accommodated. In order to provide such diversity, the network has to be able to statistically multiplex different rate and QoS users together while maximizing the spectral efficiency. In a given fixed channel bandwidth, there are two basic methods with which variable rate services may be implemented in the forward link physical layer of a DS CDMA system: allocating each user one code channel that has a variable spreading factor or allocating multiple codes to each user so that the individual user data streams are split into parallel lower rate streams which in turn are each spread by different, higher order orthogonal codes.

Impact on both uniform and hybrid traffic is considered for a multitude of channel models.","displayPublicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

We study how the delay tolerance of non-real-time traffic can be exploited by allowing both transmission power control and variable spreading gain (transmission rate) control. Two control mechanisms adapt the received energy per bit to the current channel conditions and efficiently manage the multiple access interference so as to optimize performance. We provide the jointly optimal power and spreading gain allocation strategy of non-real-time sources. Our strategy maximizes non-real-time throughput subject to constraints on peak transmission power and protects QoS of real-time-services. We show that under the optimal strategy, the optimal spreading gains are inverse linear in the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and transmission power is allocated to the non-real-time sources in decreasing order of channel gain according to a greedy control strategy. We also present numerical results comparing the throughput and delay performance of the optimal strategy with other common strategies; the optimal strategy can offer substantial performance gains.","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.1999.797878","publicationTitle":"WCNC. 1999 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (Cat.

The image of the signature to be recognized (in off-line systems) can be considered as a spatio-temporal signal due to the shapely geometric and sequential character of the pencil drawing. The recognition and classification methods known to us are based on the extraction of geometric parameters and their classification by either a linear or nonlinear classifier. This procedure neglects the temporal information of the signature. In order to alleviate this, this paper proposes to use signature parameters with spatio-temporal information and its classification by a classifier capable of dealing with spatio-temporal problems as hidden Markov models (HMM). The proposed parameters are calculated in two stages; first, the preprocessing stage which includes noise reduction and outline detection through a skeletonization or thinning algorithm; and second, a parameterization stage in which the signature is encoded following the signature line and recording the length and direction of the pencil drawing obtaining a vector that includes the signature spatio-temporal information. The classification of the above parameters is done by a HMM classifier working in the same way as isolated word recognition systems. To design (train and test) the HMM classifier we have built a database of 24 signatures of 60 different writers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signature classification by hidden Markov model","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE 33rd Annual 1999 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (Cat.

Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the strength Pareto EA (SPEA), that combines several features of previous multiobjective EAs in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that SPEA can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface. Moreover, SPEA clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective EAs on the 0/1 knapsack problem.","doi":"10.1109/4235.797969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/17306/00797969.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4235.797969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: a comparative case study and the strength Pareto approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: a comparative case study and the strength Pareto approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797969/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6411649","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: a comparative case study and the strength Pareto approach","sourcePdf":"00797969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025279S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"4661","articleId":"797969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":797971,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

An important feature of the proposed controller is its simple structure. It uses a one-input fuzzy inference with three rules and at most six tuning parameters. A closed-form solution for the control action is defined in terms of the nonlinear tuning parameters. The nonlinear proportional gain is explicitly derived in the error domain. A conservative design strategy is proposed for realizing a guaranteed-PID-performance (GPP) fuzzy controller. This strategy suggests that a fuzzy PID controller should be able to produce a linear function from its nonlinearity tuning of the system. The proposed PID system is able to produce a close approximation of a linear function for approximating the GPP system. This GPP system, incorporated with a genetic solver for the optimization, will provide the performance no worse than the corresponding linear controller with respect to the specific performance criteria. Two indexes, linearity approximation index (LAI) and nonlinearity variation index (NVI), are suggested for evaluating the nonlinear design of fuzzy controllers. The proposed control system has been applied to several first-order, second-order, and fifth-order processes. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy PID controller produces superior control performance to the conventional PID controllers, particularly in handling nonlinearities due to time delay and saturation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6408273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"New methodology for analytical and optimal design of fuzzy PID controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New methodology for analytical and optimal design of fuzzy PID controllers","sourcePdf":"00797977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056298S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"163","articleId":"797977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":797979,"authors":[{"name":"G.

As the fuzzy inference can be divided into different processing phases, the processor is made up of a number of stages which are pipelined. In each stage several inference processing phases are performed parallelly. Its performance is in the order of 2 MFLIPS with 256 rules, eight inputs, two chained variables, and four outputs and 5.2 MFLIPS with 32 rules, three inputs, and one output with a clock frequency of 66 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/17307/00797979.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.797979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.797979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI hardware architecture for complex fuzzy systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Hardware","Fuzzy systems","Computer architecture","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Fuzzy sets","Phase detection","Clocks","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","pipeline processing","parallel architectures","fuzzy set theory","inference mechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI hardware architecture","complex fuzzy systems","VLSI fuzzy processor","complex fuzzy inference systems","rule chaining","computational model","parallel computation","activation degree","membership function representation","/spl alpha/-level sets","pipeline processing","66 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"VLSI hardware architecture for complex fuzzy systems","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6408275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI hardware architecture for complex fuzzy systems","sourcePdf":"00797979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040436S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"43","articleId":"797979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":797980,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Sen Chen","id":"37280633300"},{"name":"Chung-Shi Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Shi Tseng","id":"37275611600"},{"name":"Huey-Jian Uang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Huey-Jian Uang","id":"37329523300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"797980","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":342,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy control","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Robust control","Optimal control","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Control design","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamical systems","linear systems","nonlinear control systems","fuzzy control","control system synthesis","robust control","H/sup /spl infin control","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamic systems","fuzzy linear control design method","optimal H/sup /spl infin// robustness performance","nonlinear system stabilization","H/sup /spl infin// performance design","nonlinear control systems","linear matrix inequality techniques","LMI techniques","fuzzy observer-based H/sup /spl infin// control","robust optimization design"]}],"abstract":"This study introduces a fuzzy linear control design method for nonlinear systems with optimal H/sup /spl infin// robustness performance. First, the Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy linear model (1985) is employed to approximate a nonlinear system. Next, based on the fuzzy linear model, a fuzzy controller is developed to stabilize the nonlinear system, and at the same time the effect of external disturbance on control performance is attenuated to a minimum level. Thus based on the fuzzy linear model, H/sup /spl infin// performance design can be achieved in nonlinear control systems. In the proposed fuzzy linear control method, the fuzzy linear model provides rough control to approximate the nonlinear control system, while the H/sup /spl infin// scheme provides precise control to achieve the optimal robustness performance. Linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques are employed to solve this robust fuzzy control problem. In the case that state variables are unavailable, a fuzzy observer-based H/sup /spl infin// control is also proposed to achieve a robust optimization design for nonlinear systems. A simulation example is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed design method.","doi":"10.1109/91.797980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/17307/00797980.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.797980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness design of nonlinear dynamic systems via fuzzy linear control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797980/","displayDocTitle":"Robustness design of nonlinear dynamic systems via fuzzy linear control","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6408276","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness design of nonlinear dynamic systems via fuzzy linear control","sourcePdf":"00797980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032402S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"342","articleId":"797980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":797981,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Nawa et al. (1997) proposed the pseudobacterial genetic algorithm (PBGA) that incorporates a modified mutation operator called bacterial mutation, based on a biological phenomenon of microbial evolution. The BEA has the same features of the PBGA, but introduces a new operation, called gene transfer operation, equally inspired by a microbial evolution phenomenon. While the bacterial mutation performs local optimization within the limits of a single chromosome, the gene transfer operation allows the chromosomes to directly transfer information to the other counterparts in the population. The gene transfer is inspired by the phenomenon of transfer of strands of genes in a population of bacteria. By means of this mechanism, one bacterium can rapidly spread its genetic information to other cells. Numerical experiments were performed to show the effectiveness of the BEA. The obtained results show the benefits that can be obtained with this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/797983/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6408279","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy system parameters discovery by bacterial evolutionary algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy system parameters discovery by bacterial evolutionary algorithm","sourcePdf":"00797983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037481S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"145","articleId":"797983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":797984,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Li-Xin Wang","id":"37280760900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"797984","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":197,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":776},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Input variables","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy sets","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Control systems","Impedance matching","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical systems","fuzzy systems","approximation theory","gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical fuzzy system analysis","hierarchical fuzzy system design","universal approximators","sensitivity analysis","gradient descent algorithm","parameter tuning","input-output pairs","I/O pairs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=797984","abstract":"In this letter, the hierarchical fuzzy systems are analyzed and designed.

The PBG structure is a two-dimensional square lattice with each cell consisting of metal pads and four connecting lines, which are etched on a conductor-backed Duroid substrate. This uniplanar compact PBG structure realizes a magnetic surface in the stopband and is used in the waveguide walls to provide magnetic boundary conditions. A relatively uniform field distribution along the cross section has been measured at frequencies from 9.4 to 10.4 GHz. Phase velocities close to the speed of light have also been observed in the stopband, indicating that TEM mode has been established. A recently developed quasi-Yagi antenna has been employed as a broad-band and efficient waveguide transition. Meanwhile, full-wave simulations using the finite-difference time-domain method provide accurate predictions for the characteristics of both the perfect magnetic conductor impedance surface and the waveguide structure. This novel waveguide structure should find a wide range of applications in different areas, including quasi-optical power combining and the electromagnetic compatibility testing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17309/00798004.pdf","startPage":"2092","endPage":"2098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.798004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.798004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=798004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel TEM waveguide using uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap (UC-PBG) structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic waveguides","Surface waves","Photonic band gap","Lattices","Joining processes","Etching","Boundary conditions","Antenna measurements","Frequency measurement","Magnetic field measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","photonic band gap","waveguide transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TEM waveguide","uniplanar compact photonic bandgap structure","two-dimensional square lattice","boundary condition","quasi-Yagi antenna","waveguide transition","full-wave simulation","finite-difference time-domain method","perfect magnetic conductor impedance surface","quasi-optical power combining","electromagnetic compatibility testing","phase velocity","Duroid substrate","field distribution","9.4 to 10.4 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"A novel TEM waveguide using uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap (UC-PBG) structure","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6412427","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel TEM waveguide using uniplanar compact photonic-bandgap (UC-PBG) structure","sourcePdf":"00798004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047426S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"262","articleId":"798004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":798005,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

It is composed of dielectric parabolic layers associated to obtain a PBG material. The frequency gap is used to reflect and focus the electromagnetic waves. This device has been designed using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code. FDTD computations have provided the theoretical reflector's directivity. These results are in good agreement with measurements, and it appears that the PBG reflector presents the same directivity as a metallic parabola. A second application uses a defect PBG material mode associated with a metallic plate to increase the directivity of a patch antenna. We explain the design of such a device and propose experimental results to validate the theoretical analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directive antennas","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Photonic band gap","Dielectric materials","Reflector antennas","Frequency","Electromagnetic scattering","Antenna measurements","Dielectric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","photonic band gap","microwave photonics","reflector antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip antennas","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive photonic-bandgap antennas","photonic bandgap material applications","photonic parabolic reflector","dielectric parabolic layers","frequency gap","finite-difference time-domain method","defect PBG material mode","patch antenna"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.798007","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17309/00798007.pdf","doi":"10.1109/22.798007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directive photonic-bandgap antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Directive photonic-bandgap antennas","accessionNumber":"6412430","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","volume":"47","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directive photonic-bandgap antennas","sourcePdf":"00798007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031926S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"256","articleId":"798007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":798008,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The thicker substrate is then used to enhance broadside gain of a patch antenna working in the stopband at 12 GHz.

A wide range of radiation patterns can be achieved with this type of antenna and, due to the ease of manufacture, is inexpensive compared with other types of antennas. However, patch-antenna designs have some limitations such as restricted bandwidth of operation, low gain, and a potential decrease in radiation efficiency due to surface-wave losses. In this paper, a photonic-bandgap (PBG) substrate for patch antennas is proposed, which minimizes the surface-wave effects. In order to verify the performance of this kind of substrate, a configuration with a thick substrate is analyzed. The PBG patch antenna shows significantly reduced levels of surface modes compared to conventional patch antennas, thus improving the gain and far-field radiation pattern.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17309/00798009.pdf","startPage":"2131","endPage":"2138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.798009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.798009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=798009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced patch-antenna performance by suppressing surface waves using photonic-bandgap substrates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Periodic structures","Optical surface waves","Electromagnetic propagation","Optical materials","Dispersion","Substrates","Patch antennas","Optical control","Crystalline materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","surface electromagnetic waves","photonic band gap","antenna radiation patterns","losses","UHF antennas","substrates","microwave materials","dielectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch-antenna performance enhancement","surface waves suppression","photonic-bandgap substrates","microstrip patch antenna","low-profile robust planar structure","radiation patterns","surface-wave losses","PBG substrate","thick substrate","gain improvement","far-field pattern improvement","periodic dielectric material"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced patch-antenna performance by suppressing surface waves using photonic-bandgap substrates","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6412432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced patch-antenna performance by suppressing surface waves using photonic-bandgap substrates","sourcePdf":"00798009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045826S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"343","articleId":"798009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":798010,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

In the paper, a compliant contact model with nonlinear damping is investigated, and many previously unknown characteristics of the model are developed. Compliance is used to eliminate many of the problems associated with using rigid body models with Coulomb friction, while the use of nonlinear damping eliminates the discontinuous impact forces and most sticky tensile forces which arise in Kelvin-Voigt linear models. Two of the most important characteristics of the model are the dependence of the coefficient of restitution on velocity and damping in a physically meaningful manner, and its computational simplicity. A full mathematical development for an impact response is given, along with the effects of the system and model parameters on energy loss. A quasistatic analysis gives results which are consistent with energy loss characteristics of a more complex distributed foundation model under sustained contact conditions. A foot contact example for a walking machine is given which demonstrates the applicability of the model for impact on foot placement, sustained contact during the support phase, and the breaking of the contact upon liftoff of the foot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6405145","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A compliant contact model with nonlinear damping for simulation of robotic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compliant contact model with nonlinear damping for simulation of robotic systems","sourcePdf":"00798060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029002S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"148","articleId":"798060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":798062,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A fuzzy inference system is adopted to determine the value of the weight that multiplies the set-point for the proportional action, based on the current output error and its time derivative. In this way, both the overshoot and the rise time in set-point following can be reduced. The values of the proportional gain and the integral and derivative time constant are determined according to the well-known Ziegler-Nichols formula so that a good load disturbance attenuation is also assured. The methodology is shown to be effective for a large range of processes and is valuable for industrial settings since it is intuitive, it requires only a small extra computational effort, and it is robust with regard to parameter variations. The tuning of the parameters of the fuzzy module can be easily done by hand or by means of an autotuning procedure based on genetic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6405147","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based set-point weight tuning of PID controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based set-point weight tuning of PID controllers","sourcePdf":"00798062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025593S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"139","articleId":"798062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":798069,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The quality measure of the modalities data is used for fuzzification. Two modifications of the FKM and FVQ algorithms, based on a fuzzy vector distance definition, are proposed to handle the fuzzy data and utilize the quality measure. Simulations show that fuzzy clustering algorithms have better performance compared to the classical clustering algorithms and other known fusion algorithms.

In an appropriately designed ring cavity, a pulse can be compressed from a few hundred picoseconds to several picoseconds, as a result of the interplay between linear coupling and gain saturation in the MMI waveguide amplifier. The asymptotically stable pulse peak position and pulsewidth imply the feasibility of passively mode-locking semiconductor lasers.

As linewidths are reduced, the sources of CD errors do not automatically scale, and the detection of process excursions becomes more critical. An optimized CD measurement sampling plan can ensure an economical baseline control and the effective detection of process excursions. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing measurement sampling, analysis, and control techniques in their ability to identify certain CD process exclusions. We present a comprehensive methodology to characterize the process baseline variations and process excursions. Sampling plan choices ape evaluated and based on the balance between leaving material at risk (beta error) and generating false alarms (alpha risk). With the availability of specific fab data such as wafer starts and die selling price, the sample planning model can be used to evaluate costs and risk of alternate sampling plans. Specific fab cost data also allows for the calculation of the cost optimal sampling plan for a given inspection capacity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.1999.798202","publicationTitle":"10th Annual IEEE/SEMI.

The essential feature of the proposed fuzzy controller is that the shrinking span membership functions (SSSMFs) is used for membership functions. The SSMFs is a new means of designating membership functions of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). A genetic algorithm is used to select optimum values for SSMFs FLC parameters namely shrinking, overlapping and gain factors. A single machine connected to an infinite bus system through a transmission line is considered to demonstrate the suggested technique. The parameters of a SSMFs FLC, which simultaneously stabilises the set of plant operating conditions is determined off-line using a genetic algorithm and an objective function based on integral absolute and steady state errors in /spl Delta/w.

Progress in application of artificial neural network technology to power systems in the areas of load forecasting, security assessment and fault diagnosis among others, has led to overcoming some of the limitations in the short term load forecasting problem. Improvements in forecasting are of paramount importance as an SLF program must guide the decision making of power system operators and also respond accurately and consistently to system changes. In this paper, a fast emerging field of ANN is described for a short term load forecasting (ANNSTLF) model, which implements the multiLayer feedforward backpropagation algorithm. The backpropagation algorithm with MLP model of artificial neural network is developed for the problem of short term load forecasting with a lead time of at least 24 hours. The best performance was obtained for the load forecasting for the Tuesday for which the maximum and average percentage error of 2.00% and 0.20% respectively was found. This came very close to the precision obtained by the human forecaster. The ability of a neural network to generalize the information presented is used to train the network.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1998.798287","startPage":"588","endPage":"595 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE TENCON '98.

There are too many low-level details that have to do not with the desired content-e.g., shapes, appearance and behavior-but rather how to get a computer to present the content. For instance, behavior such as motion and growth are generally gradual, continuous phenomena. Moreover, many such behaviors go on simultaneously. Computers, on the other hand, cannot directly accommodate either of these basic properties, because they do their work in discrete steps rather than continuously, and they only do one thing at a time. Graphics programmers have to spend much of their effort bridging the gap between what an animation is and how to present it on a computer. We propose that this situation can be improved by a change of language, and present Fran, synthesized by complementing an existing declarative host language, Haskell, with an embedded domain-specific vocabulary for modeled animation. As demonstrated in a collection of examples, the resulting animation descriptions are not only relatively easy to write, but also highly composable.","doi":"10.1109/32.798320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.798320","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/17351/00798320.pdf","startPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An embedded modeling language approach to interactive 3D and multimedia animation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798320/","displayDocTitle":"An embedded modeling language approach to interactive 3D and multimedia animation","volume":"25","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6412677","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An embedded modeling language approach to interactive 3D and multimedia animation","sourcePdf":"00798320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046882S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1999","isNumber":"17351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"23","articleId":"798320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":798337,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

ISTORE exploits introspection to provide high availability, performance, and scalability while drastically reducing the cost and complexity of administration. An ISTORE-based server monitors and adapts to changes in the imposed workload and to unexpected system events such as hardware failure. This adaptability is enabled by a combination of intelligent self-monitoring hardware components and an extensible software framework that allows the target application to specify monitoring and adaptation policies to the system.","doi":"10.1109/HOTOS.1999.798374","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6496/17344/00798374.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOTOS.1999.798374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISTORE: introspective storage for data-intensive network services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"ISTORE: introspective storage for data-intensive network services","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6370338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30-30 March 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISTORE: introspective storage for data-intensive network services","confLoc":"Rio Rico, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00798374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109579S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6496","citationCount":"20","articleId":"798374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":798396,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The goal is to achieve a carrier frequency estimate with an error smaller than 1% of the subcarrier spacing and a timing estimate that avoids ISI in the receiver. Three joint coarse timing and fine frequency estimation algorithms are compared, where the results for the simplest one are similar to the ones for the others with more hardware complexity. The best results for coarse carrier frequency offset are obtained with a data-aided (DA) scheme using the fixed pilot tones. A new method is derived for fine timing estimation for one-path channels.

Although several communication protocols have been proposed, the problems of interference have largely been ignored. In particular, the problem of interference from vehicles in oncoming lanes has not been investigated before. We examine the problem of interference from vehicles in oncoming lanes and show that the worst case presents a level of interference which must be avoided. The results in this paper are confirmed by both theoretic modeling and computer simulation using a Rician fading model in the millimeter wave band. The use of directional or beam antennas, coupled with separating the frequency band into forward transmit/reverse receive, and reverse transmit/forward receive is suggested as the solution to the problems of interference from oncoming vehicles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798430/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6512987","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Interference characteristics in inter-vehicle communication from oncoming vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference characteristics in inter-vehicle communication from oncoming vehicles","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00798430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021594S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454","citationCount":"11","articleId":"798430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":798438,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The IS-95 2/sup nd/ generation digital code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular standard has potential to accommodate mobile positioning in its architecture. Moreover, on the eve of the 3/sup rd/ generation (3G) wireless network standardization, required steps must be taken for the implementation of mobile positioning. In this paper, mobile positioning in CDMA cellular networks has been discussed, the simulation and the measurement results using standard CDMA mobile phones, are presented. The purpose of this study is to analyse the accuracy of mobile positioning using standard CDMA mobile phones. Positioning calculations were performed in the mobile station using the CDMA forward link channels in order to provide total privacy. This technique can also be incorporated in the 3G WCDMA networks.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.798438","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

An obstacle in this context is the time-variability of the channel. To achieve a high throughput also over fading channels, adaptive methods for adjustment of, for example, the modulation alphabet, and the coding complexity, can be used. We investigate the effect of adaptive modulation, along with time-slot scheduling of IP-like traffic in a scenario involving several types of mobile hosts and one base station. We extend a study of the impact of adaptive modulation and scheduling on the bit error rate, to include models for packet length and packet inter-arrival, to find the queueing delay imposed by our proposed scheduling algorithm. Our scheduler keeps the bit error rate at attractively low, prespecified levels, well suited for forward error correction (FEC) codes. Moreover, the scheduler splits the bandwidth between different types of traffic in a desirable way, according to the traffic situation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive modulation and scheduling of IP traffic over fading channels","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This is why the MAI can be suppressed by channel equalization. In this paper we present a receiver algorithm which performs adaptive channel equalization by estimating the transmitted chip sequence. The adaptation uses Griffiths' algorithm and converges to the LMMSE solution. The receiver is applicable in systems using long code scrambling such as in the 3/sup rd/ generation wideband CDMA proposals, and it is shown to offer significant performance gains when compared to conventional RAKE receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference suppression in CDMA downlink through adaptive channel equalization","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Designers typically depict the structure of software systems as one or more directed graphs. For example, a directed graph can be used to describe the modules (or classes) of a system and their static interrelationships using nodes and directed edges, respectively. We call such graphs \"module dependency graphs\" (MDGs). MDGs can be large and complex graphs. One way of making them more accessible is to partition them, separating their nodes (i.e. modules) into clusters (i.e. subsystems). In this paper, we describe a technique for finding \"good\" MDG partitions. Good partitions feature relatively independent subsystems that contain modules which are highly interdependent. Our technique treats finding a good partition as an optimization problem, and uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to search the extraordinarily large solution space of all possible MDG partitions. The effectiveness of our technique is demonstrated by applying it to a medium-sized software system.","doi":"10.1109/STEP.1999.798481","startPage":"73","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"STEP '99.

While neural networks have good ability to map any reasonable continuous function, they do not easily explain how the inputs are related to an output, and also whether the selected inputs have any significant relationship with an output. There is quite often a need to identify some order of influence of the input variables on the output variable. In this paper, a technique for determining the order of influence of the n elements of the input vector on the m elements of the output vector is presented and discussed. While a sample mathematical function is used to introduce the technique, a more practical application of this method in the aluminium smelting industry is considered.

Machining performance prediction involving various process variables is a nonlinear problem. The conventional mechanics of the cutting approach for predicting thrust and torque in drilling makes use of the oblique cutting theory and an orthogonal cutting databank. The quantitative reliability, in these models, depends on the 'input parameters' along with the 'edge force' components from the orthogonal cutting databank for that given work material. By contrast, neural networks for drilling performance prediction have been shown to be successful for quantitative predictions with minimum number of inputs. In this paper, an RBF neural network architecture is proposed which uses process variables such as tool geometry and operating conditions to estimate thrust and torque in drilling. Extensive drilling tests are carried out to train the RBF network. The developed network is tested over a range of process variables to estimate thrust and torque. It is shown that, using the neural network architecture, the drilling forces are 'simultaneously' predicted to within 5% of the experimental values.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.1999.798501","pdfPath":"/iel5/6474/17315/00798501.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications.

An abstract specification of the design is converted to a set of appropriate input vectors using a mathematical method, called \"multidimensional scaling\". These vectors which have, in general, higher dimensionality, are fed to the self-organizing map at random in order to map them onto a 2-dimensional plane of the regular chip. The mapping is done in such a way that the cells with higher connectivity are placed close to each other, hence minimizing total connection length in the design. The results show improvement over other neural network based approaches in terms of both efficiency and the quality of results. The capability of our approach in handling external ports as well as nonrectangular (rectilinear) boundaries makes it appropriate for the placement of hierarchical designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/798503/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6382654","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Kohonen map for the placement of regular VLSI designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Kohonen map for the placement of regular VLSI designs","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"00798503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043316S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6474","articleId":"798503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":798504,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Side-by-side, object oriented computing has revolutionised, during the current decade, the style of programming and software system design and development which is now configured around the 'class' concept. We present a general purpose object oriented toolkit which serves as a generic utility for wide ranging applications involving optimisation of both single and multiple objectives. The toolkit supports the state of the art of genetic optimisation techniques; the design is modular, flexible and extensible, in line with the object oriented programming paradigm. The toolkit is currently being implemented in C++ for obvious reasons of wider support and portability across platforms. Templates and derived classes are used for elegance and reuse of the code and the library. The interfaces try to hide as many of the implementation details as possible so that the programming and modification at higher level become simple. Nonetheless, defining interfaces is an iterative process, so with the design and implementation of the toolkit, with each major addition and upgrade, they are constantly evolving.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.1999.798509","startPage":"96","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications.

The main difficulties lie in the matching of different elements of every image, the so-called correspondence problem. According to the trend of analysing singular points of the scene, we opt for a system based on the labelling and matching of contours and corners of the scene. Those points have some properties that make the method usable for most kinds of images. In order to obtain the contour information, a new algorithm is developed which is hardware implementable, able to autoadapt its parameters to external characteristics (such as as focus, illumination, contrast, etc.), and provides high reliability to the depth obtaining system. A specialised hardware is designed for contour obtaining and labelling with a fast and highly efficient pipeline architecture that gives the system a fast response time.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIMA.1999.798530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications.

The human face is the most important region within a frame and should be coded with high fidelity. To preserve perceptually important information at low bit rates, such as face regions, skin-tone is used to detect and adaptively quantize these regions. Novel features of this coder are the use of overlapping block motion compensation in combination with discrete wavelet transform, followed by zerotree entropy coding with new scanning procedure of wavelet blocks such that the rest of the H.263 framework can be used.

We focus our attention on the multi-beam combining scheme for a DS-CDMA system, which has RAKE combiners in multiple overlapped beams. It is a very attractive technique in the sense that the maximal ratio combining is carried out in the space and time domains. However, in a practical situation, since terminals in their own sector are not uniformly located, the interference levels in different beams are different. Therefore, the receivers at the base station do not achieve ideal combining. This paper proposes a multi-beam combining scheme for DS-CDMA using a weighting factor based on the interference level of each beam. The performance of the proposed scheme in the reverse link is evaluated by computer simulation. The results show that the proposed scheme has a good performance even if the terminals in their own sector are not uniformly located.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.798584","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The parameters of the UTRA (UMTS terrestrial radio access) air interface were used for this investigation. A statistical approach assuming a spatially uniform user distribution was taken to investigate the capacity reduction due to ACI. The probability density function (PDF) of ACI at the base station (BS) of interest was calculated and by defining a certain outage threshold (P/sub out/), the interference used to calculate the capacity loss was determined. A path loss model which accounts for the correlation of log normal shadowing between the useful link and interference link was adopted. The impact of the following parameters were studied: (a) BS separation, (b) adjacent channel protection (ACP), (c) load in the interfering cell and (d) frame synchronisation. It was found that there are sub-optimal BS separations due to a tradeoff between MS/spl rarr/BS and BS/spl rarr/BS interference. Moreover, it became apparent that an intelligent dynamic channel assignment (DCA) algorithm is required.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.798603","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Knowing the channel characteristics of all the users at the base station, the sub-carrier allocation algorithm assigns sub-carriers to the users in a way that the total transmit power is minimized. An optimal algorithm is presented to provide the best sub-carrier assignment. The complexity of the optimal solution renders it impractical for real-time application. To deal with the frequently changing channel characteristic of a fast time-varying multipath fading channel, a heuristic algorithm based on constructive assignment and iterative improvement is proposed which can give out a valid solution in real time. Experimental results show that the performance of this real-time algorithm is close to that of the optimal allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

It is a well-known fact that CDMA systems need accurate power control to achieve good performance. Detailed models of link level characteristics are needed in order to achieve reliable system level performance estimates of the power control algorithms. By including characteristic link level parameters such as FER, C/I and BER, together with multipath fading and a complete implementation of the closed and outer loop power control algorithms, we have created an environment for realistic simulations of the system algorithms. This enables us to study the effects on the system performance of e.g. delay, measurement errors, velocities of mobiles, multipath fading, and our power control algorithms in a dynamic cellular environment. The driving force behind our simulator implementation is to continuously improve the performance of the system algorithms and thus, in the end, to increase the capacity. The results show that a system simulator which includes detailed link level characteristics is a useful tool when studying the effects of the non-ideal power control.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The idea is to assign orthogonal spreading sequences to the first N users and pseudo-noise (PN) spreading sequences to all additional users. The proposed technique can thus accommodate N users without any mutual interference and some additional at the expense of some signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty. This represents a significant capacity increase with respect to presently available multiple access techniques. When the number of users is larger than N, detection is performed in two separate steps, one for the set of users with orthogonal spreading sequences and one for the set of users with PN sequences. Furthermore, the process is iterated two or more times to obtain more reliable receiver decisions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

For that reason, when soft handoff is performed with the same amount of communication line resources as hard handoff, the call blocking probability is higher than for hard handoff. We therefore evaluate the traffic characteristics for the various multi-connection line set-up methods, which include immediate call processing, a simple queuing processing, and a modified queuing processing to give a priority to fast-moving calls, by means of a computer simulation. The evaluation results show that the probability of forced termination at handoff can be reduced by employing a queuing scheme at the time of multi-connection line setup and that the probability of call termination can be further reduced by giving fast-moving calls priority in the allocation of multi-connection lines.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In a torque drive, this variation will cause a change in developed torque in the machine. A parameter compensation scheme using reactive power feedback control is proposed in this paper. Reactive power can be calculated in PMSM drives since it reflects change in the rotor flux linkage accurately while not having the detrimental effect of instrumenting the value of stator resistance in the controller. Then this reactive power can be used to compensate for the variation in torque. The proposed scheme is incorporated in the dynamic model of the PMSM drive and verified for step and ramp changes in rotor flux linkage in a torque drive. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed technique. The contrast between the proposed scheme and another method based on air gap power feedback control is included in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.1999.798691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1999.798691","publicationTitle":"ISIE '99.

The first scheme uses values of the voltage reference to generate an adequate flux weakening component of the stator current, whereas the second method detects an increase of the tracking error in torque-producing current component and uses the error signal for the flux weakening control. The viability of the algorithms has been demonstrated and the schemes have been compared and analyzed in steady-state operation. The transient behavior is very important for electric vehicles and other high-performance applications. Here, the authors analyze the transient response characteristics of both schemes when a sudden change in the torque reference is received.

The dimming feature is accomplished by controlling the DC-link voltage of the inverter stage of the electronic ballast. Based on the power-dependent lamp model, the control equations are derived by fundamental approximation, and then the dimming characteristics of the fluorescent lamp can be calculated. Satisfied performances are achieved by properly choosing the circuit parameters under the considerations of the filament heating, the starting voltage, switching losses, circuit component stresses and the applicable DC-link voltage range. An electronic ballast with the half-bridge series-resonant parallel-load inverter for the rapid-start fluorescent lamp is used as an example for illustrating the design procedure.

The accurate phase angle information of utility voltage is essential to the active power conversion systems tied to the utility line. The angle information can be easily corrupted by the distorted utility voltage such as voltage unbalance and harmonics in the waveform. Thus, large harmonics may be caused in the current or voltage reference signal whose phase angle is based on the detected voltage phase angle. First, focusing on the distorted utility condition, effects of the several phase angle detecting methods on the operation of PWM rectifiers and active filters are investigated. Then a new voltage phase angle detector is proposed using voltage sequence detector and PI controller. The proposed method does not cause harmonics in the reference signal by adequately eliminating unbalance components and high-order harmonic terms in the utility voltage. The basic principle of the proposed method is described in detail. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed strategy compared with the conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.798754","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

However, the performance of oil impregnated kraft paper (OIP) has not been established under the environment of unconventional voltage which appear in HVDC systems, EHV transformers and others. In the present investigations, the breakdown studies on impregnated and unimpregnated kraft insulating paper of different thickness have been carried out under different field configurations like uniform, moderately uniform and nonuniform fields. The influence of different types of voltages such as ac, dc and combined ac and dc voltages on the performance of insulation paper and oil impregnated paper have been studied. In addition, for the ac system, the influence of additional dc stresses, the range and corresponding voltage as a percentage of applied ac voltage have been analyzed and discussed. Comparison has been presented with respect to field configuration, applied conventional and non conventional voltage. Dependence on other experimental variables like ac component, dc bias, electrode gaps in oil medium and others for both kraft insulating paper and oil impregnated paper (OIP) is also reported. These aspects may provide valuable data for reliable design of large EHV transformers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of anomalous breakdown of paper-oil insulation under unconventional voltages","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1999 IEEE 13th International Conference on Dielectric Liquids (ICDL'99) (Cat.

Liquid nitrogen is a promising cooling and basic insulating agent for fluid-transparent dielectric structures in power apparatus using superconductors with high critical temperature, However, evaluation of strength data from small-scaled multishot breakdown experiments requires extrapolation. The inherent statistical scattering of liquid nitrogen breakdown data then is a key phenomenon. Extrapolation which relies onto Weibull statistics has been claimed to be an adequate procedure, where breakdown experiments with different ramp speeds give background for Weibull parameter estimation. Thus, multishot breakdown tests with dc ramps ranging from almost 70 kV/s down to less than 0.05 kV/s have been carried out. Liquid nitrogen with technical quality was filtered and filled into a cryostat, which housed the concentric electrode arrangement; the electrodes consisting of polished stainless steel. Bubbles inside the 1.25 mm gap caused by heat transfer were eliminated by thermal double shielding. Breakdown data sets could be passably well fitted to a two-parameter Weibull function at a mean strength of roughly 15 kV/mm. It seems that liquid nitrogen exhibits almost no memory effect.","doi":"10.1109/ICDL.1999.798968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL.1999.798968","startPage":"445","endPage":"448","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1999 IEEE 13th International Conference on Dielectric Liquids (ICDL'99) (Cat.

The demand for standardization of the measurement has been raised because of the differences of the methods of measurement and evaluation of ECT. Also many types of measuring apparatus developed up to now have been evaluated for standardization of measuring methods at CIGRE. In the preliminary draft published recently it was concluded that the Mini-static Test is suitable for standardization with high reproducibility and repeatability. However, the ECT value obtained by a Mini-static Tester is often influenced by oil flow rate and varies largely even when using filters from the same lot. Recent investigation showed that the negative dependence of ECT on oil flow rate is caused by the property of the paper filter. The Mini-static Test was recommended as the standard method of ECT measurement although one needs to take a little care of the property of the paper filter in the report by Electric Technology Research Association (ETRA).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1999 IEEE 13th International Conference on Dielectric Liquids (ICDL'99) (Cat.

The presented structures are fitted with magnets on one rotor, which do not have the same angular width, and magnets on the other rotor, which are not necessarily jointive and do not necessarily have the same angular width. As a result, these structures appear to be very interesting in terms of maximum torque, torque-to-weight ratio, and magnet volume.

The unbalanced force due to rotor eccentricity caused by manufacturing imprecision or bearing defects is one possible source of excitation to vibration. The previously developed fast design package for permanent magnet motors, based on magnetic lumped parameter modeling, is modified to predict the influence of rotor eccentricity. Both static and dynamic cases are investigated. Magnetic material nonlinearity is taken into consideration. A two-dimensional relative permeance function is derived by conformal transformation followed by the modification of permeances modeling the air gap. Static and dynamic rotor eccentricity bring different effects to symmetric and asymmetric motors and are discussed separately.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17358/00799071.pdf","startPage":"4226","endPage":"4231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic lumped parameter modeling of rotor eccentricity in brushless permanent-magnet motors","doi":"10.1109/20.799071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.799071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic lumped parameter modeling of rotor eccentricity in brushless permanent-magnet motors","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6399396","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic lumped parameter modeling of rotor eccentricity in brushless permanent-magnet motors","sourcePdf":"00799071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032366S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"799071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799073,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

A two-step design procedure is utilized. First the geometry of the permanent-magnet rotor is derived by a one-dimensional field analysis coupled to a multiobjective minimization technique. The objective function of the minimization is defined as a combination of the electromotive force harmonic components induced in the stator and of the harmonic components of the air-gap magnet permeance. As a second step, a two-dimensional numerical model, solved through a finite element method, is adopted to further improve the analysis of the magnetic field. This allows the optimization of the magnet arc width and the minimization of the cogging torque. The method described has been used for the design of a three-phase, six-pole, permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Experimental tests have been carried out to verify the results obtained by the design procedure.","doi":"10.1109/20.799073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17358/00799073.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.799073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"4238","endPage":"4246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a multiobjective minimization technique for reducing the torque ripple in permanent-magnet motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Application of a multiobjective minimization technique for reducing the torque ripple in permanent-magnet motors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799073/","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6399398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a multiobjective minimization technique for reducing the torque ripple in permanent-magnet motors","sourcePdf":"00799073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078472S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","articleId":"799073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799074,"authors":[{"name":"H.B.

At the design stage determination of these characteristics presents difficulties because of highly nonlinear behavior of the magnetic circuit. It is possible to use numerical field solution of the complete motor to obtain this information. This, however, requires expertise on a professional program and may be expensive if used to search for the best design. This paper shows that a reduced model can be used to obtain the desired information accurately. It is also shown that in fact obtaining field solutions just for a pair of teeth is enough for accurately predicting the flux linkage and torque characteristics of a motor. The approach introduced here makes possible searching for an optimum design (even on a PC) for maximizing average torque or reducing noise and vibration problems, since the effort for producing the model and computation time are greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/20.799074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.799074","endPage":"4258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17358/00799074.pdf","startPage":"4247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of torque and inductance displacement characteristics of asymmetrically slotted variable-reluctance motors using a simplified model for numerical field solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799074/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of torque and inductance displacement characteristics of asymmetrically slotted variable-reluctance motors using a simplified model for numerical field solution","volume":"35","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6399399","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of torque and inductance displacement characteristics of asymmetrically slotted variable-reluctance motors using a simplified model for numerical field solution","sourcePdf":"00799074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051717S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","articleId":"799074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":799080,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These strains are achieved in the martensitic state through field-induced variant rearrangement. An experimental apparatus is described that provides biaxial magnetic fields and uniaxial compressive prestress with temperature control while recording microstructural changes with optical microscopy. The magnetostrictive response is found to be sensitive to the initial state induced by stress-biasing the martensitic variant structure, and exhibits rate effects related to twin boundary mobility. Experiments performed with constant stress demonstrate work output capacity. Experimental results are interpreted by using a theory based on minimization of a micromagnetic energy functional that includes applied field, stress, and demagnetization energies. It is found that the theory provides a good qualitative description of material behavior, but significantly overpredicts the amount of strain produced. Issues concerning the martensitic magnetic anisotropy and variant nucleation are discussed with regard to this discrepancy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferromagnetic shape memory in the NiMnGa system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.799080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17358/00799080.pdf","startPage":"4301","endPage":"4310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.799080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Ferromagnetic shape memory in the NiMnGa system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6399413","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferromagnetic shape memory in the NiMnGa system","sourcePdf":"00799080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050696S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"49","articleId":"799080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799083,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","IBM, Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yun Zhang","id":"38559445600"},{"name":"N.H.

Each protection relay in the power network needs to be coordinated with the relays protecting the adjacent equipment. The overall protection coordination is thus very complicated. A new concept of protection coordination by time is introduced in this paper to formulate all the system relays and system equipment operation into a set of optimization equations and constraints. Its purpose is to search for an optimal protection setting to minimize the system disturbance time as well as the time of interruption of power supply. An evolutionary algorithm is applied as a constraint satisfaction optimization tool to search for the optimal relay setting. This method can find out the best protection relay coordination that cannot be achieved by traditional methods. This is the most significant achievement.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference. Thirty-Forth IAS Annual Meeting (Cat.

The adaptive controller is constructed as a feedback signal (a predetermined control law), depending on estimated stator currents supplied by the neural estimators and the reference trajectories to be tracked by the output. The control of the direct and quadrature components of the stator current successfully tracked a wide variety of reference trajectories after relatively short, online training periods.

However, due to various complexities in these systems, the learning process may require a large amount of training data to obtain the exact dynamics of the system. To overcome this problem a novel NN based trajectory tracking controller is introduced which neither requires a priori knowledge of the dynamics nor learning of system dynamics. The proposed control scheme incorporates expert knowledge and is decentralized to deactivate the coupled dynamics associated with certain systems like robotic manipulators. The NN is employed to classify the system input-output measurements into several patterns depending on the displacement and velocity deviations from the respective desired trajectories. A proportional plus derivative gain control action is determined from a look-up table corresponding to the classification from the NN. Furthermore, an integrator is applied to enhance system performance. Several PD gains are introduced in a staggered format relative to the magnitudes of the displacement and velocity tracking errors, resulting in a controller that is robust to both structured and unstructured uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799175","startPage":"2380","endPage":"2385 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

An artificial neural network control scheme which uses continual on-line random training (with no off-line training) to simultaneously identify and adaptively control the speed of the stepper motor is proposed. The control scheme utilizes two three-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks: (1) a tracker identification neural network which captures the nonlinear dynamics of the motor over any arbitrary time interval in its range of operation and (2) a controller neural network to provide the necessary control actions to achieve trajectory tracking of the motor speed. The inputs to the controller neural network are not constructed from the actual motor/load dynamics, but as a feedback signal, from the estimated state variables of the motor supplied by the neural identifier and the reference trajectory to be tracked by the actual speed. This paper also makes use of a very realistic and practical scheme to estimate and adaptively learn the noise content in the speed-load torque characteristic of the motor. Simulations reveal that the neuro-controller adapts and generalizes its learning rate to a wide variety of loads, in addition to providing the necessary abstraction when measurements are contaminated with noise.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799176","startPage":"2386","endPage":"2392 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Square-wave fed permanent magnet motors yield a higher torque whereas the torque ripple of sine-wave fed brushless motors is significantly lower. An innovative topology of DC brushless motor with the stator phases being fed in series by means of a solid-state-commutator (SSC) is presented in this paper. The solid-state-commutator provides each motor phase with 180/spl deg/ square wave current timed with respective EMF. With a PM motor having 60/spl deg/ flat-top trapezoidal-wave EMF, the proposed novel configuration results in no torque ripple and higher average torque compared to conventional brushless DC motor drives with 120/spl deg/ square-wave current supply. The proposed drive arrangement is suitable for EV propulsion systems based an the use of wheel motors. The paper discusses the principle of operation of the proposed drive arrangement and shows experimental waveforms taken from a drive prototype.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799198","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

The drives utilize IGCT devices-new hard driven GTOs achieving unprecedented switching performance and effective PWM carrier frequencies up to 1 kHz. The converters use diodes formulated for soft recovery and efficient clamp snubbers to allow commutation of up to 4000 A. Under development is a 6600 V drive employing series connected IGCT elements to achieve up to a 20 MVA rating. These high performance drives, targeted at heavy-duty rolling mill applications, employ a DSP based three-level space vector modulation algorithm with active charge balance neutral point control. The drive system includes a high bandwidth feed forward synchronous motor control algorithm achieving unprecedented torque performance at these power levels. The PWM load converter is capable of achieving output frequencies up to 75 Hz. A mill resonance compensation algorithm has been developed to take advantage of the available torque response for mill stand control. The IGCT PWM source converter technology eliminates the need for the expensive VAr compensation and harmonic filtering required by cycloconverter main drives. The source converter controls feature synchronous reference frame current regulators that maintain a nominal unity power factor grid interface. The controls offer the opportunity to fix mill power quality issues by adding features such as VAr compensation, harmonic optimization, active damping of grid resonances, and flicker control.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1999.799212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17294","startPage":"2655","endPage":"2661 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Recently, there have been modifications applied to some of these old circuits to improve their performance. But these fixes require more switching devices and/or the addition of filters. A completely new method of medium-voltage power conversion based on the series connection of PWM-IGBT converter cells has overcome all of these difficulties without filters. In fact, the input current meets the most stringent requirements of IEEE-519 (1992), and no output current harmonic exceeds 1% of fundamental. Power factor above 95% at all load points and efficiency of 96% at full load are routinely attained. The distributed architecture of this new drive also provides fault tolerance and very high availability. The design and construction of this new drive is described, as well as the means by which it provides these outstanding performance characteristics. Field experience gathered from hundreds of operating units is also reviewed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A medium-voltage drive utilizing series-cell multilevel topology for outstanding power quality","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Our method consists of two parts. One is Gabor filtering on predefined fiducial points that could represent robust facial features from the original face image. The other is transforming the facial features into eigenspace by PCA, which is able to classify individual facial representations. Thus, the trained face model has some eigenvalues that can be derived from an ensemble matrix of given Gabor responses. In order to identify the faces, test images are also projected into eigenspace from the image space and compared to the trained face images in the same eigenspace. The basic idea of containing the PCA and Gabor filter is to overcome the shortcomings of PCA. When raw images were used as a matrix of PCA, the eigenspace cannot reflect the correlation of facial features well, because original face images have deformation due to in-plane, in-depth rotation and brightness and contrast variation. So, we have overcome these problems using Gabor filter responses as input. A Gabor filter has the robust characteristics of illumination and rotation. In addition, we confirmed the improvement of discrimination ability when Gabor responses had transferred to the space constructed by the principal components. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the remarkable improvement of recognition rate of 19% and 11% compared to conventional PCA method in SAIT dataset and Olivetti dataset respectively. Our method has the advantage in gallery DB size than the recognition method only using Gabor filter responses.","doi":"10.1109/RATFG.1999.799223","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Workshop on Recognition, Analysis, and Tracking of Faces and Gestures in Real-Time Systems.

The extension of Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ MIS capacitors below 0.15 /spl mu/m technology is considered to be difficult due to insufficient cell capacitance. It is widely accepted that the MIM capacitor using high dielectric constant material is inevitable for 0.15 /spl mu/m technology and beyond. Although many studies to use high dielectric material have been reported, those studies are not adequate for 0.15 /spl mu/m technology and beyond because most of the studies are either based on a simple capacitor module process or based on large feature size design rules.

In this regime, the most important issue is the soft breakdown (SBD) (Depas et al., 1996) which induces the \"B-mode\" stress induced leakage current (SILC) (Okada et al., 1994 and 1998; Okada and Kawasaki, 1995; Okada, 1997). Although Weir et al. (1997) reported that the SBD induces no significant degradation to a device, Wu et al. (1998) have recently reported that the oxide breakdown immediately leads to device failure for submicron short-channel-length devices, regardless of the SBD or the hard breakdown (HBD). These reports raise controversy on how to define the oxide lifetime in this regime. Needless to say, this problem also influences on the scaling limit of silicon dioxides as the gate dielectrics. This must be discussed from the perspective of the following two aspects: (i) oxide lifetime (reliability) (Stathis and DiMaria, 1998) and (ii) chip-level off-leakage current (standby power) due to the direct tunneling current (Lo et al., 1997; Timp et al, 1998). In this paper, we studied the degradation behaviour of 2.4 nm-thick thermal oxides before and after SBD. It was revealed that the limiting factor of the oxide lifetime is no longer the SBD nor HBD but the B-mode SILC in plural transistors induced by plural SBD.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Technology.

Device degradation due to bias-temperature instability (BTI) was studied. First, the stress voltage dependence of BTI results indicate that the direct-tunneling electron and/or hole transport does not play a major role in the degradation mechanism. Secondly, it was found that the threshold voltage change caused by BTI for the PMOSFET limits the device lifetime, which is shorter than that defined by hot-carrier induced degradation for the NMOSFET. It originates from the difference of supply voltage dependence between BTI and hot-carrier degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 1999","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6490108","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The impact of bias temperature instability for direct-tunneling ultra-thin gate oxide on MOSFET scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of bias temperature instability for direct-tunneling ultra-thin gate oxide on MOSFET scaling","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00799346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028867S","chronDate":"14-16 June 1999","isNumber":"17273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6461","citationCount":"120","articleId":"799346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799350,"authors":[{"name":"Changhong Dai","affiliation":["Logic Technology Development, Intel Corporation, USA"],"lastName":"Changhong Dai","id":"37269447300"},{"name":"N.

In sub-0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS and beyond, with continuous reduction in supply voltage, decrease in node capacitance, and increase in chip size and transistor count, alpha-SER has become a major reliability concern for logic products. As complex logic products such as microprocessors have numerous circuit types and sizes, accurate and efficient prediction of product SER by comprehending both microscopic charge collection physics and circuit response is both critical and a challenging task. This paper presents a comprehensive modeling and simulation approach, including: (1) circuit critical charge (Qcrit) simulation methodology, (2) compact model for alpha strike charge generation and collection, and (3) statistical algorithms for FIT (failure-in-time) rate simulation. We also present compact model calibration methods and validation using Lawrence Livermore National Lab alpha beams as well as experimentally measured FIT rates of SRAMs in three technology generations. This paper reports the alpha-SER saturation effect, which is extremely critical for future technology planning. Moreover, many of the concepts and models discussed here can be extended to neutron-SER prediction.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.1999.799350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17273","startPage":"81","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Technology.

None of the available commercial memories meet all of the properties of the ferroelectric memory. Although ferroelectric memory has inherent good properties, full utilization of these properties has not yet been realized. Commercially available products are limited to low densities. The commercially available ferroelectric memory uses a 2T2C (two transistor-two capacitor) structure with single level metal instead of a 1T1C (one transistor-one capacitor) structure with multiple metal layers which is believed to be essential for mega-bit or giga-bit density memory. In this paper, an integration technology for high performance and high density FRAMs is developed using a 1T1C robust capacitor in a COB (capacitor over bit line) structure with triple metallization processes. The technology developed in this paper is evaluated with an experimental 4 Mb FRAM, which is the highest FRAM density developed to date.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.1999.799383","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Symposium on VLSI Technology.

This deliberate introduction of input-dependent errors leads to degradation in the algorithmic performance, which is compensated for via algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) schemes. The resulting setup comprised of the DSP architecture operating at sub-critical voltage and the error control scheme is referred to as soft DSP. It is shown that technology scaling renders the proposed scheme more effective as the delay penalty suffered due to voltage scaling reduces due to short channel effects. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is also enhanced when arithmetic units with a higher \"delay-imbalance\" are employed. A prediction based error-control scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of the filtering algorithm in presence of errors due to soft computations. For a frequency selective filter, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides 60%-81% reduction in energy dissipation for filter bandwidths up to 0.5 /spl pi/ (where 2 /spl pi/ corresponds to the sampling frequency f/sub s/) over that achieved via conventional voltage scaling, with a maximum of 0.5 dB degradation in the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR/sub o/). It is also shown that the proposed algorithmic noise-tolerance schemes can be used to improve the performance of DSP algorithms in presence of bit-error rates of up to 10/sup -3/ due to deep submicron (DSM) noise.","doi":"10.1145/313817.313834","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

One of the problems for decoding turbo code in the receiver is the complexity and the high power consumption since multiple iterations of the Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm (SOVA) have to be carried out to decode a data frame. In this paper, we address the issues of reducing the complexity and power consumption of the turbo code decoder. An approach using cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) to adaptively terminate the SOVA iteration of each frame is presented. This results in system that has variable workload of which the amount of computation required for each data frame is different. Dynamic voltage scaling is then used to further reduce the power consumption. However, since the workload is not yet known at the time when the data is being decoded, optimum voltage assignment is not feasible. In this work, we propose two heuristic algorithms to assign supply voltage for different decoding iterations. Simulation results show that significant reduction of power consumption is achieved compared with a system using fixed supply voltage.","doi":"10.1145/313817.313836","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

This mechanism can provide the instruction stream to the data path and, when managed properly, it can effectively eliminate the need for high utilization of the more expensive I-Cache. In this work, we propose, implement, and evaluate a series of run-time techniques for dynamic analysis of the program instruction access behavior, which are then used to preactively guide the access of the LO-Cache. The basic idea is that only the most frequently executed portions of the code should be stored in the LO-Cache since this is where the program spends most of its time. We present experimental results to evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of performance and energy dissipation for a series of SPEC95 benchmarks. We also discuss the performance and energy tradeoffs that are involved in these dynamic schemes.","doi":"10.1145/313817.313856","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

One solution to achieve the ultra-low power requirement is to operate the digital logic gates in the subthreshold region. We analyze both CMOS and Pseudo-NMOS logic families operating in the subthreshold region. We compare the results with CMOS in the normal strong inversion region and with other known low-power logic, namely, energy recovery logic.

Simulation results for a 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process demonstrate that the buffer offers a low DC output impedance, a high degree of voltage regulation (output ripple of 12% of Vdd) and a superior line regulation (up to the maximum clock frequency of 50 MHz) even under strongly varying load conditions.

Gating can save power by both preventing unnecessary activity in the logic modules as well as by eliminating power dissipation in the clock distribution network. There is an inherent pitfall though in implementing gating groups for hierarchical gated clock distribution because the groups are typically developed at the logic level with no information of the physical layout of the clocktree. Depending on the distribution of underlying sinks, maintaining gating groups can cause a wiring overhead that is potentially greater than the savings due to reduced switching. We look at modifications of zero-skew tree algorithms to consider both the physical and logical aspects of hierarchical gating. The algorithms are applied to data taken from a low power ASIC design. The best gated clocktree is created using both physical and logical information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Aug. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799435/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6520203","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"17-17 Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Challenges in clockgating for a low power ASIC methodology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges in clockgating for a low power ASIC methodology","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00799435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029591S","chronDate":"17-17 Aug. 1999","isNumber":"17348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6499","citationCount":"11","articleId":"799435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":799437,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The enhanced simulator and software optimizations are used to study and optimize the power dissipation of Smart-Badge, a wearable system based on the ARM microprocessor developed by HP Laboratories. We found that standard compiler optimizations give less than 1% energy savings. Source code optimizations are capable of up to 90% energy savings.

Transistor threshold voltage (Vt) variation is one of the key limiters to Vdd scaling. Several adaptive body bias in schemes have been proposed earlier to reduce the impact of die-to-die Vt variation. Unfortunately, body bias degrades the short channel effect (SCE) in the MOSFET. As technology is scaled down, this adverse effect of body biasing poses an increasingly serious challenge to controlling SCE and results in worse within-die Vt variation. The scaling trends of body bias values required to reduce die-to-die Vt variations and the resulting increase in within-die Vt variation are presented across three different technology generations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of using adaptive body bias to compensate die-to-die Vt variation on within-die Vt variation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

A RF front-end and a power-amplifier (PA) designed for the 433 MHz European ISM band are presented. Both RF building blocks have been integrated in a standard 0.5 /spl mu/m digital CMOS process with 0.65 V threshold voltages. The front-end includes an LNA and a downconverter mixer. It achieves a total double sideband (DSB) noise figure of 9 dB, with a dynamic range of 85 dB for a 60 kHz bandwidth, while dissipating only 250 /spl mu/W at 1.2 V supply voltage. The PA includes two fully integrated class A stages together with an output class C amplifier.

These techniques, however, often degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we propose using a small instruction buffer, also called a loop cache, to save power. A loop cache has no address tag store. It consists of a direct-mapped data array and a loop cache controller. The loop cache controller knows precisely whether the next instruction request will hit in the loop cache, well ahead of time. As a result, there is no performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (Cat.

In this paper for the first time, a look-up table based adaptive predistortion scheme is proposed to enhance the ROF link linearity. An adaptive filter trains itself to generate table entries and no prior knowledge of link physical parameters is needed. When data is transmitted, each symbol is pre-distorted at the symbol rate to compensate channel distortion. Experimental and simulation results show excellent performance improvement. The power handling capability of the laser diode is the upper limit. This scheme can be further simplified if limited AM-AM distortion is allowed which does not significantly contribute to system degradation.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1999.799469","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing (PACRIM 1999).

Four auxiliary horizontal dipole antennas, configured in the form of two separate crosses, are used to form an adaptive system with the vertically polarized antennas (VPA) of a HFSWR system. The outputs of the horizontal dipoles are correlated with the summed output of the VPAs to cancel the interference component in the output of the VPAs. Two slightly different methods are used in the estimation of the correlation coefficients. The first method uses the samples at the far ranges of the radar. The second method uses the samples in the nearby range bins. The results of using the first method have been presented by Leong (see RADAR'97, IEE Conf., Edinburgh, Scotland, p.26-30, 1997). Here we present the results of using the second method. With the first method, the interference-plus-noise power (INP) is reduced by more than 13 dB, and the Bragg-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (BINR) increases by up to 21 dB. With the second method, the INP is reduced by more than 17 dB, and the BINR increases by up to 25 dB. Both sets of the results show that the adaptive techniques are effective in suppressing the skywave interference.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799494/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6497420","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive suppression of skywave interference in HF surface wave radar using auxiliary horizontal dipole antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive suppression of skywave interference in HF surface wave radar using auxiliary horizontal dipole antennas","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00799494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035134S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6507","citationCount":"4","articleId":"799494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":799500,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

Unlike the smaller circuits that have traditionally been targeted to FPGAs, these large systems often contain memory. Architectural support for the efficient implementation of memory in next-generation FPGAs is therefore crucial. In this paper, we will describe recent research into FPGA memory architectures. We seek to uncover not only the best architecture for the memory arrays themselves, but the best architecture for their interconnection, and the interconnection of the memory architecture to the rest of the FPGA. We also show how memory arrays that are not used to implement storage can be used to implement the logic parts of circuits very efficiently. Many of the early research results have already been used in commercial FPGAs; others are likely to be used in the future.","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing (PACRIM 1999).

However, the disadvantages are that traditional direct mapping implementation of high-radix butterfly element will required more complex multipliers and thus large silicon area will be consumed. In this paper, we proposed an efficient approach to realize the high radix butterfly process element. This approach employed pipelining techniques to cascade the paralleled multipliers and thus fewer complex multipliers are utilized to realize the radix-r butterfly element. This approach can achieve a good trade-off between speed and area in the design of high radix butterfly element.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1999.799577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1999.799577","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing (PACRIM 1999).

It is shown that the imperfect power control increases mean acquisition time substantially when the standard deviation of received power is above 1 dB. The results in this paper can be applied to the reverse link design of a CDMA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of power control error on PN acquisition performance for a code-division-multiple-access system","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing (PACRIM 1999).

The proposed framework, using biologically inspired neural networks, for robot motion planning with obstacle avoidance in a nonstationary environment is computationally efficient. The neural dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a simple shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley's (1952) membrane model. The real-time optimal robot motion is planned through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network that represents the dynamic environment.

We describe a broadband local access network consisting of small, densely spaced packet-switching nodes interconnected by focused free-space optical links in a multihop mesh arrangement. Each switch serves a client, which may be an office building (containing, for example, conventional PBXs and LANs), a picocellular base station, or both. It is the responsibility of our local access network to economically and reliably extend broadband local access service (perhaps OC-3 or OC-12 for building LANs and PBXs; perhaps several tens of megabits per second to base stations) from an infrastructure end office or fiber ring add/drop multiplexer without requiring the installation of new buried optical cabling. Computed is the capacity of the multihop mesh, defined to be the maximum number of virtual connections which can be delivered to the infrastructure access point such that, independent of the traffic distribution among clients, all quality of service guarantees are maintained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799621/","volume":"6","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6416880","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A broadband wireless access network based on mesh-connected free-space optical links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broadband wireless access network based on mesh-connected free-space optical links","sourcePdf":"00799621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068037S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"84","articleId":"799621","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799650,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper provides, in models, each of these design phases for the example of frequency synthesizers. During the design phase, fast models are needed to explore the design space. On the other hand, accurate nonlinear models are derived for the verification phase to simulate complex specifications, e.g., the oscillator's output phase noise.

These instants correspond to the instants of glottal closure for voiced speech. The method uses the properties of the global phase characteristics of minimum phase signals. Robustness of the method against noise and distortion is due to the fact that the average phase characteristics of a signal is determined mainly by the strength of the excitation impulse. The strength of excitation is determined by the energy of the residual error signal around the instant of excitation. We propose a measure for the strength of the excitation based on Frobenius norm of the differenced signal.

There are three basic ways to fuse data streams for taking a decision such as phoneme identification: data-to-decision, decision-to-decision, and data-to-data. This leads to four possible models for audiovisual speech recognition, that is direct identification in the first case, separate identification in the second one, and two variants of the third early integration case, namely dominant recoding or motor recoding. However, no systematic comparison of these models is available in the literature. We propose an implementation of these four models, and submit them to a benchmark test. For this aim, we use a noisy-vowel corpus tested on two recognition paradigms in which the systems are tested at noise levels higher than those used for learning. In one of these paradigms, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value is provided to the recognition systems, in the other it is not. We also introduce a new criterion for evaluating performances, based on transmitted information on individual phonetic features. In light of the compared performances of the four models with the two recognition paradigms, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these models, leading to proposals for data representation, fusion architecture, and control of the fusion process through sensor reliability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799688.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.799688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing models for audiovisual fusion in a noisy-vowel recognition task","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Sensor fusion","Noise level","System testing","Signal to noise ratio","Fuses","Streaming media","Benchmark testing","Performance evaluation","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise","speech recognition","audio-visual systems","sensor fusion","speech coding","video coding","data structures","identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audiovisual fusion models","noisy-vowel recognition","audiovisual speech recognition","video sensors","audio sensors","sensor fusion","phonetic identification","data streams fusion","phoneme identification","direct identification","separate identification","early integration","dominant recoding","motor recoding","benchmark test","noisy-vowel corpus","recognition paradigms","noise levels","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","phonetic features","data representation","fusion architecture","sensor reliability","video-speech workstation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Comparing models for audiovisual fusion in a noisy-vowel recognition task","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6421184","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing models for audiovisual fusion in a noisy-vowel recognition task","sourcePdf":"00799688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083046S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"44","articleId":"799688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":799689,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

We develop an approach that uses nonlinear transformations in the stochastic matching framework to compensate for acoustic mismatches. The functional form of the nonlinear transformation is modeled by neural networks. We develop a new technique to train neural networks using the generalized EM algorithm. This technique eliminates the need for stereo databases, which are difficult to obtain in practical applications. The new technique is data-driven and hence can be used under a wide variety of conditions without a priori knowledge of the environment. Using this technique, we show that we can provide improvement under various types of acoustic mismatch; in some cases a 72% reduction in word error rate is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/89.799689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","startPage":"643","endPage":"655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear compensation for stochastic matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear compensation for stochastic matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6421185","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear compensation for stochastic matching","sourcePdf":"00799689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052678S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"22","articleId":"799689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":799691,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Tzung Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Tzung Chien","id":"37269128300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"799691","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Testing","Bayesian methods","Statistics","Vocabulary","Pattern recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Robustness","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition","approximation theory","Bayes methods","statistical analysis","trees (mathematics)","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","speech recognition","online hierarchical transformation","HMM parameters","adaptive speech recognition","acoustical environment","observed adaptation data","hierarchical tree","HMM units","transformation parameters","HMM mixture components","approximate Bayesian estimate","refreshed prior statistics","current data block","speaker adaptation experiments","Mandarin syllables recognition","efficiency","adaptation data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/89.799691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799691.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online hierarchical transformation of hidden Markov models for speech recognition","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel framework of online hierarchical transformation of hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters for adaptive speech recognition.

In this paper, the transformation framework formulated according to the approximate Bayesian estimate, where the prior statistics and the transformation parameters can be jointly and incrementally refreshed after each consecutive adaptation data, is presented. Using this formulation, only the refreshed prior statistics and the current block of data are needed for online transformation. In a series of speaker adaptation experiments on the recognition of 408 Mandarin syllables, we examine the effects on constructing various types of hierarchical trees. The efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method on incremental adaptation of overall HMM units are also confirmed.

One approach for addressing these variations is to utilize front-end stress classification to direct a stress dependent recognition algorithm which separately models each speech production domain. This study proposes a new approach which combines stress classification and speech recognition functions into one algorithm. This is accomplished by generalizing the one-dimensional (1-D) hidden Markov model to an N-channel hidden Markov model (N-channel HMM). Here, each stressed speech production style under consideration is allocated a dimension in the N-channel HMM to model each perceptually induced stress condition. It is shown that this formulation better integrates perceptually induced stress effects for stress independent recognition. This is due to the sub-phoneme (state level) stress classification that is implicitly performed by the algorithm. The proposed N-channel stress independent HMM method is compared to a previously established one-channel stress dependent isolated word recognition system yielding a 73.8% reduction in error rate. In addition, an 82.7% reduction in error rate is observed compared to the common one-channel neutral trained recognition approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"N-channel hidden Markov models for combined stressed speech classification and recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.799692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799692.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799692/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"N-channel hidden Markov models for combined stressed speech classification and recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6421187","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"N-channel hidden Markov models for combined stressed speech classification and recognition","sourcePdf":"00799692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053518S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"48","articleId":"799692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":799693,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Ming","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Ji Ming","id":"37275945100"},{"name":"P.

This composition reduces the number of models to be estimated by higher than an order of magnitude and is therefore of great significance in relieving the data sparsity problem in triphone-based continuous speech recognition. The new framework is derived from Bayesian statistics, and represents an alternative to other triphone-by-composition techniques, particularly to the model-interpolation and quasitriphone approaches. The potential power of this new framework is explored by an implementation based on the hidden Markov modeling technique. It is shown that the new model structure includes the quasitriphone model as a special case, and leads to more efficient parameter estimation than the model-interpolation method. Phone recognition experiments show an increase in the accuracy over that obtained by comparable models.","doi":"10.1109/89.799693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","startPage":"678","endPage":"684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian approach for building triphone models for continuous speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian approach for building triphone models for continuous speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6421188","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian approach for building triphone models for continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00799693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140567S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"6","articleId":"799693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":799695,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

Because the map takes the unit circle to itself, its form is that of the transfer function of a first-order allpass filter. Since it is a first-order map, it preserves the model order of rational systems, making it a valuable frequency warping technique for use in audio filter design. A closed-form weighted-equation-error method is derived that computes the optimal mapping coefficient as a function of sampling rate, and the solution is shown to be generally indistinguishable from the optimal least-squares solution. The optimal Chebyshev mapping is also found to be essentially identical to the optimal least-squares solution. The expression 0.8517[arctan(0.06583fs)]/sup 1/2/-0.916 is shown to accurately approximate the optimal allpass coefficient as a function of sampling rate f/sub s/ in kHz for sampling rates greater than 1 kHz. A filter design example is included that illustrates improvements due to carrying out the design over a Bark scale. Corresponding results are also given and compared for approximating the related \"equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) scale\" of Moore and Glasberg (ACTA Acustica, vo.82, p.335-45, 1996) using a first-order allpass transformation. Due to the higher frequency resolution called for by the ERB scale, particularly at low frequencies, the first-order conformal map is less able to follow the desired mapping, and the error is two to three times greater than the Bark-scale case, depending on the sampling rate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17377/00799695.pdf","doi":"10.1109/89.799695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.799695","startPage":"697","endPage":"708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bark and ERB bilinear transforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799695/","displayDocTitle":"Bark and ERB bilinear transforms","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6421190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bark and ERB bilinear transforms","sourcePdf":"00799695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047775S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"181","articleId":"799695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799707,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Video system resolution is limited by the two-dimensional detector array used. High-resolution images are attainable, but typically with reduced imaging area. Recording to analog videotape has the added problem of introducing noise into the data. Unless the frame rate or instrument tow speed can be varied, particles are either missed or repetitively imaged, thereby making particle density calculations difficult or inaccurate. These methods also have the disadvantage of requiring time-consuming postprocessing of the data before the images can be analyzed on a computer.

There were lots of demos and pilot systems, but except for vehicle simulators and entertainment applications, VR was not yet in production use doing real work. This year he was invited to do an up-to-date assessment of VR, with funding to visit major centers in North America and Europe. Every one of the component technologies has made big strides. Moreover, I found that there now exist some VR applications routinely operated for the results they produce.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/17375/00799723.pdf","doi":"10.1109/38.799723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.799723","startPage":"16","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What's real about virtual reality?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov-Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov-Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799723/","displayDocTitle":"What's real about virtual reality?","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6404038","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2005","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What's real about virtual reality?","sourcePdf":"00799723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025609S","chronDate":"Nov-Dec 1999","isNumber":"17375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"288","articleId":"799723","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":799732,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Nonlinearities, which come from coupling effects between different motion modes of an AUV and also environmental effects, are very complicated and cannot be modeled easily by using conventional dynamics methods. In the paper, by implementation of a neural network identifier (NNI) a general idea for dynamic modeling of any six-degree of freedom rigid body is discussed, and then as an example, the proposed idea is applied to a four degree of freedom AUV system, named Twin Burger 2. This vehicle has four motion modes, called surge, sway, heave, and yaw. It is equipped with an inertial navigation system that can detect state variables of its motion. The NNI is made of two main parts. The first part is made of six independent single degree of freedom neural network identifiers (SDFNNI), which in the case of Twin Burger 2, is four. After training each independent SDFNNI, the second part or main part, named coupled model neural network identifier (CMNNI) is trained. In order to train all of the proposed neural network identifiers, a series of experiments were done and training data packs were collected. From the simulation results it can be seen that the proposed idea is satisfactorily able to identify dynamic behavior of the AUV system under consideration, and also it can be concluded that the proposed method will be useful for system identification of similar systems.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1999.799732","startPage":"201","endPage":"208 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '99.

Various circuit techniques are used for 1.9- and 3.3-V I/O buffers to ensure that the voltage across the gate oxide of every MOS element is below specified limits of 2.2 V for transient (short duty cycle) and 1.9 V for steady state. Only one PMOS pullup driver transistor between the bond pad and the power supply, and one NMOS pulldown driver transistor between the bond pad and ground, are used for the 1.9-V I/O buffer design, while cascoded MOS transistors between the bond pad and power supply or ground terminals are used for the 3.3-V I/O buffer design. The primary design goal is to ensure the reliability of MOS elements by avoiding excessive gate oxide stress due to high electric fields. However, due to differences in requirements for speed, power-supply voltage, and tristate leakage current, completely different circuit techniques have been used for the two designs.

Parallel decoding of four memory threshold voltage levels to 2-bit logical values prevents throughput degradation due to multilevel operation. This parallel decoding has been achieved by sense latches and data latches connected to each bitline. Tight distribution of memory cell threshold voltage is essential to reliable multilevel operation. This chip has several measures to deal with the factors that widen the memory cell V/sub th/. The effect of adjacent memory cell's V/sub th/ is eliminated by using an AND-type flash memory cell. An initial distribution width of 0.1 V is achieved. The wordline voltage, which has negative temperature dependency, compensates the positive dependency of memory cell V/sub th/. In the -5-75/spl deg/C range, memory threshold V/sub th/ deviation is reduced from the conventional 0.19-0.07 V. Conventionally, the number of programs without erase operation per one sector is limited by the limitations from program disturb. This chip introduced a new rewrite scheme, and this limit is increased from the conventional 10-2048+64 times/sector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","volume":"34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418531","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 256-Mb multilevel flash memory with 2-MB/s program rate for mass storage applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 256-Mb multilevel flash memory with 2-MB/s program rate for mass storage applications","sourcePdf":"00799861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040838S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"13","articleId":"799861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":799862,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Two key circuit techniques, a two-way metal cell-plate line and a cell-plate line shared with 16 cells, reduce cell-plate-line delay to 7 ns and reduce plate drive area to 1/5. The total cell-plate-line delay, including cell transistor delay due to eight cells in series, is reduced to 15 /spl mu/s, in contrast to 30-100-ns delay of the conventional FRAM. The die size is reduced to 86% that of the conventional FRAM by reduction of the plate driver area and sense amplifier area, assuming the same memory cell size. A prototype 16-kb chain FRAM chip was fabricated using 0.5 /spl mu/m rule one-polycide and two-metal CMOS process. The memory cell size was 13.26 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ using a 3.24-/spl mu/m/sup 2/ capacitor.

The 1-Gb SDRAM employs a hybrid bitline architecture with 512 cells/local-bitline (LBL). Four LBL pairs are connected through multiplexers to each sense amplifier (SA). Two of the LBL pairs are coupled to the SA by wiring over two other LBL pairs using hierarchical bitlines. This results in a reduction of the number of the SA's to 1/4, reducing the chip size by 6%. A hierarchical column-select-line scheme is incorporated with a hierarchical dataline (MDQ) architecture. This makes 16-bank organization possible while sharing hierarchical column decoders and second sense amplifiers. A hierarchical 8-b prefetch scheme employs four MDQ's for each read-write drive (RWD) and two RWD's for each DQ. This reduces the frequencies of the MDQ's and the RWD's to 1/8 and 1/2, respectively. A 1-V swing signaling on the RWD is used to reduce the burst current by 18 mA. The 1-V swing signaling is successfully converted to 2.1 V with self-timed first-in, first-out circuitry. The hardware data demonstrate 400-Mb/s/pin operation with a 16-mm TSOP-II package. Seamless burst operation at various frequencies has also been confirmed.

The core is a two-way superscalar MIPS-compatible microprocessor with 16-kB scratch-pad RAM.

The innovation here is to replace the EZWs dyadic wavelet transform by M-channel uniform-band maximally decimated LPPRFBs, which offer finer frequency spectrum partitioning and higher energy compaction. The transform stage can now be implemented as a block transform which supports parallel processing and facilitates region-of-interest coding/decoding. For hardware implementation, the transform boasts efficient lattice structures, which employ a minimal number of delay elements and are robust under the quantization of lattice coefficients. The resulting compression algorithm also retains all the attractive properties of the EZW coder and its variations such as progressive image transmission, embedded quantization, exact bit rate control, and idempotency. Despite its simplicity, our new coder outperforms some of the best image coders published previously in the literature, for almost all test images (especially natural, hard-to-code ones) at almost all bit rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A progressive transmission image coder using linear phase uniform filterbanks as block transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.799878","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17381/00799878.pdf","startPage":"1493","endPage":"1507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.799878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A progressive transmission image coder using linear phase uniform filterbanks as block transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420383","pubMedId":"18267425","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A progressive transmission image coder using linear phase uniform filterbanks as block transforms","sourcePdf":"00799878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063513S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"64","articleId":"799878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":799880,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The transition and emission/output probabilities from hidden states, as known from the HMMs, are conditioned on the past. This way, the HMM may be applied to images introducing the dependencies of the second dimension by conditioning. In this paper, the PHMM is extended to multiple sequences with a multiple token version and adaptive versions of PHMM coding are presented. The different versions of the PHMM are applied to lossless bilevel image coding. To reduce and optimize the model cost and size, the contexts are organized in trees and effective quantization of the parameters is introduced. The new coding methods achieve results that are better than the JBIG standard on selected test images, although at the cost of increased complexity. By the minimum description length principle, the methods presented for optimizing the code length may apply as guidance for training (P)HMMs for, e.g., segmentation or recognition purposes. Thereby, the PHMM models provide a new approach to image modeling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive partially hidden Markov models with application to bilevel image coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.799880","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17381/00799880.pdf","startPage":"1516","endPage":"1526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.799880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive partially hidden Markov models with application to bilevel image coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420385","pubMedId":"18267427","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive partially hidden Markov models with application to bilevel image coding","sourcePdf":"00799880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025588S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"5","articleId":"799880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":799882,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Zeng","affiliation":["Digital Video Department, Sharp Laboratories of America, Inc.orporated, Camas, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Wenjun Zeng","id":"37087337339"},{"name":"B.

Many of existing watermarking schemes focused on the robust means to mark an image invisibly without really addressing the ends of these schemes. This paper first discusses some scenarios in which many current watermarking schemes fail to resolve the rightful ownership of an image. The key problems are then identified, and some crucial requirements for a valid invisible watermark detection are discussed. In particular, we show that, for the particular application of resolving rightful ownership using invisible watermarks, it might be crucial to require that the original image not be directly involved in the watermark detection process. A general framework for validly detecting the invisible watermarks is then proposed. Some requirements on the claimed signature/watermarks to be used for detection are discussed to prevent the existence of any counterfeit scheme. The optimal detection strategy within the framework is derived. We show the effectiveness of this technique based on some visual-model-based watermark encoding schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6420387","pubMedId":"18267429","displayDocTitle":"A statistical watermark detection technique without using original images for resolving rightful ownerships of digital images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical watermark detection technique without using original images for resolving rightful ownerships of digital images","sourcePdf":"00799882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063175S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"126","articleId":"799882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":799885,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

Extended self-similar (ESS) processes were previously introduced in order to provide a generalization of fBm. These new processes are described by a number of multiscale Hurst parameters. In contrast to the single Hurst parameter, the extended parameters are able to characterize a greater variety of natural textures where the roughness of these textures is not necessarily scale-invariant. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of multiscale Hurst parameters as features for texture classification and segmentation. For texture classification, the performance of the generalized Hurst features is compared to traditional Hurst and Gabor features. Our experiments show that classification accuracy for the generalized Hurst and Gabor features are comparable even though the generalized Hurst features lower the dimensionality by a factor of five. Next, the segmentation accuracy using generalized and standard Hurst features is evaluated on images of texture mosaics. For these experiments, the performance is evaluated with and without supplemental contrast and average grayscale features. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of the Hurst features to segment real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.","doi":"10.1109/83.799885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.799885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17381","startPage":"1572","endPage":"1585","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17381/00799885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fractals","Image segmentation","Two dimensional displays","Brownian motion","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Surface texture","Electronic switching systems","Gray-scale","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brownian motion","image texture","image classification","image segmentation","fractals","synthetic aperture radar","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended fractal analysis","texture classification","segmentation","Hurst parameter","two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion","fBm","isotropic textured surfaces","roughness","extended self-similar processes","ESS processes","dimensionality","contrast feature","average grayscale feature","real synthetic aperture radar imagery","SAR imagery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extended fractal analysis for texture classification and segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420390","pubMedId":"18267432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799885/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended fractal analysis for texture classification and segmentation","sourcePdf":"00799885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03935S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"173","articleId":"799885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":799893,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This study reveals that neural networks are not only much simpler to use than the recalibration method, but that they are equal or better trend (variable term) predictors.

To handle nongesture patterns, we introduce the concept of a threshold model that calculates the likelihood threshold of an input pattern and provides a confirmation mechanism for the provisionally matched gesture patterns. The threshold model is a weak model for all trained gestures in the sense that its likelihood is smaller than that of the dedicated gesture model for a given gesture. Consequently, the likelihood can be used as an adaptive threshold for selecting proper gesture model. It has, however, a large number of states and needs to be reduced because the threshold model is constructed by collecting the states of all gesture models in the system. To overcome this problem, the states with similar probability distributions are merged, utilizing the relative entropy measure. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully extract trained gestures from continuous hand motion with 93.14% reliability.","doi":"10.1109/34.799904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17386/00799904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.799904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17386","startPage":"961","endPage":"973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An HMM-based threshold model approach for gesture recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An HMM-based threshold model approach for gesture recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6406665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An HMM-based threshold model approach for gesture recognition","sourcePdf":"00799904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026221S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"390","articleId":"799904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":799905,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The visual patterns are defined as the features which have the highest degree of alignment in the statistical structure across different frequency bands. The analysis reorganizes the image according to an invariance constraint in statistical structure and consists of three stages: pre-attentive stage, integration stage, and learning stage. The first stage takes the input image and performs filtering with log-Gabor filters. Based on their responses, activated filters which are selectively sensitive to patterns in the image are short listed. In the integration stage, common grounds between several activated sensors are explored. The filtered responses are analyzed through a family of statistics. For any given two activated filters, a distance between them is derived via distances between their statistics. The third stage performs cluster partitioning for learning the subspace of log-Gabor filters needed to partition the image data. The clustering is based on a dissimilarity measure intended to highlight scale and orientation invariance of the responses. The technique is illustrated on real and simulated data sets. Finally, this paper presents a computational visual distinctness measure computed from the image representational model based on visual patterns.

Face recognition using multiple views in the viewing sphere is a more difficult task since face rotations out of the imaging plane can introduce occlusion of facial structures. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based face recognition algorithm that uses a set of random rectilinear line segments of 2D face image views as the underlying image representation, together with a nearest-neighbor classifier as the line matching scheme. The combination of 1D line segments exploits the inherent coherence in one or more 2D face image views in the viewing sphere. The algorithm achieves high generalization recognition rates for rotations both in and out of the plane, is robust to scaling, and is computationally efficient. Results show that the classification accuracy of the algorithm is superior compared with benchmark algorithms and is able to recognize test views in quasi-real-time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line-based face recognition under varying pose","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.799912","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17386/00799912.pdf","startPage":"1081","endPage":"1088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.799912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Line-based face recognition under varying pose","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6406673","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line-based face recognition under varying pose","sourcePdf":"00799912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035975S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"40","articleId":"799912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799930,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Various flavors of empirical study may be used to help with this task, including surveys, case studies, and experiments. Little guidance is available within the software engineering community to help choose among these alternatives when assessing a new and evolving software development technique within some cost bounds. We faced this challenge when assessing a new programming technique called aspect-oriented programming. To assess the technique, we chose to apply both a case study approach and a series of four experiments because we wanted to understand and characterize the kinds of information that each approach might provide. We describe and critique the evaluation methods we employed, and discuss the lessons we have learned. These lessons are applicable to other researchers attempting to assess new programming techniques that are in an early stage of development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6419043","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating emerging software development technologies: lessons learned from assessing aspect-oriented programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating emerging software development technologies: lessons learned from assessing aspect-oriented programming","sourcePdf":"00799936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052932S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"20","articleId":"799936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":799939,"authors":[{"name":"V.R.

One reason is that there are a large number of context variables and, so, creating a cohesive understanding of experimental results requires a mechanism for motivating studies and integrating results. It requires a community of researchers that can replicate studies, vary context variables, and build models that represent the common observations about the discipline. The paper discusses the experience of the authors, based upon a collection of experiments, in terms of a framework for organizing sets of related studies. With such a framework, experiments can be viewed as part of common families of studies, rather than being isolated events. Common families of studies can contribute to important and relevant hypotheses that may not be suggested by individual experiments. A framework also facilitates building knowledge in an incremental manner through the replication of experiments within families of studies. To support the framework, the paper discusses the experiences of the authors in carrying out empirical studies, with specific emphasis on persistent problems encountered in experimental design, threats to validity, criteria for evaluation, and execution of experiments in the domain of software engineering.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software engineering","Buildings","Design for experiments","Testing","Computer science","Mathematical model","Computer Society","Context modeling","Organizing","Software measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software engineering experimentation","studies","knowledge building","empirical studies","experimental design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=799939","doi":"10.1109/32.799939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/17384/00799939.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.799939","startPage":"456","endPage":"473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building knowledge through families of experiments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Building knowledge through families of experiments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","accessionNumber":"6419044","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building knowledge through families of experiments","sourcePdf":"00799939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075548S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"479","articleId":"799939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":799941,"authors":[{"name":"E.C.

Cost-optimized designs for IPM machines and combined machine-inverter systems are compared for an automotive starter/alternator application. The optimization is performed twice, once with a linear lumped parameter model, and again using a nonlinear saturating model. The saturating model produces cost-optimized IPM machines that have lower saliency ratios, larger volumes, and more magnet material than the linear nonsaturating designs, but the saturating model designs are electromagnetically realizable unlike the linear model designs. The inclusion of inverter cost in the drive cost optimization has a significant impact on the machine design, exchanging a larger and more expensive machine for lower power electronics costs made possible by reduced inverter current.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1999.799941","startPage":"125","endPage":"131 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

In this environment, the role of careful empirical studies as the basis for improving software maintenance processes, methods, and tools is highlighted. One of the most important processes that merits empirical evaluation is software evolution. Software evolution refers to the dynamic behaviour of software systems as they are maintained and enhanced over their lifetimes. Software evolution is particularly important as systems in organizations become longer-lived. However, evolution is challenging to study due to the longitudinal nature of the phenomenon in addition to the usual difficulties in collecting empirical data. We describe a set of methods and techniques that we have developed and adapted to empirically study software evolution. Our longitudinal empirical study involves collecting, coding, and analyzing more than 25000 change events to 23 commercial software systems over a 20-year period. Using data from two of the systems, we illustrate the efficacy of flexible phase mapping and gamma sequence analytic methods, originally developed in social psychology to examine group problem solving processes. We have adapted these techniques in the context of our study to identify and understand the phases through which a software system travels as it evolves over time. We contrast this approach with time series analysis. Our work demonstrates the advantages of applying methods and techniques from other domains to software engineering and illustrates how, despite difficulties, software evolution can be empirically studied.","doi":"10.1109/32.799945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17384","startPage":"493","endPage":"509","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/17384/00799945.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.799945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical approach to studying software evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software maintenance","Software systems","Time series analysis","Software engineering","Dynamic programming","Psychology","Problem-solving","Costs","Software performance","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software prototyping","software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["empirical approach","software evolution","software engineering","empirical studies","software maintenance processes","dynamic behaviour","longitudinal nature","empirical data","change events","commercial software systems","flexible phase mapping","gamma sequence analytic methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","displayDocTitle":"An empirical approach to studying software evolution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/799945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6419046","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical approach to studying software evolution","sourcePdf":"00799945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045207S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1999","isNumber":"17384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"180","articleId":"799945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":799946,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

This added focus has added a new layer of complexity to an already challenging area of research. Along with new research questions, new research methods are needed to study nontechnical aspects of software engineering. In many other disciplines, qualitative research methods have been developed and are commonly used to handle the complexity of issues involving human behaviour. The paper presents several qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and describes them in terms of how they might be incorporated into empirical studies of software engineering, in particular how they might be combined with quantitative methods.

The functionality of the chip includes preheating, self-protection, over- and undervoltage protection, temperature-protection, low temperature detection for increased preheating time, dimming or power control, by changing the supply voltage up to 50%, and an input-voltage independent power control of the lamp. The solution offers possibilities for applications with a reduced input charging capacitor for lower line voltages, or for bootstrap circuitry to achieve a high power factor up to 0.9, universal input, voltage- and capacity-reduced charging capacitors, and inrush-current limiting. A smart-power IC with a low voltage control part, a single 1200 V DMOS transistor, and only 5 pins, gives the possibility of low cost solutions in the future, e.g. with new power technologies like the Cool-Mos technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Fluorescence","Fluorescent lamps","Low voltage","Voltage control","Power control","Capacitors","Electronic ballasts","Protection","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluorescent lamps","lamp accessories","power integrated circuits","power control","voltage control","SIMOX","power convertors","lighting control","power factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-transistor smart-power IC","fluorescent lamp ballast","single-chip class-E converter","SIMOX technology","DMOS transistor","low voltage control","compact fluorescent lamps","fluorescent lamps","preheating","self-protection","undervoltage protection","overvoltage protection","temperature-protection","low temperature detection","dimming","power control","supply voltage control","input-voltage independent power control","reduced input charging capacitor","lower line voltages","bootstrap circuitry","high power factor","capacity-reduced charging capacitors","voltage-reduced charging capacitors","inrush-current limiting","smart-power IC","Cool-Mos technology","1200 V","15 W"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799966","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

However, they are different in the instantaneous active and reactive power in each phase if a zero-sequence voltage and current are included in a three-phase four-wire system. Theory and computer simulations in this paper lead to the following conclusions: an active filter without energy storage components can fully compensate for the neutral current even in a three-phase four-wire system including a zero-sequence voltage and current, when a proposed control strategy based on the original theory is applied. However, the active filter cannot compensate for the neutral current fully, when an already-proposed control strategy based on the modified theory is applied.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.799991","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.
