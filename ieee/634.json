To realize higher-speed wireless communication while maintaining low power consumption for mobile application, however, a short-millimeter-wave band (more than 100 GHz) is used since it can potentially provide a wider frequency band. Thus, we have studied D-band (110 - 170 GHz) CMOS circuits to realize low-power ultrahigh-speed wireless communication. In the short-millimeter-wave band, since only an insufficient device model is provided, research has to start from device modeling. In this paper, our studies of modeling and design for D-band CMOS circuits are described. Finally, a 10 Gbps, 135 GHz wireless transceiver with a power consumption of 98 mW is demonstrated.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340039/6340047/06340062.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2012.6340062","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2012.6340062","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340062","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS integrated circuits","Receivers","Delay","Wireless communication","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","integrated circuit design","mobile radio","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-millimeter-wave CMOS design","short-distance high-speed wireless communication","mobile application","low-power ultrahigh-speed wireless communication","device modeling","D-band CMOS circuit design","wireless transceiver","frequency 60 GHz","frequency 110 GHz to 170 GHz","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","power 98 mW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340062/","displayDocTitle":"Short-Millimeter-Wave CMOS Design for Ultrahigh-Speed Wireless Communication","accessionNumber":"13101410","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6340062/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Millimeter-Wave CMOS Design for Ultrahigh-Speed Wireless Communication","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1141486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069395S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340039","isNumber":"6340047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340039","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6340047","articleId":"6340062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6340065,"authors":[{"name":"Valiallah Zomorrodian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Valiallah","lastName":"Zomorrodian","id":"37542679500"},{"name":"Umesh K.

Both amplifier circuits have been realized using a 35 nm InAlAs/InGaAs based metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (mHEMT) technology in combination with a benzocyclobutene (BCB) encapsulation to minimize the device parasitics. Furthermore, airbridge type transmission lines (ABTL) and grounded coplanar circuit topology (GCPW) were applied, leading to a compact chip size and excellent gain performance in the submillimeter-wave frequency regime beyond 500 GHz. A realized six-stage ABTL amplifier circuit demonstrated a small-signal gain of more than 20 dB between 502 and 516 GHz, while a six-stage grounded coplanar TMIC achieved a linear gain of 20.3 dB at 610 GHz and more than 18 dB over the bandwidth from 557 to 616 GHz.

The resulting topology is called the Dual (Multi) Output Stacked Class-EE PA. Two Q-band prototypes - a unit cell with 2 devices stacked, and a power-combined version employing two such unit cells - have been fabricated in IBM's 45nm SOI CMOS technology using the 56nm body-contacted devices. Measurements yield a peak PAE of 25.5% for the Dual Output Stacked Class-EE unit cell with saturated output power of 17.9 dBm, and a peak PAE >;16% for the power-combined version with saturated output power >;19.1 dBm.

The first one is XP-style small-step refactoring, also called floss refactoring. The other tactic, called root canal refactoring, is to set aside an extended period specially for refactoring. Floss refactoring, as one of the corner stones of XP, is well acknowledged. In contrast, root canal refactoring is doubted, especially by XP advocators. Despite the doubts, however, no large scale empirical study on refactoring tactics has been reported. In contrast to the doubts, cases of root canal refactoring have been reported from industry, e.g., Microsoft. Researchers from academe have also proposed various approaches to facilitating root canal refactoring. To this end, this paper would investigate the following questions. (1)How often are the two different tactics employed, respectively? (2) Is there any correlation between refactoring tactics and categories of refactorings? In other words, are some kinds of refactorings more likely than others to be done as floss refactorings or root canal refactorings? To answer these questions, we analyze refactoring histories collected by Eclipse Usage Data Collector (UDC). The data are collected from 753,367 engineers worldwide. Analysis results suggest that about 11.5 percent of refactorings collected by UDC are root canal refactorings, whereas others (88.5 percent) are floss refactorings. We also find that some kinds of refactorings, e.g., Introduce Parameter, are more likely than others to be performed as root canal refactorings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Initial Study on Refactoring Tactics","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.31","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340121/6340122/06340145.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"An Initial Study on Refactoring Tactics","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340145/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13118063","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Initial Study on Refactoring Tactics","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4736a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077651S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340121","isNumber":"6340122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6340122","articleId":"6340145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6340188,"authors":[{"name":"William R Claycomb","affiliation":["CERT Program Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"William R","lastName":"Claycomb","id":"38510599300"},{"name":"Alex Nicoll","affiliation":["CERT Program Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Nicoll","id":"37841126800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1990-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4736-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"6340188","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1866},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Servers","Electronic mail","Companies","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insider threat","cloud computing","security","cloud-related insider risk","cloud-related vulnerability","information stealing","cloud systems architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["insider","cloud","security"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing related insider threats are often listed as a serious concern by security researchers, but to date this threat has not been thoroughly explored. We believe the fundamental nature of current insider threats will remain relatively unchanged in a cloud environment, but the paradigm does reveal new exploit possibilities. The common notion of a cloud insider as a rogue administrator of a service provider is discussed, but we also present two additional cloudrelated insider risks: the insider who exploits a cloud-related vulnerability to steal information from a cloud system, and the insider who uses cloud systems to carry out an attack on an employer's local resources. We also characterize a hierarchy of administrators within cloud service providers, give examples of attacks from real insider threat cases, and show how the nature of cloud systems architectures enables attacks to succeed. Finally, we discuss our position on future cloud research.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340121/6340122/06340188.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insider Threats to Cloud Computing: Directions for New Research Challenges","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Insider Threats to Cloud Computing: Directions for New Research Challenges","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13118103","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6340188/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insider Threats to Cloud Computing: Directions for New Research Challenges","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4736a387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071376S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340121","isNumber":"6340122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340121","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6340122","articleId":"6340188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6340189,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbo Zhang","affiliation":["Technology Center of Software Engineering, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536601500"},{"name":"Xiang Huang","affiliation":["Technology Center of Software Engineering, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37678263000"},{"name":"Ningjiang Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer, Electronic and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Ningjiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069062500"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Technology Center of Software Engineering, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37061299100"},{"name":"Hua Zhong","affiliation":["Technology Center of Software Engineering, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37530713100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1990-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4736-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"6340189","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":911},"abstract":"PaaS is one of the most popular paradigms of cloud computing and the performance guarantee of PaaS-oriented applications has been critically concerned. Performance models, such as a Layer Queue Network (LQN) model, are efficient at performance guaranteeing in a highly dynamic computing environment for their capabilities of capacity planning. However, it is not a trivial work to build and employ such models for a PaaS platform because of the lack of designs and the transaction-intensive feature of the PaaS-oriented applications. In this paper, a PaaS-oriented performance modeling approach is proposed. The LQN model of the PaaS-oriented application can be dynamically built through tracing their interactions with the PaaS platform. And the CPU consumptions, which are important to the accuracy of the LQN model, can be refined through a Kalman-filter method. A modeling tool is implemented and experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340121/6340122/06340189.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"404","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340122","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PaaS-Oriented Performance Modeling for Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Servers","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","feature extraction","Kalman filters","queueing theory","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PaaS-oriented performance modeling","cloud computing","PaaS-oriented applications","dynamic computing environment","capacity planning","transaction-intensive feature","PaaS-oriented applications","LQN model","CPU consumptions","LQN model","Kalman filter method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing; PaaS; Performance modeling; Kalman-filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"PaaS-Oriented Performance Modeling for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340189/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13118104","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PaaS-Oriented Performance Modeling for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4736a395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093595S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340121","isNumber":"6340122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6340122","articleId":"6340189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6340202,"authors":[{"name":"Burak \u00c7iflikli","affiliation":["STM, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Burak","lastName":"\u00c7iflikli","id":"38496581500"},{"name":"Onur \u00d6zcan","affiliation":["STM, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"\u00d6zcan","id":"37089141077"},{"name":"Ahmet Bora Uysal","affiliation":["STM, Inc., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet Bora","lastName":"Uysal","id":"38511806600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1990-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4736-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"6340202","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340202","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Command and control systems","Object oriented modeling","Computer architecture","Organizations","Software systems","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["command and control systems","software process improvement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven software development","military command and control systems","MDSD","software industry","platform independent solutions","software development process automation","design principles improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["military command and control","model driven software development","platform independence"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, Model Driven Software Development (MDSD) became new trend in software industry shifting the focus toward problem domain, supporting platform independent solutions and automating software development process.

Performance profiling has long been proved to be an effective approach to performance analysis; however, existing approaches do not consider two new requirements that emerge in cloud computing systems. First, the efficiency of the profiling becomes of critical concern; second, visual analytics should be utilized to make profiling results more readable. To address the above two issues, in this paper, we present P-Tracer, an online performance profiling approach specifically tailored for large-scale cloud computing systems. P-Tracer constructs a specific search engine that adopts a proactive way to process performance logs and generates particular indices for fast queries; furthermore, PTracer provides users with a suite of web-based interfaces to query statistical information of all kinds of services, which helps them quickly and intuitively understand system behavior. The approach has been successfully applied in Alibaba Cloud Computing Inc. to conduct online performance profiling both in production clusters and test clusters. Experience with one real-world case demonstrates that P-Tracer can effectively and efficiently help users conduct performance profiling and localize the primary causes of performance anomalies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13118120","htmlLink":"/document/6340205/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"P-Tracer: Path-Based Performance Profiling in Cloud Computing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P-Tracer: Path-Based Performance Profiling in Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4736a509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072722S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340121","isNumber":"6340122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6340122","articleId":"6340205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340251,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068575500"},{"name":"Wenbo Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536601500"},{"name":"Jun Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279094100"},{"name":"Hua Zhong","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37530713100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1990-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4736-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-3157"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0730-3157"}],"articleNumber":"6340251","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Vectors","Clustering algorithms","Pattern recognition","Extraterrestrial measurements","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","pattern clustering","security of data","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workload-aware online anomaly detection","enterprise application","local outlier factor","reliability","dynamic workload fluctuation","system metrics","metric correlations","workload pattern recognition","incremental clustering algorithm","LOF","TPC-W benchmark","fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Enterprise Applications","Local Outlier Factor","Workload Characterization"]}],"abstract":"Detecting anomalies are essential for improving the reliability of enterprise applications. Current approaches set thresholds for metrics or model correlations between metrics, and anomalies are detected when the thresholds are violated or the correlations are broken. However, we have found that the dynamic workload fluctuating over multiple time scales causes system metrics and their correlations to change. Moreover, it is difficult to model various metric correlations in complex applications. This paper addresses these problems and proposes an online anomaly detection approach for enterprise applications. A method is presented for recognizing workload patterns with an incremental clustering algorithm. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) based on the specific workload pattern is adopted for detecting anomalies. Our approach is evaluated on a testbed running the TPC-W benchmark. The experimental results show that our approach can capture workload fluctuations accurately and detect the typical faults effectively.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.12","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340121/6340122/06340251.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Workload-Aware Online Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Applications with Local Outlier Factor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340251/","displayDocTitle":"Workload-Aware Online Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Applications with Local Outlier Factor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13118147","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340251/","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Workload-Aware Online Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Applications with Local Outlier Factor","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4736a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097984S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340121","isNumber":"6340122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6340122","articleId":"6340251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340307,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We analyze the device characteristics of HIBT FETs with Si S/D and GaP channel for different values of band offsets. We show that, due to intra-band tunneling, HIBT FETs exhibit lower on current at iso-off current compared to Si double gate (DG) MOSFETs. However, the energy band offset at the S/D-channel interface leads to 40%-59% lower drain-induced barrier lowering/thinning and significantly reduced variation in off current across a range of supply voltages (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n).

The challenges that need to be addressed toward reaching such a computational system include building a compact massively parallel architecture with scalable interconnection devices, ultralow-power consumption, and robust neuromorphic computational schemes for implementation of learning in hardware. In this paper, we discuss programming strategies, material characteristics, and spike schemes, which enable implementation of symmetric and asymmetric synaptic plasticity with devices using phase-change materials. We demonstrate that energy consumption can be optimized by tuning the device operation regime and the spike scheme. Our simulations illustrate that a crossbar array consisting of synaptic devices and neurons can achieve hippocampus-like associative learning with symmetric synapses and sequence learning with asymmetric synapses. Pattern completion for patterns with 50% missing elements is achieved via associative learning with symmetric plasticity. Robustness of learning against input noise, variation in sensory data, and device resistance variation are investigated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2012.2217146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6353354/06340321.pdf","startPage":"3489","endPage":"3494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2217146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Energy Robust Neuromorphic Computation Using Synaptic Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-Energy Robust Neuromorphic Computation Using Synaptic Devices","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136111","htmlLink":"/document/6340321/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Energy Robust Neuromorphic Computation Using Synaptic Devices","sourcePdf":"ted-kuzum-2217146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128462S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6353354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6353354","articleId":"6340321","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6340322,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Christ","affiliation":["Foundation for Research on Information Technologies in Society, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6497105/6340322/6340322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Christ was born in Offenbach, Germany, in 1968.

Meanwhile, the UWB PD radar employs a carrier-based transceiver and a novel equivalent time sampling scheme based on FPGA for narrow pulse digitization. Highly integrated compact data acquisition hardware has been implemented and exploited in both radar prototypes. Typically, the CW Doppler radar is a low-cost option for single human activity monitoring, vital sign detection, etc., where target range information is not required. Meanwhile, the UWB PD radar is more advanced in through-wall sensing, multiple-object detection, real-time target tracking, and so on, where a high-resolution range profile is acquired together with a micro-Doppler signature.

The main advantages of the tested controller are simplicity and a reduced number of parameters for selection in the design process. Several stages of the real implementation are described. The two-mass drive system is modeled using the main processor of the cRIO, to emulate the real system, while the structure of the ADALINE model and its adaptation law are implemented in the FPGA module. Thus, hardware in the loop simulation is obtained.

Massey showed that a simple function of the Shannon entropy of the distribution from which the password is selected is a lower bound on the expected number of guesses, but one which is not tight in general. In a series of subsequent papers under ever less restrictive stochastic assumptions, an asymptotic relationship as password length grows between scaled moments of the guesswork and specific R\u00e9nyi entropy was identified. Here, we show that, when appropriately scaled, as the password length grows, the logarithm of the guesswork satisfies a large deviation principle (LDP), providing direct estimates of the guesswork distribution when passwords are long. The rate function governing the LDP possesses a specific, restrictive form that encapsulates underlying structure in the nature of guesswork. Returning to Massey's original observation, a corollary to the LDP shows that expectation of the logarithm of the guesswork is the specific Shannon entropy of the password selection process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6413249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6413249/06340341.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2219036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2219036","startPage":"796","endPage":"802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guesswork, Large Deviations, and Shannon Entropy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340341/","displayDocTitle":"Guesswork, Large Deviations, and Shannon Entropy","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340341/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13234736","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guesswork, Large Deviations, and Shannon Entropy","sourcePdf":"tit-duffy-2219036-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086155S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6413249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6413249","articleId":"6340341","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340343,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin G.

Observability properties of the error states in the low-cost integration navigation system are first analyzed, indicating that the attitude estimation is severely affected by vehicle maneuvers, particularly the yaw angle. The pitch and roll angles are strongly observed; hence, the observability of these two angles is nearly free of influence caused by vehicle maneuvers, and these two angles can be accurately estimated. To improve the yaw-angle estimation, we propose a cascaded Kalman filter to deal with the yaw angle separately with the aid of the GPS-measured course angle. Additionally, two switching rules are established to remove the influence caused by the sideslip angle and GPS noise. The experimental results validate the observability analysis of the low-cost INS/GPS system and show that the proposed attitude estimation method can effectively improve the accuracy of the vehicle attitude estimation, suggesting that this technique is a viable candidate for many control applications used in cars.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Observability","Vehicles","Vectors","Acceleration","Accuracy","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude control","Global Positioning System","inertial navigation","Kalman filters","observability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accuracy improvement","vehicle attitude estimation method","low-cost INS integration","low-cost GPS integration","GPS-measured course angle","global positioning system","low-cost integration navigation system","error states","low-cost inertial navigation system","pitch angles","roll angles","vehicle maneuvers","yaw-angle estimation","cascaded Kalman filter","sideslip angle","GPS noise","observability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attitude estimation","inertial navigation system and global positioning system integration (INS/GPS)","Kalman filter","observability analysis","sideslip angle"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2012.2224343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6521414/06340344.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6521414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2012.2224343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Accuracy of the Vehicle Attitude Estimation for Low-Cost INS/GPS Integration Aided by the GPS-Measured Course Angle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Accuracy of the Vehicle Attitude Estimation for Low-Cost INS/GPS Integration Aided by the GPS-Measured Course Angle","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340344/","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340344/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13529316","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Accuracy of the Vehicle Attitude Estimation for Low-Cost INS/GPS Integration Aided by the GPS-Measured Course Angle","sourcePdf":"tits-wu-2224343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083117S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6521414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6521414","articleId":"6340344","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6340348,"authors":[{"name":"Erik J.

These storage systems can capitalize on the high specific energy of Lithium-Ion batteries and the high specific power of modern ultracapacitors. The new predictive algorithm uses a state-based approach inspired by power systems optimization, organized as a probability-weighted Markov process to predict future load demands. Decisions on power sharing are made in real time, based on the predictions and probabilities of state trajectories along with associated system losses. Detailed simulations comparing various power sharing algorithms are presented, along with converter-level simulations presenting the response characteristics of power sharing scenarios. The full hybrid storage system along with the mechanical drivetrain is implemented and validated experimentally on a 500 W, 50 V system with a programmable drive cycle having a strong regenerative component. It is experimentally shown that the hybrid energy storage system runs more efficiently and captures the excess regenerative energy that is otherwise dissipated in the mechanical brakes due to the battery's limited charge current capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13244988","htmlLink":"/document/6340349/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Algorithm for Optimizing Power Flow in Hybrid Ultracapacitor/Battery Storage Systems for Light Electric Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Algorithm for Optimizing Power Flow in Hybrid Ultracapacitor/Battery Storage Systems for Light Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-laldin-2226474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085868S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6415310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6415310","articleId":"6340349","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":6340350,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Lemmon","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lemmon","id":"38236518600"},{"name":"Michael Mazzola","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mazzola","id":"37317536200"},{"name":"James Gafford","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Gafford","id":"37659625000"},{"name":"Chris Parker","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Parker","id":"37648637700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6340350","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1658},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Logic gates","Switches","Capacitance","Silicon carbide","Resistance","FETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistors","power electronics","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very low intrinsic capacitance","on-resistance","FET","power electronics applications","half-bridge configuration","switch turn-off","oscillator design theory","stability considerations","field-effect transistors","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FETs","oscillation","resonance","shoot-through","silicon carbide"]}],"abstract":"Owing to their very low intrinsic capacitance and on-resistance, silicon carbide FETs have been shown to produce poor dynamics in certain power electronics applications, particularly those based on the half-bridge configuration.

The fault diagnostic method takes advantage only of the control variables used for maximum power point tracking and output dc-link capacitor voltage balance. The fault-tolerant strategy requires only a few components added to the original three-level boost converter, so that, under an open-circuit power switch fault, it can be partly reconfigured into a two-level boost converter ensuring battery energy supply.

The proposed DA-based design uses a novel look-up table (LUT)-sharing technique for the computation of filter outputs and weight-increment terms of BLMS algorithm. Besides, it offers significant saving of adders which constitute a major component of DA-based structures. Also, we have suggested a novel LUT-based weight updating scheme for BLMS algorithm, where only one set of LUTs out of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n sets need to be modified in every iteration, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n=\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ML</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n, and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n are, respectively, the filter length and input block-size. Based on the proposed DA formulation, we have derived a parallel architecture for the implementation of BLMS adaptive digital filter (ADF). Compared with the best of the existing DA-based LMS structures, proposed one involves nearly \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sup>\n/\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sub>\n times adders and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n times LUT words, and offers nearly \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n times throughput of the other. It requires nearly 25% more flip-flops and does not involve variable shifters like those of existing structures. It involves less LUT access per output (LAPO) than the existing structure for block-size higher than 4. For block-size 8 and filter length 64, the proposed structure involves 2.47 times more adders, 15% more flip-flops, 43% less LAPO than the best of existing structures, and offers 5.22 times higher throughput. The number of adders of the proposed structure does not increase proportionately with block size; and the number of flip-flops is independent of block-size. This is a major advantage of the proposed structure for reducing its area delay product (ADP); particularly, when a large order ADF is implemented for higher block-sizes. ASIC synthesis result shows that, the proposed structure for filter length 64, has almost 14% and 30% less ADP and 25% and 37% less EPO than the best of the existing structures for block size 4 and 8, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance Energy-Efficient Architecture for FIR Adaptive Filter Based on New Distributed Arithmetic Formulation of Block LMS Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2226453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6417036/06340356.pdf","startPage":"921","endPage":"932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2226453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6417036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance Energy-Efficient Architecture for FIR Adaptive Filter Based on New Distributed Arithmetic Formulation of Block LMS Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6340356/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13251070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance Energy-Efficient Architecture for FIR Adaptive Filter Based on New Distributed Arithmetic Formulation of Block LMS Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tsp-mohanty-2226453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121193S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6417036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6417036","articleId":"6340356","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340357,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6417036/6340357/6340357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Wang received the B.S. degree from Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China, in 2006 and the M.S. degree from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2009, both in electronic engineering.

The fundamental problem in the considered network is the design of transmission strategies at the secondary node. It involves three basic elements: first, how to split the power for relaying the primary signals and for transmitting the secondary signals; second, what two-way relay strategy should be used to assist the bidirectional communication between the two PUs; third, how to jointly design the primary and secondary transmit precoders. This work aims to address this problem by proposing a transmission framework of maximizing the achievable rate of the SU while maintaining the rate requirements of the two PUs. Three well-known and practical two-way relay strategies are considered: amplify-and-forward (AF), bit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level superposition coding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relay strategy, although the design problem is non-convex, we find the optimal solution by using certain transformation techniques and optimization tools such as semidefinite programming (SDP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP). Closed-form solutions are also obtained under certain conditions. Simulation results show that when the rate requirements of the two PUs are symmetric, by using the DF-XOR strategy and applying the proposed optimal precoding, the SU requires the least power for relaying and thus reserves the most power to transmit its own signal. In the asymmetric scenario, on the other hand, the DF-SUP strategy with the corresponding optimal precoding is the best.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2226452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6417036/06340357.pdf","startPage":"992","endPage":"1005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2226452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6417036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Linear Transceiver Designs for Cognitive Two-Way Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340357/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Linear Transceiver Designs for Cognitive Two-Way Relay Networks","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","accessionNumber":"13251071","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340357/","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Linear Transceiver Designs for Cognitive Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-tao-2226452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126418S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6417036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6417036","articleId":"6340357","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6340358,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6417036/6340358/6340358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dennis Wei (S'09\u2013M'11) received the S.B. degrees in electrical engineering and in physics in 2006, the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2011, all from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

The algorithm is based on branch-and-bound, a combinatorial optimization procedure that can either guarantee an optimal solution or produce a sparse solution with a bound on its deviation from optimality. To reduce the complexity of branch-and-bound, several methods are developed for bounding the optimal filter cost. Bounds based on infeasibility yield incrementally accumulating improvements with minimal computation, while two convex relaxations, referred to as linear and diagonal relaxations, are derived to provide stronger bounds. The approximation properties of the two relaxations are characterized analytically as well as numerically. Design examples involving wireless channel equalization and minimum-variance distortionless-response beamforming show that the complexity of obtaining certifiably optimal solutions can often be significantly reduced by incorporating diagonal relaxations, especially in more difficult instances. In the case of early termination due to computational constraints, diagonal relaxations strengthen the bound on the proximity of the final solution to the optimum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13256061","htmlLink":"/document/6340358/","displayDocTitle":"A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Quadratically-Constrained Sparse Filter Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Quadratically-Constrained Sparse Filter Design","sourcePdf":"tsp-wei-2226450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095587S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6417036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6417036","articleId":"6340358","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6340364,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Riaza","affiliation":["Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada a las Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n, ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6519344/6340364/6340364-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ricardo Riaza received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, in 1996, the M.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic (telecommunication) engineering from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from UPM in 2000.","Currently, he serves as an Associate Professor at the Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada a las Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n of the ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n (UPM).

This framework is motivated by the recent appearance of a variety of so-called mem-devices in circuit theory, and makes it possible to model the coexistence of memory effects of different nature in a single device. With a compact formalism, this setting accounts for classical devices and also for circuit elements which do not admit a two-variable description. Fully nonlinear characteristics are allowed for all devices, driving the analysis beyond the framework of Chua and Di Ventra We classify these fully nonlinear circuit elements in terms of the variables involved in their constitutive relations and the notions of the differential- and the state-order of a device. We extend the notion of a topologically degenerate configuration to this broader context, and characterize the differential-algebraic index of nodal models of such circuits. Additionally, we explore certain dynamical features of mem-circuits involving manifolds of non-isolated equilibria. Related bifurcation phenomena are explored for a family of nonlinear oscillators based on mem-devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6519344/06340364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2221174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6519344","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First Order Mem-Circuits: Modeling, Nonlinear Oscillations and Bifurcations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"First Order Mem-Circuits: Modeling, Nonlinear Oscillations and Bifurcations","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13529191","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6340364/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First Order Mem-Circuits: Modeling, Nonlinear Oscillations and Bifurcations","sourcePdf":"tcsi-riaza-2221174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119441S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6519344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6519344","articleId":"6340364","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340365,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

Implementing a centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests are outperformed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"28","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13934190","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6340375/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Robust Power System State Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Robust Power System State Estimation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-giannakis-2219629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118548S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"325","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6340375","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6340379,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengzheng Xiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6418274/6340379/6340379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengzheng Xiang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.

We investigate two coordinated beamforming designs: the quality-of-service (QoS) beamforming and the max-min SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio) beamforming. The goal of the QoS beamforming is to minimize the total power consumption while guaranteeing that received SINR at each user is above a predetermined threshold. We present a necessary condition for the optimization problem to be feasible. Then, based on the decomposition theory, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm to implement the coordinated beamforming with limited information sharing among different base stations. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge and in most cases it converges to the optimal solution. The max-min SINR (MMS) beamforming is to maximize the minimum received SINR among all users under per-base station power constraints. We show that the MMS problem and a weighted peak-power minimization (WPPM) problem are inverse problems. Based on this inversion relationship, we then propose an efficient algorithm to solve the MMS problem in an approximate manner. Simulation results demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed multicast beamforming algorithms over conventional multicasting schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.101112.112295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.101112.112295","startPage":"12","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6418274/06340379.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Multicell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Multicell Networks","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13250940","publicationDate":"January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6340379/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Multicast Beamforming in Multicell Networks","sourcePdf":"012-tw1301-xiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08591S","chronDate":"January  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6418274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6418274","articleId":"6340379","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6340382,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjae Shin","affiliation":["Signal and Systems Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6340382/6340382-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wonjae Shin (M'08) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Interference scenario in a HetNet varies based on the type of small cell access modes, which can be classified as either closed subscriber group (CSG) or open subscriber group (OSG) modes. For these two types of modes, we propose hierarchical interference alignment (HIA) schemes, which successively determine beamforming matrices for small cell and macro base stations (BSs) by considering a HetNet environment in which the macro BS and small cell BSs have different numbers of transmit antennas. Unlike prior work on interference alignment (IA) for homogeneous networks, the proposed HIA schemes compute the beamforming matrices in closed-form and reduce the feedforward overhead through a hierarchical approach. By providing a tight outer bound of the degrees-of-freedom (DoF), we also investigate the optimality of the proposed HIA schemes with respect to the number of antennas without any time expansion. Furthermore, we propose a new optimization process to maximize the sum-rate performance of each cell while satisfying the IA conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed HIA schemes provide an additional DoF compared to the conventional interference coordination schemes using a time domain-based resource partitioning. Under multi-cell interference environments, the proposed schemes offer an approximately 100% improvement in throughput gain compared to the conventional coordinated beamforming schemes when the interference from coordinated BSs is significantly stronger than the remaining interference from uncoordinated BSs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.101912.120421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06340382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.101912.120421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","startPage":"4549","endPage":"4559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Interference Alignment for Downlink Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Interference Alignment for Downlink Heterogeneous Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188230","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6340382/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Interference Alignment for Downlink Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"4549-tw1212-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074368S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6340382","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340383,"authors":[{"name":"Long Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University\uc2a0of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6361508/6340383/6340383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Long Shi (S'10) received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Changchun Institute of Technology, Jilin, China, in 2007 and M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Jilin University, Jilin, China, in 2009.

Performance evaluation for these systems is well-known for receive arrays where the antennas are close enough to experience equal average SNRs from a source. In contrast, almost no analytical results are available for macrodiversity systems where both the sources and receive antennas are widely separated. Here, receive antennas experience unequal average SNRs from a source and a single receive antenna receives a different average SNR from each source. Although this is an extremely difficult problem, progress is possible for the two-user scenario. In this paper, we derive closed form results for the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and zero forcing (ZF) receivers in independent Rayleigh channels with arbitrary numbers of receive antennas. The results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations and approximations and high SNR analysis are also derived. The results enable further system analysis such as the evaluation of outage probability, bit error rate (BER) and capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Dual-User Macrodiversity MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers in Flat Rayleigh Fading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.101112.112110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6381595/06340384.pdf","startPage":"4394","endPage":"4404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.101112.112110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Dual-User Macrodiversity MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers in Flat Rayleigh Fading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6340384/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188231","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Dual-User Macrodiversity MIMO Systems with Linear Receivers in Flat Rayleigh Fading","sourcePdf":"4394-tw1212-basnay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101487S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6340384","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6340386,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6381595/6340386/6340386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Krikidis (S'03-M'07) was born in Athens, Greece, in 1977.

We consider an optimal decoding strategy at the relay to decode the network coded sequence during the first transmission phase, which is approximately implemented using a list decoding (LD) algorithm. The algorithm jointly decodes the codewords transmitted by the two users and sorts the L most likely pair of sequences in the order of decreasing a-posteriori probabilities, based on which, estimates of the most likely network coded sequences and the decoding results are obtained. Using several examples, it is observed that a lower complexity alternative, that jointly decodes the two transmitted codewords, has a performance similar to the LD based decoding and offers a near-optimal performance in terms of the error rates corresponding to the XOR of the two decoded sequences. To analyze the error rate at the relay, an analytical approximation of the word-error rate using the joint decoding (JD) scheme is evaluated over an AWGN channel using an approach that remains valid for the general case of two users adopting different codebooks and using different power levels. We further extend our study to frequency selective channels where two decoding approaches at the relay are investigated, namely; a trellis based joint channel detector/physical-layer network coded sequence decoder (JCD/PNCD) which is shown to offer a near-optimal performance, and a reduced complexity channel detection based on a linear receiver with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion which is particularly useful where the number of channel taps is large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6340387/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"December 2012","accessionNumber":"13188234","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoding Strategies at the Relay with Physical-Layer Network Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding Strategies at the Relay with Physical-Layer Network Coding","sourcePdf":"4503-tw1212-bhat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073107S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6381595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6381595","articleId":"6340387","onlineDate":"25 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6340394,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Ben Mabrouk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering UQO Gatineau, Canada"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Ben Mabrouk","id":"37947693000"},{"name":"Larbi Talbi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering UQO Gatineau, Canada"],"firstName":"Larbi","lastName":"Talbi","id":"37276351900"},{"name":"Mourad Nedil","affiliation":["Underground communications research laboratory, UQAT, Val d'or, Canada"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Nedil","id":"37276349500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2032-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2031-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2030-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6340394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"In this paper, the incorporation of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is discussed. 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO-UWB measurement campaign in the 3-10 GHz bandwidth is conducted and the transmission performance in Line Of Sight (LOS) environment is evaluated.

The proposed algorithm exploits not only frequency diversity between 50 subcarrier separation by using DCM, but also frequency diversity between 25 subcarrier separation by using additional precoding, resulting in better performance than the conventional DCM. We also propose a method for detecting the proposed algorithm by sharing the modified dual carrier modulation (MDCM) detection block which is basically included MB-OFDM UWB systems. The proposed detection method prevents the increase in hardware complexity caused by additional precoding.

The wideband input impedance matching was achieved by taking advantage of the resistive shunt-shunt feedback and source-degeneration topology, but in the proposed circuit the resistive feedback signal is taken from different node in contrast to the traditional cascade LNA. By utilizing a center-tapped inductor (CTI) at the inter-stage network of the LNA a high gain is obtained over the entire bandwidth (BW) with small die area. Analytical expressions have been derived for the input impedance matching of the circuit. Using the proposed technique, power gain of 17\u00b1.5dB and noise figure between 2.8-4dB was achieved in a bandwidth of 8-18GHz.

The use of UWB signals can provide distance measurements with very high accuracy but a big challenge is caused by high attenuation resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. It is well-known that analog-to-digital conversion is practically not feasible for UWB. Compressed Sensing is an emerging concept which potentially could solve this problem. The weakness of this concept is to handle noisy signals. We propose an implementation strategy to overcome this problem. The hardware implementation and complexity are also taken into account. Simulation results show significant improvements compared to conventional algorithms for both ideal and measured signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing for UWB medical radar applications","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2012.6340444","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/6328564/6339584/06340444.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2012.6340444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing for UWB medical radar applications","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340444/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing for UWB medical radar applications","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081562S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6328564","isNumber":"6339584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6328564","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6339584","articleId":"6340444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6340445,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In indoor environments, the required orthogonality between multi-users channels, which is necessary for proper IA, could be hardly reached. The spatial diversity among the users/nodes is mostly insufficient to obtain a robust performance for IA algorithms. In this work, a practical artificial channel diversity technique is applied through antenna selection to choose the best scenario providing the maximum orthogonality and consequentially the best overall system performance. Our analysis considers deterministic UWB MIMO channel model based on EM Ray-tracing in a real-world multi-user indoor environment.

In this paper, the emission of the coexisting singles and their occupied frequency band detection technique for the MB-OFDM (Multi-Band OFDM) system is proposed in order to improve the DER (miss Detection Error Rate) and the FAR (False Alarm Rate). The received coexisting signal is assumed to be the sum of the sinusoidal waves. The sinusoidal signal is detected and it is subtracted from the received signal iteratively to minimize the evaluation function. The frequency, phase and amplitude of the sinusoidal signals are estimated using the evaluation function and the Newton method. Obtained amplitude coefficients are combined per the bandwidth and the results are compared with the threshold to detect coexisting signal having wider bandwidth than FFT bin. The DER and FAR are evaluated to show the effectiveness of the proposed detection technique. The performances of the proposed detection scheme are improved comparing to the ordinary scheme using FFT.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2012.6340484","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/6328564/6339584/06340484.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2012.6340484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of coexisting signal detection for MB-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340484/","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of coexisting signal detection for MB-OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117338","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340484/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of coexisting signal detection for MB-OFDM system","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"0215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062625S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6328564","isNumber":"6339584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6328564","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6339584","articleId":"6340484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6340497,"authors":[{"name":"Ghasem Naddafzadeh Shirazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Ghasem Naddafzadeh","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37407711100"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2032-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2031-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2030-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"CD","value":"2162-6588"}],"articleNumber":"6340497","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Source coding","Quantization","Compressed sensing","Signal to noise ratio","Protocols","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","cryptographic protocols","probability","source coding","telecommunication security","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing approach","UWB channel reciprocity","CS-based secret key agreement protocol","CS-SKAP","key agreement probability","secret key length","syndrome-based distributed source coding technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Distributed source coding","Secret key generation","Ultra wideband channel identification"]}],"abstract":"We present a compressive sensing (CS) approach for secret key agreement based on UWB channel reciprocity.

This term is deduced from a simple PD model comprising a capacitive network. However, from a physical point of view, a PD defect cannot be represented by a capacitance, as argued by Pedersen and his coworkers. As an alternative, Pedersen proposed a field theoretical approach that is based on a dipole model. This more sophisticated concept has been ignored in the past, whereas the capacitive PD model is accepted also nowadays. Apparently, the reason for that is that the charge transfer can easily be calculated for the capacitive equivalent circuit, which is not the case if the field theoretical approach based on the dipole concept is adopted. As will be reported in this article, the analysis can substantially be simplified if instead of gaseous discharges in spherical, elliptical, or cylindrical cavities, as commonly regarded in the relevant literature, the establishment of a dipole moment in a uniform field between solid dielectric layers is considered.","doi":"10.1109/MEI.2012.6340519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/57/6340511/06340519.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEI.2012.6340519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A critical review of partial-discharge models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A critical review of partial-discharge models","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13100883","htmlLink":"/document/6340519/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A critical review of partial-discharge models","sourcePdf":"EIM6-011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070306S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"57","isNumber":"6340511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"57","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6340511","articleId":"6340519","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6340524,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongdong Wang","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/57/6340511/6340524/6340524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongdong Wang (M'00) was born in Hebei, China, in 1969.

A dataset is imbalanced if there is a great difference between observations from each class. Classification methods that do not consider this phenomenon are prone to produce decision boundaries totally biased towards the majority class. Today, assembly methods like DataBoost-IM combine sampling strategies with Boosting, and oversampling methods. However, when the input data has much noise these algorithms tend to reduce their performances. This work present a new method to deal with imbalanced data called SwarmBoost that combines Bossting, oversampling, and sub sampling based in optimization criteria to select samples. The results show that SwarmBoost has a better performance than DataBoost-IM and Smote for several databases.","doi":"10.1109/STSIVA.2012.6340585","startPage":"218","endPage":"222","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XVII Symposium of Image, Signal Processing, and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330713/6340541/06340585.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 XVII Symposium of Image, Signal Processing, and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STSIVA.2012.6340585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A strategy for classifying imbalanced data sets based on particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Media","Single photon emission computed tomography","Heart","Breast","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imbalanced data set classification","particle swarm optimization","machine learning","learning algorithms","classification methods","decision boundaries","assembly methods","sampling strategies","oversampling methods","SwarmBoost method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DataBoost-IM","Smote","SwarmBoost and PSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A strategy for classifying imbalanced data sets based on particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6340585/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117806","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strategy for classifying imbalanced data sets based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Medellin, Colombia","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081061S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330713","isNumber":"6340541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330713","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6340541","articleId":"6340585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6340705,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangpeng Dai","affiliation":["Information & Communication Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangpeng","lastName":"Dai","id":"37086679364"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["Information & Communication Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086681760"},{"name":"Lipeng Zhu","affiliation":["Information & Communication Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lipeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086681152"},{"name":"Haiyun Han","affiliation":["Information & Communication Department, China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haiyun","lastName":"Han","id":"37086681002"},{"name":"Jianbo Liu","affiliation":["Information System Integration Company, NARI Group Corporation, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086678566"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0915-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0914-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6340705","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Heuristic algorithms","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","parallel processing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperation strategy","cloud computing","powerful computing capabilities","parallel processing","novel dynamic resource allocation algorithm","heuristic information-based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource Allocation","Cloud Computing","Dynamic","Cooperation Strategy","Parallel Processing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is featured by powerful computing capabilities.

Therefore, it is proposed that neural networks are combined with the expert system for fault diagnosis. This paper presents the development of a framework for integrated system of fault diagnosis in oil equipments based on neural networks. The framework employs a combination of technologies, including dynamic database, comprehensive knowledge base and neural networks.

The implemented control structure consists of a conventional controller in parallel with a FNN. The former is provided both to guarantee global asymptotic stability in compact space and acts as a sliding surface to guide the states of the system towards zero. The output of the conventional controller is used to update the parameters of the FNN. The output of the FNN gradually replaces the conventional controller. The adaptive learning rate makes it possible to control the system without priori knowledge about the upper bound of the states of the system and their derivatives. An appropriate Lyapunov function approach is used to analyze the stability of the adaptation law of parameters of FNN. Sufficient conditions to guarantee the boundedness of the parameters are derived. The proposed approach is tested on the velocity control of an electro hydraulic servo system in presence of flow nonlinearities and internal friction.","doi":"10.1109/ICSSEM.2012.6340783","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331799/6340697/06340783.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 3rd International Conference on System Science, Engineering Design and Manufacturing Informatization","publicationTitle":"2012 3rd International Conference on System Science, Engineering Design and Manufacturing Informatization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSSEM.2012.6340783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6340697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training fuzzy neural networks using sliding mode theory with adaptive learning rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6340783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Training fuzzy neural networks using sliding mode theory with adaptive learning rate","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13116187","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6340783/","conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training fuzzy neural networks using sliding mode theory with adaptive learning rate","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"85p127132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053372S","chronDate":"20-21 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331799","isNumber":"6340697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6340697","articleId":"6340783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6340819,"authors":[{"name":"Youjun Yue","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Youjun","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085833025"},{"name":"Hui Zhao","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37673107200"},{"name":"Yunlei Zhao","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yunlei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086789779"},{"name":"Hongjun Wang","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086791132"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0915-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0914-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6340819","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Genetic algorithms","Fault location","Heuristic algorithms","Generators","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","fault location","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network fault location","distributed generator","distribution network fault section positioning","standard genetic algorithm","distributed generator power supply","DG","genetic algorithm coding","fitness function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed generator","genetic algorithm","fault location"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6340819","abstract":"In the distribution network fault section positioning, the standard genetic algorithm can be used effectively.

The proposed slow adaptive OFDMA-PON is realized by employing a clipping modulation of an optical seed carrier, which is fed to uplink transmitters at an optical network unit (ONU) in a carrier distribution scheme. Therefore, a fast changing characteristic of the single-fiber loopback channel, which is mainly attributed to Rayleigh backscattering interference, can be dramatically stabilized. Consequently, the uplink OFDMA-PON transmitters can reduce a large number of signal processing in updating channel state information and relevant subcarrier allocation for multiple access unless the required traffic condition changes for the given ONU.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6362248/06341051.pdf","startPage":"2292","endPage":"2295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2012.2226571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2012.2226571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6362248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA-PON Through Channel Stabilization Employing Seed Carrier Clipping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical network units","Optical fibers","Resource management","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optical fibre networks","optical links","passive optical networks","Rayleigh scattering","signal processing","stability","telecommunication channels","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slow adaptive OFDMA-PON","channel stabilization","seed carrier clipping","slow adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based passive optical network","single-fiber loopback link","clipping modulation","optical seed carrier","uplink transmitters","optical network unit","ONU","carrier distribution scheme","single-fiber loopback channel","Rayleigh backscattering interference","uplink OFDMA-PON transmitters","signal processing","channel state information","subcarrier allocation","multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel stabilization","passive optical network (PON)","slow adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","subcarrier allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA-PON Through Channel Stabilization Employing Seed Carrier Clipping","volume":"24","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/6341051/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2012","accessionNumber":"13150315","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA-PON Through Channel Stabilization Employing Seed Carrier Clipping","sourcePdf":"lpt-hong-2226571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046496S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6362248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6362248","articleId":"6341051","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6341056,"authors":[{"name":"Okan Zafer Batur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Okan Zafer","lastName":"Batur","id":"38093130200"},{"name":"E.

Due to nonlinearity, high sensitivity of the inverse mapping from external measurements, and measurement errors, SOC estimation has remained a challenging task. This is further compounded by the fact that battery characteristic model parameters change with time and operating conditions. This paper introduces an adaptive nonlinear observer design that compensates nonlinearity and achieves better estimation accuracy. A two-time-scale signal processing method is employed to attenuate the effects of measurement noises on SOC estimates. The results are further expanded to derive an integrated algorithm to identify model parameters and initial SOC jointly. Simulations were performed to illustrate the capability and utility of the algorithms. Experimental verifications are conducted on Li-ion battery packs of different capacities under different load profiles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated System Identification and

Their high flux densities in the air gap result in nonlinear analytical models, which need to be time optimized. The incorporated reluctance networks are sensitive to the correctness of air gap permeances. Conventionally, in these networks, air gap permeances are calculated by approximating flux paths; however, it is time inefficient. For an improved simulation time, spatial discretization techniques are presented to calculate air gap permeances in double salient PM machines. The spatial techniques discussed here cover the tooth contour method and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping as semidiscrete methods, which are used to discretize only the air gap region. Their results are verified by the spatial discrete method and finite element method, which discretizes the whole machine geometry. For consistency in this paper, all methods are explained on a three-phase 12/10 flux-switching PM motor. Obtained air gap permeances show a very good agreement with only 0.8% difference. Further on, machine characteristics such as phase flux linkage and cogging torque are also compared to show the impact of the modeling techniques. The total machine simulation time is improved by 20% using the SC method. Although methods are explained particularly for double salient PM machines, formulas are generalizable for other machine types as well.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2012.2226692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399585","startPage":"2165","endPage":"2172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6399585/06341071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Discretization Methods for Air Gap Permeance Calculations in Double Salient Traction Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341071/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatial Discretization Methods for Air Gap Permeance Calculations in Double Salient Traction Motors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13191375","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Discretization Methods for Air Gap Permeance Calculations in Double Salient Traction Motors","sourcePdf":"tia-ilhan-2226692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089127S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6399585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6399585","articleId":"6341071","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6341078,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Pajic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & System Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6683081/6341078/6341078-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miroslav Pajic received the Dipl.

We study the safety of a medical device system for the physiologic closed-loop control of drug infusion. The main contribution of the paper is the verification approach for the safety properties of closed-loop medical device systems. We demonstrate, using a case study, that the approach can be applied to a system of clinical importance. Our method combines simulation-based analysis of a detailed model of the system that contains continuous patient dynamics with model checking of a more abstract timed automata model. We show that the relationship between the two models preserves the crucial aspect of the timing behavior that ensures the conservativeness of the safety analysis. We also describe system design that can provide open-loop safety under network failure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Drugs","Principal component analysis","Heart rate","Biomedical monitoring","Analytical models","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automata theory","closed loop systems","hospitals","medical control systems","open loop systems","safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven safety analysis","hospitals","cyber-physical system","physiologic closed-loop control","drug infusion","closed-loop medical device systems","simulation-based analysis","continuous patient dynamics","model checking","abstract timed automata model","open-loop safety","network failure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closed-loop medical systems","high-confidence medical systems","model-based development","safety analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2226594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6683081/06341078.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2226594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Safety Analysis of Closed-Loop Medical Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Safety Analysis of Closed-Loop Medical Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341078/","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341078/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13973011","pubMedId":"24177176","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Safety Analysis of Closed-Loop Medical Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-pajic-2226594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10891S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6683081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6683081","articleId":"6341078","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6341083,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Tandon","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ravi Tandon (S'03\u2013M'09) received the B.

It is shown that having output feedback and delayed CSIT can strictly enlarge the DoF region of the MIMO IC when compared to the case in which only delayed CSIT is present. The proposed coding schemes that achieve the corresponding DoF region with feedback and delayed CSIT utilize both resources, i.e., feedback and delayed CSIT in a nontrivial manner. It is also shown that the DoF region with local feedback and delayed CSIT is equal to the DoF region with global feedback and delayed CSIT, i.e., local feedback and delayed CSIT is equivalent to global feedback and delayed CSIT from the perspective of the DoF region. The converse is proved for a stronger setting in which the channels to the two receivers need not be statistically equivalent.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2012.2226700","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6461106/06341083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2012.2226700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461106","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO Interference Channel With Output Feedback and Delayed CSIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO Interference Channel With Output Feedback and Delayed CSIT","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13307113","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6341083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO Interference Channel With Output Feedback and Delayed CSIT","sourcePdf":"tit-tandon-2226700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093221S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6461106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6461106","articleId":"6341083","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341092,"authors":[{"name":"Faliu Yi","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Faliu Yi received the B.E. degree from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, in 2008 and the M.E. degree in computer engineering from Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea, in 2012, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the same university.","His research interests include 3D image processing, computer vision, image segmentation, object tracking, pattern recognition and parallel computing."]},"firstName":"Faliu","lastName":"Yi","id":"38070698000"},{"name":"Inkyu Moon","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Inkyu Moon (M'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from SungKyunKwan University, Korea, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 2007.","From January 2008 to January 2009, he was a Researcher in a postdoctoral position at the University of Connecticut, Storrs.

A random pulse-position-modulation (PPM) analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) architecture is proposed. A prototype 9-bit random PPM ADC incorporating a pseudo-random sampling scheme is implemented as proof of concept. This approach leverages the energy efficiency of time-based processing. The use of sampling techniques that exploit signal compressibility leads to further improvements in efficiency. The random PPM (pulse-position-modulation) ADC employs compressive sampling techniques to efficiently sample at sub-Nyquist rates. The sub-sampled signal is recovered using a reconstruction algorithm, which is tailored for practical hardware implementation. We develop a theoretical analysis of the hardware architecture and the reconstruction algorithm. Measurements of a prototype random PPM ADC and simulation, demonstrate this theory. The prototype successfully demonstrates a 90% reduction in sampling rate compared to the Nyquist rate for input signals that are 3% sparse in frequency domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2221832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06341093.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"515","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2221832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Power Compressive Sampling Time-Based Analog-to-Digital Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power Compressive Sampling Time-Based Analog-to-Digital Converter","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6341093/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167814","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power Compressive Sampling Time-Based Analog-to-Digital Converter","sourcePdf":"jetcas-yenduri-2221832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152722S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6341093","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6341094,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6374660/6341094/6341094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Zhang (S'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, from Department of Mathematics and School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in School of Computer Science and Technology.","In 2008, he joined the Joint Research and Development Lab (JDL), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, as a Research Assistant.

Its theory shows that when the signal is sparse enough in some domain, it can be decoded from many fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory. So one of the most challenging researches in CS is to seek a domain where a signal can exhibit a high degree of sparsity and hence be recovered faithfully. Most of the conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g., DCT, wavelet, and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the nonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery via collaborative sparsity, which enforces local 2-D sparsity and nonlocal 3-D sparsity simultaneously in an adaptive hybrid space-transform domain, thus substantially utilizing intrinsic sparsity of natural images and greatly confining the CS solution space. In addition, an efficient augmented Lagrangian-based technique is developed to solve the above optimization problem. Experimental results on a wide range of natural images are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the new CS recovery strategy.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2220391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6374660/06341094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2220391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6374660","startPage":"380","endPage":"391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Compressive Sensing Recovery via Collaborative Sparsity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image Compressive Sensing Recovery via Collaborative Sparsity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13167815","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341094/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Compressive Sensing Recovery via Collaborative Sparsity","sourcePdf":"jetcas-zhang-2220391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098723S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6374660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6374660","articleId":"6341094","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6341095,"authors":[{"name":"Michael H.

The goal is to model the attenuation caused by the tree canopies in vegetated residential areas in a simplified manner. The model is based on the Torrico-Bertoni-Lang model. It describes a vegetated residential area where rows of houses and trees are lying between an elevated transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna that is located at street level. In this scenario, the receiving antenna does not have a direct line of sight (LoS) from the transmitting antenna. Since the transmitting antenna has comparable height to the houses, propagation takes place over the top of the houses. From this viewpoint, the propagation loss is computed by using multiscreen diffraction, where the houses are modeled as absorbing screens, and the trees are modeled as phase screens. Using this approach, the total propagation loss is broken into three components, namely, free-space loss, multiscreen diffraction loss, and rooftop-to-street diffraction loss. In this paper, two main contributions are provided. The first is that a simplified analytical model is proposed to compute the multiscreen diffraction loss in a vegetated residential environment. The second contribution is to include in a simplified manner the effects of vegetation on the rooftop-to-street diffraction loss via the scattering theory of Foldy-Lax. To verify the proposed model, cross-season measurement campaigns at 800 and 3500 MHz were conducted in vegetated residential areas in the north of Germany. The model serves as an important extension of the Walfisch-Bertoni urban model and the COST-231 Walfisch-Ikegami model for applications in vegetated residential areas. The model is valid at the UHF frequency band between 0.5 and 3.5 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2226764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06341121.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2226764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiowave Propagation Prediction in Vegetated Residential Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341121/","displayDocTitle":"Radiowave Propagation Prediction in Vegetated Residential Environments","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307178","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341121/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiowave Propagation Prediction in Vegetated Residential Environments","sourcePdf":"tvt-chee-2226764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096827S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6341121","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341123,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Lameiro","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6341123/6341123-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristian Lameiro (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering in 2010 from the University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include signal processing for wireless communications, multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems, MIMO test beds, interference alignment, and relay channels.

Following the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, the problem consists of finding the transmit and receive beamformers of the nodes and relay (as well as the power allocated to each one) that achieve the boundary of the optimal rate region. To solve it, we first express the optimal node beamformers in terms of relay beamformers and then show that the optimal rate region can efficiently be characterized using convex optimization techniques. We also extend our study to the multiple-relay scenario when the source nodes are single antenna and propose a distributed algorithm to compute the relay beamforming matrices. The proposed algorithm consists of solving two different subproblems. First, each individual TWRC is optimized independently. Next, a distributed beamforming is applied to make the signals from the relays add up coherently at the source nodes. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed techniques and to compare the performance of analog beamforming architectures against conventional MIMO schemes that operate at the baseband.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2226612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06341123.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2226612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"642","endPage":"654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Strategies in the Two-Way Relay Channel With Analog Tx\u2013Rx Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2012","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Strategies in the Two-Way Relay Channel With Analog Tx\u2013Rx Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341123/","volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6341123/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13307180","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward Strategies in the Two-Way Relay Channel With Analog Tx\u2013Rx Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-lameiro-2226612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091258S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6341123","onlineDate":"26 October 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341124,"authors":[{"name":"Khaleel Mershad","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6341124/6341124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khaleel Mershad received the B.E. degree (with high distinction) in computer engineering and informatics from Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon, in July 2004 and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, Lebanon, in February 2007 and January 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, AUB, where he is doing research in cloud computing and vehicular ad hoc networks.

Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) enable vehicles to communicate with each other and with roadside units (RSUs). Service-oriented vehicular networks are special types of VANETs that support diverse infrastructure-based commercial services, including Internet access, real-time traffic management, video streaming, and content distribution. Many forms of attacks against service-oriented VANETs that attempt to threaten their security have emerged. The success of data acquisition and delivery systems depends on their ability to defend against the different types of security and privacy attacks that exist in service-oriented VANETs. This paper introduces a system that takes advantage of the RSUs that are connected to the Internet and that provide various types of information to VANET users. We provide a suite of novel security and privacy mechanisms in our proposed system and evaluate its performance using the ns2 software.

We expanded a passive-mixer first receiver to N>;8 phases and characterized gain, noise and input impedance tuning range. Additionally, we included hardware to directly measure the effect of overlapping LO pulses on the gain and input impedance of these receivers. Finally, we propose a method to use integrated inductors to suppress the currents which flow when two mixer switches are on at the same time, alleviating this loss mechanism.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of LO harmonics and overlap shunting on N-phase passive mixer based receivers","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2012.6341270","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331297/6341242/06341270.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2012.6341270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of LO harmonics and overlap shunting on N-phase passive mixer based receivers","conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341270/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135366","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of LO harmonics and overlap shunting on N-phase passive mixer based receivers","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"C031A5LB13380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045555S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331297","isNumber":"6341242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331297","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6341242","articleId":"6341270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341271,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Bagga","affiliation":["ERL/DIMES, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Bagga","id":"37270142200"},{"name":"Andre L.

Circuit performance and parametric variability are simulated based on a model developed specifically for this technology. Fully-static logic gates and flip-flops as well as a low-area dynamic flip-flop enabled by the use of complementary OTFTs are measured, showing good agreement with simulations. A comparator exploiting offset cancellation techniques achieves a measured offset of less than 200mV. In addition, small-sized envelope detectors are measured at the HF RFID frequency (13.56MHz), to demonstrate the high frequency performance of the OTFTs. All these circuits are building blocks for the realization of a printed RFID tag.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341310/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13135404","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of analog and digital building blocks in a fully printed complementary organic technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of analog and digital building blocks in a fully printed complementary organic technology","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"C038A5LC33305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055922S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331297","isNumber":"6341242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331297","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6341242","articleId":"6341310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341313,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37983319000"},{"name":"Howard C.

Two differential four-phase DDRMs are organized in a Doherty-like configuration using two different transformers. The modulated tuning capacitors concept is proposed to achieve a high efficiency at maximum output power and at back-off. To demonstrate this principle, a 2 GHz IQ Digital Doherty Transmitter with on-chip transformers has been integrated in 90 nm CMOS Technology. The digital IQ transmitter achieves a maximum output power of 24.8 dBm with 26% drain efficiency and 26% drain efficiency at 6 dB back-off. With a 10 MHz RFBW multi-tone OFDM signal, the transmitter consumes 176 mA from a 2.4 V supply. It achieves 18.8 dBm RMS output power with 18% average drain efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331297/6341242/06341324.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2012.6341324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2012.6341324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS IQ Digital Doherty Transmitter using modulated tuning capacitors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Power amplifiers","Tuning","Transmitters","Power generation","CMOS integrated circuits","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS IQ digital Doherty transmitter","modulated tuning capacitors","drain efficiency","direct digital RF modulators","differential four-phase DDRM","Doherty-like configuration","onchip transformers","CMOS technology","digital IQ transmitter","RFBW multitone OFDM signal","RMS output power","frequency 2 GHz","size 90 nm","current 176 mA","voltage 2.4 V","efficiency 18 percent"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS IQ Digital Doherty Transmitter using modulated tuning capacitors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135418","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS IQ Digital Doherty Transmitter using modulated tuning capacitors","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"C087C3LB23280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061486S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331297","isNumber":"6341242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331297","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6341242","articleId":"6341324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341325,"authors":[{"name":"Shunta Iguchi","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunta","lastName":"Iguchi","id":"38466633100"},{"name":"Akira Saito","affiliation":["Semiconductor Technology Academic Research Center, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Saito","id":"38466181900"},{"name":"Kazunori Watanabe","affiliation":["Semiconductor Technology Academic Research Center, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37599666400"},{"name":"Takayasu Sakurai","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayasu","lastName":"Sakurai","id":"37275966400"},{"name":"Makoto Takamiya","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Takamiya","id":"37282760800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2213-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2212-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2211-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"6341325","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341325","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","CMOS integrated circuits","Wireless sensor networks","Transistors","Mixers","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","power amplifiers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drain efficiency","class-F power amplifier","dual power supply voltage","OOK transmitter","frequency 315 MHz"]}],"abstract":"Dual power supply voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n) scheme is proposed to increase the efficiency of a power amplifier (PA) with small output power (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OUT</sub>\n) for short-range wireless sensor networks (e.g. body area networks).

This new feedback topology can achieve a higher gain bandwidth product to increase linearity and power supply rejection than the fixed switching frequency solutions. The switching frequency spread can also reduce the external EMI filtering constraints. To reduce the idle consumption and radiated emissions at zero output level, a synchronization technique is presented to provide truly differential outputs. The proposed amplifier, realized in CMOS 130nm process, drives up to 1W load with 0.02% THD+N, 90% efficiency with power supply range from 2.3 to 5V. The synchronization technique reduces shows up to 75% of idle consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341345/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135439","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A synchronized self oscillating Class-D amplifier for mobile application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synchronized self oscillating Class-D amplifier for mobile application","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"C107C5LC33091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039109S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331297","isNumber":"6341242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331297","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6341242","articleId":"6341345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341348,"authors":[{"name":"Jesse Richmond","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Richmond","id":"37708626400"},{"name":"Mervin John","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Mervin","lastName":"John","id":"37541380000"},{"name":"Louis Alarcon","affiliation":["University of the Philippines, Diliman, Philippines"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Alarcon","id":"38345985200"},{"name":"Wenting Zhou","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Wenting","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38497126900"},{"name":"Wen Li","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Li","id":"38498347300"},{"name":"Tsung-Te Liu","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Tsung-Te","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065335700"},{"name":"Massimo Alioto","affiliation":["EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","University of Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Alioto","id":"37273061100"},{"name":"Seth R.

Graph exploration algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS), are largely dominated by memory latency and are challenging to process efficiently. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable hardware methodology for efficient parallel processing of large-scale graph exploration problems. Our methodology is based on a reconfigurable hardware architecture which decouples computation and communication while keeping multiple memory requests in flight at any given time, taking advantage of the hardware capabilities of both FPGAs and the parallel memory subsystem. To validate our methodology, we provide a detailed design description of the Breadth-First Search algorithm on an FPGA-based high performance computing system. Using graph data based on the power-law graphs found in real-word problems, we are able to achieve performance results that are superior to those of high performance multi-core systems in the recent literature for large graph instances, and a throughput in excess of 2.5 billion traversed edges per second on RMAT graphs with 16 million vertices and over a billion edges.

However, the relatively slow performance of JPEG2000, especially in software implementations, is a critical drawback of the standard. Moreover, as image sizes rapidly grow in size, higher demands on performance for image coding and processing are introduced, making the slow performance of JPEG2000 even further pronounced. While much effort over the past decade has been devoted to accelerating the JPEG2000 encoder, there have been very few studies focusing on improving the performance of the JPEG2000 decoder, despite the fact that the performance of the decoder is just as critical as the encoder. This paper proposes a high-performance JPEG2000 decoder that efficiently exploits the recent improvements of modern parallel programming models and hardware architectures. Specifically, a parallel streaming decoder running on a GPGPU-CPU heterogeneous system is developed to fully exploit the flexibility of the high-performance multi-core CPUs and the massively parallel capability of GPGPUs. In addition, a new task scheduling strategy is developed that exploits the soft-heterogeneity in OpenCL and C/C++ at runtime in order to gain a significant performance boost. Running on a heterogeneous configuration of one Nvidia GTX 480 GPU and one Intel Core i7 CPU, the parallel streaming decoder gains more than 8X speedup in runtime compared to the JasPer JPEG2000 software implementation.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2012.34","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341240/6341446/06341449.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2012.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Parallel JPEG2000 Streaming Decoder Using GPGPU-CPU Heterogeneous System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Parallel JPEG2000 Streaming Decoder Using GPGPU-CPU Heterogeneous System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13119471","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341449/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Parallel JPEG2000 Streaming Decoder Using GPGPU-CPU Heterogeneous System","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4768a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045231S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341240","isNumber":"6341446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341240","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6341446","articleId":"6341449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6341450,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37897698700"},{"name":"Roger D.

It is well-accepted that specialization and heterogeneity are crucial strategies to improve both power and performance. Yet, how to design highly efficient processing elements while maintaining enough flexibility within a domain of applications is a fundamental question. In this paper, we present the design of a specialized Linear Algebra Core (LAC) for an important class of computational kernels, the level-3 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We demonstrate a detailed algorithm/architecture co-design for mapping a number of level-3 BLAS operations onto the LAC. Results show that our prototype LAC achieves a performance of around 64 GFLOPS (double precision) for these operations, while consuming less than 1.3 Watts in standard 45nm CMOS technology. This is on par with a full-custom design and up to 50\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 better in terms of power efficiency than CPUs and GPUs.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2012.18","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341240/6341446/06341465.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2012.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear Algebra Core Design for Efficient Level-3 BLAS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341465/","displayDocTitle":"A Linear Algebra Core Design for Efficient Level-3 BLAS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13119486","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341465/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear Algebra Core Design for Efficient Level-3 BLAS","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4768a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096533S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341240","isNumber":"6341446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341240","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6341446","articleId":"6341465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341468,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Mart\u00edn","id":"37403801100"},{"name":"Osmell Machado","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Osmell","lastName":"Machado","id":"38501890100"},{"name":"Francisco J.

Such signals contain a high and fluctuating rate of pulses. Pulse shape hints particle type, and the amplitude relates to energy of the particle, while pulse occurrence times are needed for event reconstruction. Traditionally, these parameters have been extracted with the help of complete racks of dedicated electronics. Our FPGA design on a general-purpose DAQ card does real-time pulse detection and high-precision curve fitting. It greatly shrinks required equipment in terms of form factor, cost, power usage, and setup time. Unlike traditional systems, we can handle bursts of back-to-back pulses, pulses as narrow as 6 ns and at rates over 1M pulses per second. We have a novel scalable architecture that combines pipelining and parallelism. Moreover, the parallel part of the architecture uses loop pipelining in each of its interleaved identical parallel processors (IIPPs). An IIPP is a specialized CPU, which executes nested loops, with number of iterations that varies from pulse to pulse. IIPPs are fed data from a FIFO by a priority encoder based dispatcher. Number of IIPPs can be calculated to meet any pulse rate and average pulse width. The architecture is flexible enough to work with a variety of curve fitting algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341240/6341446/06341473.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2012.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2012.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Particle Identification in High Energy Physics Experiments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipeline processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Data acquisition","Physics","Computer architecture","Detectors","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","field programmable gate arrays","parallel processing","particle detectors","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","particle identification","high energy physics experiments","on-the-fly signal processing","particle detectors","pulse shape hints particle type","general-purpose DAQ card","real-time pulse detection","high-precision curve fitting","loop pipelining","interleaved identical parallel processors","IIPP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["curve fitting","DAQ","high energy physics","parallelism","pipelining","pulse shape discrimination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Based Particle Identification in High Energy Physics Experiments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13119494","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Based Particle Identification in High Energy Physics Experiments","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"4768a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057521S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341240","isNumber":"6341446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341240","xplore-issue":"6341446","articleId":"6341473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341498,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Panagiotidis","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Panagiotidis","id":"37845760800"},{"name":"Daniel Kauker","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kauker","id":"38193946100"},{"name":"Filip Sadlo","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Sadlo","id":"37282541900"},{"name":"Thomas Ertl","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ertl","id":"37268023800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2599-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"6341498","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Graphics processing unit","Servers","Synchronization","Visualization","Processor scheduling","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","data visualisation","distributed processing","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed computation","large-scale visualization","heterogeneous compute environments","high performance computing","heterogeneous environments","homogeneous clusters","DIANA","API","finite-time Lyapunov exponent field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DIANA","GPGPU","DMP","distributed computation","large-scale visualization","FTLE"]}],"abstract":"High performance computing still typically disregards heterogeneous environments and focuses on homogeneous clusters.

However, a methodology is required to measure the robustness of the dynamic loop scheduling methods that ensures their performance in unpredictably changing computing environments. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for performing robustness analysis of the dynamic loop scheduling techniques using a metric, formulated in earlier work, to measure their robustness in heterogeneous computing systems with uncertainties.

The results show considerable performance improvements in many situations. Due to the basic character of the explicit Euler method, the results of this investigation can guide the optimization of more complex ODE methods with higher order and better stability on GPUs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 11th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341239/6341486/06341520.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"266","publicationTitle":"2012 11th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2012.42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2012.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diamond-Like Tiling Schemes for Efficient Explicit Euler on GPUs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diamond-like carbon","Approximation methods","Memory management","Arrays","Optimization","Graphics processing unit","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","graphics processing units","initial value problems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diamond-like tiling schemes","explicit Euler","GPU computing","optimization techniques","initial value problems","IVP","ordinary differential equations","ODE","GPU memory hierarchy","OpenCL implementations","runtime experiments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU computing","parallelism","loop tiling","memory hierarchy","ordinary differential equations","initial value problems","explicit Euler method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Diamond-Like Tiling Schemes for Efficient Explicit Euler on GPUs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341520/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"13118519","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"25-29 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diamond-Like Tiling Schemes for Efficient Explicit Euler on GPUs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"4805a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055973S","chronDate":"25-29 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341239","isNumber":"6341486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341239","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6341486","articleId":"6341520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6341548,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Salama","affiliation":["Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Salama","id":"37085354249"},{"name":"Ahmed Shawish","affiliation":["Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Shawish","id":"37688884400"},{"name":"Amir Zeid","affiliation":["American University of Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Zeid","id":"37560610300"},{"name":"Mohamed Kouta","affiliation":["Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kouta","id":"37284139700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2714-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4758-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6341548","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Computational modeling","Time factors","Cloud computing","Throughput","Mathematical model","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cost-benefit analysis","optimisation","quality of service","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated QoS utility-based model","cloud computing service provider","Internet","on-demand services","pay-as-you-go financial model","predefined quality of service requirements","performance evaluation","cost-benefit analysis","optimal service provider selection","mathematical model","cloud service provider selection optimization problem","market-oriented platforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Quality of Service","Utility","service provider selection"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing is gaining a considerable attention in the past few years. It changes the way people acquire software and hardware as it provides them as services through internet on-demand following a pay-as-you-go financial model. With the exponential increase of such service, selecting the optimal provider based on predefined Quality of Service (QoS) requirements becomes crucial. The current techniques are just designed for performance evaluation and cost-benefit analysis; yet optimal service provider selection based on a group of QoS requirements is still uncovered as it should be. In this paper we propose a mathematical model addressing the Cloud service provider selection optimization problem based on QoS guarantees. The proposed model efficiently matches with the characteristics of market-oriented platforms covering a wide range of service provider selection problems. The efficiency of the proposed model is validated through simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2012.18","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6341241/6341540/06341548.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2012.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated QoS Utility-Based Model for Cloud Computing Service Provider Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341548/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated QoS Utility-Based Model for Cloud Computing Service Provider Selection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13119505","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341548/","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated QoS Utility-Based Model for Cloud Computing Service Provider Selection","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"4758a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118701S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6341241","isNumber":"6341540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6341241","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6341540","articleId":"6341548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341595,"authors":[{"name":"Shou-Yu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shou-Yu","lastName":"Lee","id":"38508149400"},{"name":"Dongyang Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Dongyang","lastName":"Tang","id":"38505425600"},{"name":"Tingchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tingchao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38510798500"},{"name":"William Cheng-Chung Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"William Cheng-Chung","lastName":"Chu","id":"37278389000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2714-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4758-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6341595","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Resource management","Service oriented architecture","Quality of service","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","middleware","service-oriented architecture","software agents","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS assurance middleware model","enterprise cloud computing","multitenancy","cross layer service composition","software as a service","platform as a service","infrastructure as a service","user requirement","service level agreement","quality of service","service monitoring","resource allocation","service status analysis","agent technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SOA","Agent","Enterprise Cloud Computing","Monitoring"]}],"abstract":"Enterprise Cloud Computing has the complicated issues of the multi-tenancy, cross layer service composition, i.e., Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service, multiple constraints from user requirements and Service Level Agreements.

This paper proposes a novel framework of style transfer mapping (STM) for writer adaptation. The STM is a writer-specific class-independent feature transformation which has a closed-form solution. After style transfer mapping, the data of different writers are projected onto a style-free space, where the writer-independent classifier needs no change to classify the transformed data and can achieve significantly higher accuracy. The framework of STM can be combined with different types of classifiers for supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised adaptation, where writer-specific data can be either labeled or unlabeled and need not cover all classes. In this paper, we combine STM with the state-of-the-art classifiers for large-category Chinese handwriting recognition: learning vector quantization (LVQ) and modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF). Experiments on the online Chinese handwriting database CASIA-OLHWDB demonstrate that STM-based adaptation is very efficient and effective in improving classification accuracy. Semi-supervised adaptation achieves the best performance, while unsupervised adaptation is even better than supervised adaptation. On handwritten text data, semi-supervised adaptation achieves error reduction rates 31.95 and 25.00 percent by LVQ and MQDF, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.239","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6516859/06341757.pdf","startPage":"1773","endPage":"1787","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Writer Adaptation with Style Transfer Mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Writer Adaptation with Style Transfer Mapping","volume":"35","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13502193","pubMedId":"23682002","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6341757/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Writer Adaptation with Style Transfer Mapping","sourcePdf":"ttp2013071773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110014S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6516859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6516859","articleId":"6341757","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6341758,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Y.F.

A family of majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms is proposed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. A subset of scale parameters is driven to a small lower bound in the course of inference, with the effect of pruning the corresponding spurious components. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithms by performing extensive experiments on synthetic data, the swimmer dataset, a music decomposition example, and a stock price prediction task.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2012.240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6516859/06341758.pdf","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6516859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Relevance Determination in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the /spl beta/-Divergence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341758/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Relevance Determination in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the /spl beta/-Divergence","volume":"35","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13502194","pubMedId":"23681989","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341758/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Relevance Determination in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the /spl beta/-Divergence","sourcePdf":"ttp2013071592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103018S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6516859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"6516859","articleId":"6341758","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6341759,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie Shotton","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6648559/6341759/6341759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jamie Shotton received the BA degree in computer science and the PhD degree in computer vision from the University of Cambridge, and worked as a postdoctoral Toshiba fellow at Toshiba's Corporate Research and Development Center in Japan.

Both can quickly and accurately predict the 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image without using any temporal information. The key to both approaches is the use of a large, realistic, and highly varied synthetic set of training images. This allows us to learn models that are largely invariant to factors such as pose, body shape, field-of-view cropping, and clothing. Our first approach employs an intermediate body parts representation, designed so that an accurate per-pixel classification of the parts will localize the joints of the body. The second approach instead directly regresses the positions of body joints. By using simple depth pixel comparison features and parallelizable decision forests, both approaches can run super-real time on consumer hardware. Our evaluation investigates many aspects of our methods, and compares the approaches to each other and to the state of the art. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13875534","htmlLink":"/document/6341759/","pubMedId":"24136424","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Human Pose Estimation from Single Depth Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Human Pose Estimation from Single Depth Images","sourcePdf":"ttp2013122821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15121S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6648559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"6648559","articleId":"6341759","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6341763,"authors":[{"name":"Yasutaka Kamei","affiliation":["Graduate School and Faculty of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Nishi, Fukuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/6519220/6341763/6341763-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasutaka Kamei received the BE degree in 2005 in informatics from Kansai University, and the ME degree in 2007, and PhD degree in 2009 in information science from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.

However, once the critical files or packages have been identified, developers still need to spend considerable time drilling down to the functions or even code snippets that should be reviewed or tested. This makes the approach too time consuming and impractical for large software systems. Instead, we consider defect prediction models that focus on identifying defect-prone (\u201crisky\u201d) software changes instead of files or packages. We refer to this type of quality assurance activity as \u201cJust-In-Time Quality Assurance,\u201d because developers can review and test these risky changes while they are still fresh in their minds (i.e., at check-in time). To build a change risk model, we use a wide range of factors based on the characteristics of a software change, such as the number of added lines, and developer experience. A large-scale study of six open source and five commercial projects from multiple domains shows that our models can predict whether or not a change will lead to a defect with an average accuracy of 68 percent and an average recall of 64 percent. Furthermore, when considering the effort needed to review changes, we find that using only 20 percent of the effort it would take to inspect all changes, we can identify 35 percent of all defect-inducing changes. Our findings indicate that \u201cJust-In-Time Quality Assurance\u201d may provide an effort-reducing way to focus on the most risky changes and thus reduce the costs of developing high-quality software.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2012.70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/6519220/06341763.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6519220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2012.70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A large-scale empirical study of just-in-time quality assurance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"A large-scale empirical study of just-in-time quality assurance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341763/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13518261","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341763/","volume":"39","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large-scale empirical study of just-in-time quality assurance","sourcePdf":"tts2013060757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135654S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6519220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6519220","articleId":"6341763","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6341767,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Hemesi","affiliation":["Radio Communications Center of Excellence Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6341767/6341767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Hemesi was born in Arak, Iran, in 1982.

Each band is licensed to a distinct delay-sensitive primary user (PU) interested in meeting a minimum rate guarantee for delay-sensitive services with a maximum allowable primary outage probability or a primary outage constraint (POC) . Typically, a PU is oblivious to the SU's existence and has its own power policy based on the channel side information (CSI) of its direct gain between the PU transmitter and the PU receiver only. Under the assumption that the SU knows PUs' power policies and CSI of the entire network, we solve the SU's ergodic capacity maximization problem subject to SU's average transmit power and outage probability constraints (SOC) and all POCs or the so-called service-outage based capacity maximization for SU with POCs. We use a rigorous probabilistic power allocation technique that allows us to derive optimal power policies applicable to both continuous and discrete fading channels. Also, a suboptimal power control policy is proposed in order to avoid the high computational complexity of the optimal policy when N is large. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the power allocation algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","volume":"61","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"13355156","publicationDate":"February 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341770/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Service-Outage Capacity Maximization in Cognitive Radio for Parallel Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service-Outage Capacity Maximization in Cognitive Radio for Parallel Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"507-tc1302-athipat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090598S","chronDate":"February  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6473967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6473967","articleId":"6341770","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341775,"authors":[{"name":"Jouko Leinonen","affiliation":["Ericsson Research and Development Center, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6451308/6341775/6341775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jouko Leinonen (S'03-M'12) received his M.

A \u201cdigital\u201d electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics system with integrated optical sensors is a promising platform for portable POC diagnostic devices that integrate sample preparation with sensing. Herein is reported the highest sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) microresonator sensor integrated with an EWD system to date [FOM is the product of the quality (Q) factor and the sensitivity (S)]. The EWD system embedded microresonator sensor had a measured FOM of 0.60 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n nm/RIU (Q = 8,400, S = 72 nm/RIU) in 2-cSt silicone oil and water, which is nearly double the best FOM previously reported for an microresonator placed on top of an EWD system.

This paper presents a novel optimal design of the PID controller in the AVR system by using the Taguchi combined genetic algorithm (TCGA) method. A multiobjective design optimization is introduced to minimize the maximum percentage overshoot, the rise time, the settling time, and the steady-state error of the terminal voltage of the synchronous generator. The proportional gain, the integral gain, the derivative gain, and the saturation limit define the search space for the optimization problem. The approximate optimum values of the design variables are determined by the Taguchi method using analysis of means. Analysis of variance is used to select the two most influential design variables. A multiobjective GA is used to obtain the accurate optimum values of these two variables. MATLAB toolboxes are used for this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed method is then compared with that of the earlier GA method and the particle swarm optimization method. With this proposed TCGA method, the step response of the AVR system can be improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13796267","htmlLink":"/document/6341788/","displayDocTitle":"Design Optimization of PID Controller in Automatic Voltage Regulator System Using Taguchi Combined Genetic Algorithm Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Optimization of PID Controller in Automatic Voltage Regulator System Using Taguchi Combined Genetic Algorithm Method","sourcePdf":"jsyst-hasanien-2219912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07544S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6612648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6612648","articleId":"6341788","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6341796,"authors":[{"name":"Mark D.

Unbalance detection is formulated as a hypothesis test under a framework of detection theory and solved by applying a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT).

A nonquadratic avoidance cost is innovatively constructed via an inverse optimal control approach, which leads to an analytical, distributed, and optimal formation control law. The stability and optimality of the closed-loop system are proven. In addition, the proposed optimal control law is dependent only on the information from the local neighbors, rather than all UAVs' information.

Therefore, we exploit the concept of all-pairs (AP), a.k.a. all-versus-all, classification using binary classifiers for each pair of classes. This benefits from less complex decision boundaries to be learned, as opposed to a direct multiclass approach, and achieves a higher efficiency in terms of incremental training time than one-versus-rest classification techniques. For the binary classifiers, we apply fuzzy classifiers with singleton class labels in the consequences, as well as Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models to conduct regression on [0, 1] for each class pair. Both are evolved and incrementally trained in a data-streaming context, yielding a permanent update of the whole AP collection of classifiers, thus being able to properly react to dynamic changes in the streams. The classification phase considers a novel strategy by using the preference levels of each pair of classes that are collected in a preference relation matrix and performing a weighted voting scheme on this matrix. This is done by investigating the reliability of the classifiers in their predictions: 1) integrating the degree of ignorance on samples to be classified as weights for the preference levels and 2) new conflict models used in the single binary classifiers and when calculating the final class response based on the preference relation matrix. The advantage of the new EFC concept over the single model (using a direct multiclass classification concept) and multimodel architectures (using a one-versus-rest classification concept) will be underlined by empirical evaluations and comparisons at the end of this paper based on high-dimensional real-world multiclass classification problems. The results also show that integrating conflict and ignorance concepts into the preference relations can boost classifier accuracies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13692636","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6341816/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliable All-Pairs Evolving Fuzzy Classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable All-Pairs Evolving Fuzzy Classifiers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lughofer-2226892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113438S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6572863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6572863","articleId":"6341816","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6341831,"authors":[{"name":"Shihua Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6631519/6341831/6341831-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shihua Li (M'05\u2014SM'10) was born in Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province, China in 1975.

By introducing a non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold, a novel terminal sliding mode controller is designed for the speed loop. This controller can make the states not only reach the manifold in finite time, but also converge to the equilibrium point in finite time. Thus, the controller could make the motor speed reach the reference value in finite time, obtaining a faster convergence and a better tracking precision. Meanwhile, considering the large chattering phenomenon caused by high switching gains, a composite terminal sliding mode control method based on disturbance observer is proposed to reduce chattering. Through disturbance estimation for feed-forward compensation, the composite terminal sliding mode controller may take a smaller value for the switching gain without sacrificing disturbance rejection performance. Matlab simulation and TMS320F2808 DSP experimental results are provided to show the superiority of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2012.2226896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6631519/06341831.pdf","startPage":"1879","endPage":"1891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2012.2226896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of Terminal Sliding Mode Control Method for PMSM Speed Regulation System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341831/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Terminal Sliding Mode Control Method for PMSM Speed Regulation System","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13843475","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341831/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Terminal Sliding Mode Control Method for PMSM Speed Regulation System","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2226896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09147S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6631519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"275","xplore-issue":"6631519","articleId":"6341831","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6341833,"authors":[{"name":"Henrik Sax\u00e9n","affiliation":["Thermal and Flow Engineering Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, \u00c5bo Akademi University, Abo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6631519/6341833/6341833-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henrik Sax\u00e9n (M'93) received the M.Sc. and Dr. degrees in chemical engineering from \u00c5bo Akademi University, \u00c5bo, Finland, in 1983 and 1988, respectively.","Since 1997 he has been Professor in Heat Engineering at the Department of Chemical Engineering at \u00c5bo Akademi University.","Dr. Sax\u00e9n is an editorial member of two international journals and guest editor of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics and ISIJ International.

By this method, ultrasonic excitation signals from multiple sources are transmitted simultaneously to probe the objects immersed in the medium. The scattering signals are recorded by multiple receivers. Utilizing the nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation equation and the received time domain scattered signals, the objects are to be reconstructed iteratively in three steps. First, the propagation step calculates the predicted acoustic potential data at the receivers using an initial guess. Second, the difference signal between the predicted value and the measured data is calculated. Third, the backpropagation step computes updated acoustical potential data by backpropagating the difference signal to the same medium computationally. Unlike the conventional PBP method for tomographic imaging where each source takes turns to excite the acoustical field until all the sources are used, the developed MIMO-PBP method achieves faster image reconstruction by utilizing multiple source simultaneous excitation. Furthermore, we develop an orthogonal waveform signaling method using a waveform delay scheme to reduce the impact of speckle patterns in the reconstructed images. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-PBP tomographic imaging method results in faster convergence and achieves superior imaging quality.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2012.2226901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6421028/06341837.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2226901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6421028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Nonlinear Ultrasonic Tomography by Propagation and Backpropagation Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341837/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Nonlinear Ultrasonic Tomography by Propagation and Backpropagation Method","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13256704","pubMedId":"23193234","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341837/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Nonlinear Ultrasonic Tomography by Propagation and Backpropagation Method","sourcePdf":"tip-jin-2226901-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121012S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6421028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6421028","articleId":"6341837","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6341845,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Among them, the one based on the concept of sliding mode has been shown promising due to its robustness to matched uncertainties, but leaving the required state estimation to be desired. Previous studies show that the PEA can be modeled as a linear dynamic system with matched uncertainties. On this basis, this paper presents the development of a novel observer based on the concept of proportional-integral-derivative-based (PID-based) sliding mode, in which the switching function is replaced by a PID regulator. The novel observer, referred to as the PID-based sliding mode observer (PIDSMO), relaxes the observer matching condition as required in the use of the unknown-input observers. The PIDSMO is then integrated with the PID-based sliding mode controller (PIDSMC) to form a novel integrated PID-based sliding mode observer-controller (PIDSMOC) for PEA tracking control. Experiments performed on a PEA showed that the PIDSMO can accurately estimate the PEA states and that the integrated PIDSMOC can achieve better tracking control performances as compared to the PIDSMC with \u03b1-\u03b2 filter control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222428","startPage":"88","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2012.2222428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6716101/06341845.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated PID-Based Sliding Mode State Estimation and Control for Piezoelectric Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341845/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrated PID-Based Sliding Mode State Estimation and Control for Piezoelectric Actuators","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6341845/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14032795","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated PID-Based Sliding Mode State Estimation and Control for Piezoelectric Actuators","sourcePdf":"tmech-peng-2222428-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085598S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6716101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6716101","articleId":"6341845","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6341846,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratory of Systems Integration, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6403574/6341846/6341846-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon (S\u201910\u2013M\u201911) recei-ved the Electrical Engineer degree from Ecole Superieure de Chimie Physique et Electronique de Lyon, Lyon, France, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree Institut national des sciences appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon, Lyon, France, 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Lyon, Lyon, France, 2011.","He is currently with The \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, with Pr.

The three-level-stacked neutral point clamped (3L-SNPC) structure is a derivative of 3L-NPC providing more advantages such as a double apparent switching frequency and parallel load current paths. In this paper, the power loss distribution and features of 3L-SNPC are analyzed first when applied to solar inverters. Based on the analysis, a novel 3L-SNPC leg structure is proposed for solar applications in order to reduce the power loss particularly for the low power range, given the fact that solar inverters generally operate in the low power range during most of the daytime. Then, a two-stage solar inverter topology, applying the proposed structure to the phase leg, is described. Further, a split phase controller is applied for the two-stage solar inverter, consisting of the maximum power point tracking control, optimized dc-link voltage control, and grid current control. Finally, a new dead-time elimination pulsewidth modulation strategy is proposed and conveniently implemented to each phase based on the split phase controller. Experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed topology and controller.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2226475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2226475","startPage":"2856","endPage":"2866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6376188/06341850.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Three-Phase Three-Level-Stacked Neutral Point Clamped Grid-Tied Solar Inverter With a Split Phase Controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Novel Three-Phase Three-Level-Stacked Neutral Point Clamped Grid-Tied Solar Inverter With a Split Phase Controller","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2012","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341850/","accessionNumber":"13167908","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341850/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Three-Phase Three-Level-Stacked Neutral Point Clamped Grid-Tied Solar Inverter With a Split Phase Controller","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2226475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087061S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6376188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6376188","articleId":"6341850","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6341851,"authors":[{"name":"Yongchang Zhang","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motor Drives Engineering Research Center of Beijing, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6392980/6341851/6341851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongchang Zhang (M'10) received the B.S. degree from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, both in electrical engineering.","From August 2009 to August 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Technology Sydney, where he was engaged in permanent magnet synchronous motor drives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and control of doubly fed induction generator for wind energy applications.

This paper proposes an improved DPC for three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier with simple calculation. The concept of duty cycle control is introduced in DPC to allocate only a fraction of control period to the voltage vector selected from conventional switching table in DPC, while a null vector is applied for the rest of time. The main advantages of the proposed duty cycle control are twofold. On one hand, it is independent of rectifier parameter such as line-side inductance, hence strong robustness against inductance variations is obtained. On the other hand, the principle to obtain the duty cycle is very simple and easy to implement. Compared to conventional DPC, significant power ripple reduction and more sinusoidal grid current can be observed in the improved DPC. The presented simulation results and laboratory tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6392980/06341851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2222050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6392980","startPage":"3428","endPage":"3437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement of Direct Power Control of PWM Rectifier With Simple Calculation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of Direct Power Control of PWM Rectifier With Simple Calculation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191085","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6341851/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of Direct Power Control of PWM Rectifier With Simple Calculation","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2222050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085718S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6341851","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6341855,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Shettigar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6392234/6341855/6341855-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pradeep Shettigar (M'12) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore, in 2006.

The approach is based on measuring a closed-loop frequency response representing the linearization of the circuit about a steady-state solution. Critical poles of the amplifier are then obtained by applying conventional pole-zero identification techniques to the measured frequency response. As circuit parameters are modified, the evolution of these critical poles on the complex plane provides a practical way to assess the robustness of the design regarding its stability. Two types of common instabilities in microwave amplifiers are studied: low-frequency bias oscillations and parametric oscillations. For the low-frequency oscillations, the approach proposes the inclusion of an observation RF port into the amplifier bias path to experimentally obtain the critical poles of the circuit from a reflection coefficient measurement. Pole-placement techniques are then applied to increase the stability margin of detected critical resonances. For the parametric oscillations, pole-zero identification is applied to a frequency response obtained from a mixer-like characterization equivalent to the measurement of a \u201chot\u201d reflection coefficient. The methodology is applied to two amplifier prototypes: an \n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L$</tex></formula>\n-band field-effect transistor amplifier and a dual-mode WiFi-WIMAX amplifier that exhibit different kinds of unstable behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13187894","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Characterization of Stability Margins in Microwave Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Characterization of Stability Margins in Microwave Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-anakabe-2221736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05219S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6384897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6341866","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6341870,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Historical hourly wind speed, solar irradiance, and load data are used to stochastically model the wind generation, photovoltaic generation, and load. Using fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, these data are grouped into 10 clusters of days with similar data points to account for seasonal variations. In order to minimize cost and increase efficiency, we use a GA-based optimization approach together with a two-point estimate method. Minimizing the cost function guarantees minimum PV and wind generation installation as well as storage capacity selection to supply the HVAC load. Different scenarios are examined to evaluate the efficiency of the system with different percentages of load shifting. The maximum capacity of the storage system and excess energy are calculated as the most important indices for energy efficiency assessment. The cumulative distribution functions of these indices are plotted and compared. A smart-grid strategy is developed for matching renewable energy generation (solar and wind) with the HVAC load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13188744","volume":"28","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6341870/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic-Algorithm-Based Optimization Approach for Energy Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic-Algorithm-Based Optimization Approach for Energy Management","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-etezadiamoli-2219598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101637S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6389787","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"221","xplore-issue":"6389787","articleId":"6341870","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":6341872,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6504806/6341872/6341872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Liu (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree from Yanshan University, Qinghuangdao, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008, both in electrical engineering.

To evaluate the contribution of the VSC-HVDC link on the voltage stability of HMIDC system, this paper proposes an effective short circuit ratio (ESCR) calculation method. Through the calculation, the voltage support capability of the VSC-HVDC link can be quantitatively represented by the ESCR. Furthermore, based on the calculation results, a flexible power control strategy for the VSC-HVDC link is developed to provide maximum reactive power support under grid faults. The theoretical analysis of the HMIDC system is based on the Danish transmission grid, evaluated through PSCAD simulations under different grid fault conditions. Simulation results are presented to validate the expected performance of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341872/","volume":"28","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6341872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13934116","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Power Control Method of VSC-HVDC Link for the Enhancement of Effective Short-Circuit Ratio in a Hybrid Multi-Infeed HVDC System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Power Control Method of VSC-HVDC Link for the Enhancement of Effective Short-Circuit Ratio in a Hybrid Multi-Infeed HVDC System","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-liu-2222057-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081693S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6341872","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6341873,"authors":[{"name":"Innocent Kamwa","affiliation":["Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec/IREQ, Power System and Mathematics, Varennes, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6504806/6341873/6341873-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Innocent Kamwa (S'83\u2013M'88\u2013SM'98\u2013F'05) received the Ph.D. degree from Laval University, Qu\u00e9bec City, QC, Canada, in 1988.","He then joined Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's research institute (IREQ), where he is currently project manager for power grid control and automation.

This paper attempts to determine whether fulfilling these requirements makes the PMU inherently well suited for stability control applications such as wide-area power system stabilizers (PSSs). In this aim, we considered two different frequency-adaptive approaches for class-P and -M compliance to ensure operation over a wide frequency range. The first is based on a finite-impulse response (FIR) with no overshoot in either the phase or the amplitude step responses, while the second is Kalman filter-based (EKF), which allows for a more refined out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot. These two approaches are benchmarked against Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec`s existing PSS requirements and the conclusion is that the total vector error-based response time is not indicative of the phase lag within the frequency band of interest, nor of the 3-dB bandwidth under sinusoidal amplitude/frequency modulation phenomena, which are key criteria when specifying PSS PMUs. Using simulated and field-recorded network fault responses, we also show that a class-M PMU is unsatisfactory for wide-area stabilizing control, unless its performance is improved during the fault period, which is not covered by Std.

The simulation results show that the performance of the OFDM systems in DSTC-coded cooperative network can be improved further using subcarrier pairing strategy compared with no subcarrier pairing strategy.","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6341911","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06341911.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6341911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Performance of DSTC-Coded OFDM Relay Link by Subcarrier Pairing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6341911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6341911/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Performance of DSTC-Coded OFDM Relay Link by Subcarrier Pairing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118190","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6341911/","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Performance of DSTC-Coded OFDM Relay Link by Subcarrier Pairing","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1123952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047889S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6341911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6341958,"authors":[{"name":"Meixiang Zhang","affiliation":["Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Meixiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240488900"},{"name":"Sooyoung Kim","affiliation":["Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279282600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6341958","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Matrix decomposition","Vectors","Turbo codes","Modulation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","modulation","space division multiplexing","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft MIMO detection","multi-input multi-output system","turbo codes","QR decomposition","channel matrix","spatial multiplexing","maximum likelihood soft detection","ML soft detection scheme","antennas","modulation order","soft demapping scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new soft detection scheme for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with turbo codes, which inherently requires soft input information from the MIMO detection part.

Although the maximum performance can be achieved using the ML soft detection scheme, the complexity increases exponentially with the number of antennas and modulation orders. In this paper, we first detect the signal in a symbol level with QR decomposition of the channel matrix, and then apply soft demapping scheme with proper channel gains.

A smart antenna is an array of antenna elements that can modify the array pattern adaptively to minimize the effect of noise, multiple access interference of other users, and multipath. PN code acquisition using a fixed threshold may lead to an excessive number of false alarms, and thus, adaptive thresholding TM-CFAR processing is considered.

In multi-Tx multi-Rx (MTMR) MIMO system, each eNodeB transmits data to different users simultaneously. When applying multi-user MIMO precoding to eliminate the intra-cell interference, the data detection scheme of MTMR MIMO is the same as traditional single-eNodeB single-user MIMO. The optimal detection of MIMO system is understood to be achieved by maximum-likelihood (ML) detection in theory. However, the computation complexity of ML detection is prohibitive. In this paper, we use minimum-mean-square-error based ordered successive interference cancellation (MMSE-OSIC) solution as an initial guess. Then, we use the SNR and SINR under which these initial estimations are derived as a reference to weight the effectiveness of these solutions. This effectiveness is used to decide the search range of the consequent ML estimation. In the ML estimation, QR decomposition is used to diagonalize the channel matrix. In each level, only limited points around the MMSE-OSIC solution point in the M-ary QAM constellation are examined as compared with a full search. At the end of each level, only M most significant symbol combinations are retained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06342022.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6342022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Search in QRD-M for Complexity Reduction in MIMO X Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Complexity theory","Array signal processing","Antennas","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiplexing","precoding","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive search","QR decomposition","QRD-M","complexity reduction","MIMO X channel","long term evolution-advanced","3GPP LTE","multiple-input multiple-output spatial multiplexing","spectrum efficiency","intercell interference elimination","coordinated multipoint","CoMP","eNodeB","multiuser MIMO precoding","data detection scheme","maximum likelihood detection","computation complexity","minimum mean square error","successive interference cancellation","M-ary QAM constellation","channel matrix","multi-Tx multi-Rx MIMO system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Search in QRD-M for Complexity Reduction in MIMO X Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342022/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118297","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Search in QRD-M for Complexity Reduction in MIMO X Channel","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1127248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040099S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6342022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6342023,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Jing","firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Jing","id":"37086757837"},{"name":"Zhong-guang Fu","firstName":"Zhong-guang","lastName":"Fu","id":"37531540200"},{"name":"Min-fang Qi","firstName":"Min-fang","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086759976"},{"name":"JIan-xing Wang","firstName":"JIan-xing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087066868"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6342023","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342023","abstract":"The calorific value of coal is an important factor for the economic operation of coal fired power plant. However calorific value is tremendous difference between the different coal, and even if coal is from the same mine. Restricted by the coal market, most of coal fired power plants can not burn the designed-coal by now in China. The properties of coal as received are changing so frequently that pulverized coal firing is always with the unexpected condition. Therefore, the researches on the on-line prediction of calorific value of coal has a profound significance for the economic operation of power plants. Aiming at the problem of uncertainty of calorific value of coal, a soft measurement model for calorific value of coal is proposed based on the BP neural network with appropriate optimization. It is shown by an example that the optimized model, which could be established at a high rate of speed, was at the higher training accuracy and with generalization ability. The model could provide a good guidance for the calculation of the calorific value of coal and optimization operation of coal fired power plants.","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342023","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06342023.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6342023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction Research Based on the Optimized BP Neural Network for Coal Calorific Value","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coal","Neural networks","Training","Data models","Optimization","Power generation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","coal","neural nets","power engineering computing","steam power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction research","optimized BP neural network","coal calorific value","coal fired power plant","China","on-line prediction","economic operation","power plants"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Prediction Research Based on the Optimized BP Neural Network for Coal Calorific Value","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342023/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118298","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction Research Based on the Optimized BP Neural Network for Coal Calorific Value","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1126998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044475S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6342023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6342027,"authors":[{"name":"Yanchao Yang","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Yanchao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37539123700"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37532166700"},{"name":"Congbin Liu","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Congbin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38497952500"},{"name":"Zhongli Lan","affiliation":["Information Institute, Southwest University, Mian Yang, China"],"firstName":"Zhongli","lastName":"Lan","id":"38498067900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6342027","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Delay","Adaptation models","Training","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decision making","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","Pareto optimisation","radial basis function networks","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio engine","genetic algorithm","radial basis function neural network","intelligent wireless communication system","core technology","reasoning methods","artificial intelligence","multiobjective optimization","RBF neural network","dynamical wireless environment","decision-making","RBF learning model","Pareto set","benchmark functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342027","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342027","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is an intelligent wireless communication system which can dynamically adjust the parameters to improve system performance depending on the environmental change and quality of service.

For this, CR has to identify opportunistically and heuristically the available spectrum, in which primary users (PUs) do not exist on it. It is critical that the secondary users (SUs) use the vacant portions of the spectrum without causing a loss of efficiency for PUs and without any interference effects on PUs in CR networks. Among the recent research on CR MAC protocols, we focused on the selection of rendezvous channel (RC), which is the core of the Cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol.

The fading gain value in each subchannel is partitioned into a number of regions by which the modulation is adapted in terms of the region the fading gain falls in. The fading gain region boundaries are attained for attaining maximum spectral efficiency (SE) under a target bit error rate (BER) constraint. Based on accurate BER expression, the improved switching thresholds for the AM are proposed. By the switching thresholds, we obtain accurate closed-form expressions of the SE and average BER. With these expressions, the system performance can be effectively evaluated. Simulation results show that the SE based on the improved switching thresholds is higher than that based on the conventional ones, and the derived theoretical SE and BER are in good agreement with the corresponding simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06342040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6342040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-Rate Adaptive Modulation for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Space-Frequency Block Code in Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Modulation","Switches","Adaptive systems","Fading","Simulation","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","block codes","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-rate adaptive modulation","MIMO-OFDM system","space-frequency block code","Rayleigh fading channel","AM","SFBC","subchannel fading gain value","fading gain region boundary","maximum spectral efficiency","SE","target bit error rate constraint","BER","switching threshold","closed-form expression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-Rate Adaptive Modulation for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Space-Frequency Block Code in Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118315","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-Rate Adaptive Modulation for MIMO-OFDM Systems with Space-Frequency Block Code in Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1125142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054543S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6342040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342053,"authors":[{"name":"Dure-Shahwar Kundi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Dure-Shahwar","lastName":"Kundi","id":"38501346400"},{"name":"Arshad Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Arshad","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37594566400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6342053","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Implementation of Skein-256 Hash Function on FPGA","abstract":"In this paper we have presented a low-area design of Skein-256 hash function on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA.

Firstly, the entire distribution network is divided into a main branch and a number of independent regions by making use of the radiation-like characteristic of distribution network. Then, the information of fault current is used to found out fault independent region. Finally, genetic algorithm is applied to locate faults for the main branch and fault regions. So, the dimension of feasible solution can be reduced largely and the location speed can be enhanced. In the simulation experiments of fault location by this method for a distribution network system, the results show that the location method is fast and accurate to locate faults.

The theory compressed sensing combines the sampling and compressing together under the assumption that the signal is compressible or sparse in a certain sparse transform domain.Compressed sensing needs fewer measurements and it can successfully recover original signal using an optimization process,which will greatly reduce the complexity of sampling and calculation.Since traditional algorithm to sample the whole image is time-consuming and it requires huge storage space,we study block compressed sensing.According to the properties of coefficients, only the high-pass coefficients are measured,then the original image is reconstructed using the orthogonal matching pursuit method.Compared with the original algorithm, simulation result demonstrates that high resolution image can be obtained with the proposed algorithm,which reduces the sampling and storage data.The quality of the reconstruction image is greatly improved.","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342118","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06342118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6342118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Image Reconstruction Based on Block Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Image Reconstruction Based on Block Compressed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342118/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118387","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342118/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Image Reconstruction Based on Block Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1125378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054152S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6342118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6342129,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yu","firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37087066704"},{"name":"YongJun Liu","firstName":"YongJun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087066830"},{"name":"Hanying Hu","firstName":"Hanying","lastName":"Hu","id":"37087066790"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1964-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1965-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1963-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6342129","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"This paper investigates the uplink-downlink duality under bounded channel uncertainties in the multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems.

An online signature is a behavioral biometric that still has some limitations to be applicable like other biometric identification because of its behavioral nature. So, new algorithms and solutions are still required. This paper presents a new technique by combining Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) technique and the probabilistic model to overcome some drawbacks of using a single model individually. The probabilistic model is used to classify the global features, while BPNN is used to classify the local features. \"AND\" fusion is used to combine the two mentioned techniques to obtain the final decision. The dataset used to test and evaluate the proposed method is the SVC2004 dataset which is a well known dataset. The proposed technique was evaluated in terms of False Rejection Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR) that are 0.3% and 0.5% respectively.

In this paper, preamble-aided estimation and compensation of I/Q imbalance with filter mismatch are proposed to enhance signal quality and link reliability for 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed preamble-aided estimation is able to detect filter, gain and phase mismatches by using the cross-ratio property of preambles. Then the estimated result is programmed to correct this distortion. Through simulations in frequency-selective fading, they hint that this solution can solve I/Q imbalance with 2 dB gain error, 20\u00b0 phase error and 180\u00b0 filter mismatch.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340510/6341887/06342153.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2012 Spring Congress on Engineering and Technology","doi":"10.1109/SCET.2012.6342153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCET.2012.6342153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance Compensator for 2x2 MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Gain","MIMO","Fading","Antennas","Receivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filters","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance compensator","MIMO-OFDM systems","radio frequency imperfections","DC offset","frequency offset","filter mismatch","signal quality","link reliability","preamble-aided estimation","cross-ratio property"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 May 2012","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance Compensator for 2x2 MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342153/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"13118421","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalance Compensator for 2x2 MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"pid1124514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058923S","chronDate":"27-30 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340510","isNumber":"6341887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340510","xplore-issue":"6341887","articleId":"6342153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6342164,"authors":[{"name":"Zheyu Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Ultra-wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Zheyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38510935500"},{"name":"Weimin Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Ultra-wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38508494700"},{"name":"Fred Wang","affiliation":["Center for Ultra-wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Wang","id":"37277654900"},{"name":"Leon M.

However, due to the limitation of gate driver capability and the interaction between two devices in a phase-leg during switching transient (cross talk), the switching speed is slower than expected in practical use. This paper focuses on identifying the key limiting factors for switching speed. The results provide the basis for improving gate drivers, eliminating interference, and boosting switching speed. Based on the EPC2001 Gallium Nitride transistor, both simulation and experimental results verify that the limiting factors in the gate loop include the pull-up (-down) resistance of gate driver, rise (fall) time and amplitude of gate driver output voltage; among these the rise (fall) time plays the primary role. Another important limiting factor of device switching speed is the spurious gate voltage induced by cross talk between two switches in a phase-leg. This induced gate voltage is not only determined by the switch speed, but also depends on the gate loop impedance, junction capacitance, and operating conditions of the complementary device.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342164","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342164.pdf","startPage":"3950","endPage":"3955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the switching speed limitation of wide band-gap devices in a phase-leg configuration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342164/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the switching speed limitation of wide band-gap devices in a phase-leg configuration","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13119743","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342164/","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the switching speed limitation of wide band-gap devices in a phase-leg configuration","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5621950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074047S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342173,"authors":[{"name":"Yanick Lobsiger","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yanick","lastName":"Lobsiger","id":"38507111100"},{"name":"Johann W.

The system replacement and maintenance costs are high considering the high cost of the LED lamps which are mostly functional. Existing techniques include the total elimination of electrolytic capacitor and the sole use of passive components within a single LED lamp system. In this paper, we propose a contactless LED ballast based on loosely coupled transformer, which isolates electrically the primary and the secondary circuits without mechanical contact. The primary circuit includes ordinary lifetime storage capacitor, main switching components, and control circuitries. The secondary circuit contains the long lifetime LED lamps and passive components. So the system maintenance can be tailored for the different failure-and-replacement cycles of the active primary circuitry and the passive secondary LED lamps to optimize overall system lifetime. In addition, the system is suitable for a total environmentally-shield secondary enclosure application. A primary equivalent voltage regulation and a secondary non-electrical positional dimming method based on the physical separation of the primary and secondary of the contactless transformer are used for brightness maintenance and control. Analysis, design and prototype verification are given for the LED ballast and dimming control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342247","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342247.pdf","startPage":"4235","endPage":"4241","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contactless electronic ballast for high brightness LED lamps with positionally dimmed method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Contactless electronic ballast for high brightness LED lamps with positionally dimmed method","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342247/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132574","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342247/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contactless electronic ballast for high brightness LED lamps with positionally dimmed method","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"6031386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054729S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342259,"authors":[{"name":"Khwaja Rahman","affiliation":["General Motors Global Electrification, Pontiac, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Khwaja","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37267000500"},{"name":"Sinisa Jurkovic","affiliation":["General Motors Global Electrification, Pontiac, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sinisa","lastName":"Jurkovic","id":"37590277900"},{"name":"Constantin Stancu","affiliation":["General Motors Global Electrification, Pontiac, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Stancu","id":"37270099900"},{"name":"John Morgante","affiliation":["General Motors Global Electrification, Pontiac, MI, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Morgante","id":"38497397700"},{"name":"Peter Savagian","affiliation":["General Motors Global Electrification, Pontiac, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Savagian","id":"38502417600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342259","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Windings","Permanent magnet motors","Rotors","Stator windings","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric propulsion","electric vehicles","permanent magnet generators","permanent magnet motors","skin effect","stators","synchronous generators","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended range electric vehicle","EREV","Chevrolet Voltec electric propulsion system","motor","generator","Voltec electric drive system","permanent magnet AC synchronous machine","rotor","distributed windings","stranded winding","Chevrolet Volt motor","bar-wound construction","proximity effects","skin effects","stator winding losses","full EV driving","short end-turn length","machine packaging","machine design","acoustic noise performances","electromagnetic performances","measured thermal performances"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design and performance details of the Chevrolet Voltec electric propulsion system. The propulsion system has two machines, one machine is operating mostly as a motor while the other machine is operating mostly as a generator. Both machines of the Voltec electric drive system are permanent magnet AC synchronous machine types with the magnets buried inside the rotor. The motor has distributed windings. However, as opposed to a conventional stranded winding the Chevrolet Volt motor has bar-wound construction to improve the motor performance, especially in the low to medium speed range. At higher speed the skin and proximity effects in the stator bars lead to increased stator winding losses but are addressed in the design. The bar-wound construction also has excellent thermal performance, in both the steady-state and the transient conditions, necessary for full EV driving. The generator uses concentrated windings. The concentrated winding construction has good slot fill and short end-turn length. These features resulted in good performance in the intended operational region and were an enabler for machine packaging inside the transmission. Both the machines exhibit excellent efficiency and exceptionally smooth and quiet operation.

Addressing this need, this paper presents the experimental verification of the Generalized Nyquist stability Criterion (GNC) for balanced three-phase ac systems. This criterion, developed by MacFarlane and Postlethwaite in the 1970's, was proposed as a stability analysis tool for ac interfaces in the d-q frame in the late 1990's. Since then, however, very few papers have addressed the verification of this theory in a real power system given the intricacies of three-phase impedance measurement in the d-q frame. In this paper, a voltage source inverter feeding a boost rectifier is used to implement an experimental balanced three-phase system, where by adjusting their respective control bandwidths, stable and unstable cases are found at their ac interface. To this end, the d-q frame impedances of both converters are measured, and the GNC is applied, showing how both stable and unstable cases can be effectively predicted.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342298","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","startPage":"3926","endPage":"3933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental verification of the Generalized Nyquist stability criterion for balanced three-phase ac systems in the presence of constant power loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of the Generalized Nyquist stability criterion for balanced three-phase ac systems in the presence of constant power loads","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132618","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of the Generalized Nyquist stability criterion for balanced three-phase ac systems in the presence of constant power loads","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5591401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056811S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342300,"authors":[{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37424005500"},{"name":"Hua Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Lin","id":"37422009900"},{"name":"Bo Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Feng","id":"37290321800"},{"name":"Yongcan Lyu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yongcan","lastName":"Lyu","id":"38512070700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342300","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":738},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342300","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Resistors","Capacitors","Matrix converters","Resonant frequency","Inductors","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commutation","damping","matrix convertors","power harmonic filters","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductor capacitor filter","input LC filter resonance","virtual resistor","matrix converter","switching devices","input current harmonic mitigation","filter oscillation","modulation index","space vector modulation strategy","power efficiency"]}],"abstract":"An inductor-capacitor (LC) filter is normally required at the input of the matrix converter, to assist in the commutation of switching devices and to mitigate input current harmonics.

Improved topologies combined with gallium nitride (GaN) transistors can allow for lower loss at higher frequencies. A major barrier to further improvement is the transformer design. With high current levels and high frequency effects the transformers can become the major loss component in the circuit. This paper will study the impact of increased switching frequencies on transformer size, the ability of GaN transistors to increase switching frequency in high frequency resonant topologies, and propose an improved integrated transformer design that can decrease core loss and further improve the performance of traditional matrix transformers. The final demonstration being a Vin=48V, Vo=12V, Io=30A, 1.6MHz GaN converter with an improved integrated transformer offering a power density of 900W/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342302.pdf","startPage":"3895","endPage":"3902","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frequency isolated bus converter with gallium nitride transistors and integrated transformer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Transformer cores","Inductance","Gallium nitride","Resistance","Resonant frequency","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","gallium compounds","high-frequency transformers","III-V semiconductors","matrix algebra","transistors","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency isolated bus converter","transistors","integrated transformer","DC-DC converters","high current levels","switching frequency","high frequency resonant topology","core loss","matrix transformers","voltage 48 V","voltage 12 V","current 30 A","frequency 1.6 MHz","GaN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"High frequency isolated bus converter with gallium nitride transistors and integrated transformer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132622","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frequency isolated bus converter with gallium nitride transistors and integrated transformer","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5552190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054556S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342304,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas LaBella","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"LaBella","id":"38500008300"},{"name":"Ben York","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"York","id":"37543337500"},{"name":"Chris Hutchens","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Hutchens","id":"37403314100"},{"name":"Jih-Sheng Lai","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jih-Sheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37274695000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342304","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1907},"abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of losses that occur during dead time in an active-clamp flyback converter utilizing Gallium Nitride based MOSFETs. This analysis is used to optimize the length of the dead-time period in order to minimize losses in the switching devices. When compared to silicon-based MOSFETs, GaN-based MOSFETs have lower switching losses and much higher reverse conduction losses, so it is not desirable to design for zero-voltage switching (ZVS) over a wide load range. The analysis presented in this paper finds an optimal trade-off between partial ZVS and reverse conduction losses, minimizing overall device switching losses and therefore increasing converter efficiency over the desired load range. A 15-W, four-output active-clamp flyback converter utilizing GaN devices at 1 MHz is designed and implemented using the recommended optimization. The experimental results confirm this analysis and result in a minimization of switching losses and an increase in converter efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342304.pdf","startPage":"3882","endPage":"3889","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dead time optimization through loss analysis of an active-clamp flyback converter utilizing GaN devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Switches","Zero voltage switching","Inductors","FETs","Inductance","Discharges (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","power MOSFET","wide band gap semiconductors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dead time optimization","loss analysis","gallium nitride based MOSFET","dead-time period","switching devices","silicon-based MOSFET","zero-voltage switching","ZVS","four-output active-clamp flyback converter","switching loss minimization","power 15 W","frequency 1 MHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gallium Nitride","GaN FET","power density","active-clamp flyback converter","dead-time optimization","loss analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dead time optimization through loss analysis of an active-clamp flyback converter utilizing GaN devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132623","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dead time optimization through loss analysis of an active-clamp flyback converter utilizing GaN devices","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5531807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076566S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342313,"authors":[{"name":"Yijie Yu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yijie","lastName":"Yu","id":"37898837200"},{"name":"Fanghua Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fanghua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280275500"},{"name":"Jianjun Ni","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Ni","id":"37895244500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342313","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Capacitors","Topology","Voltage control","Clamps","Switches","Regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","electric potential","light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor clamped current sharing circuit","multistring LED","voltage drop tolerance","negative temperature coefficient","current imbalance problem","turn-on switch","multicapacitor charge conservation","three-string current sharing topology","low voltage stress","nonmagnetic component"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342313","abstract":"This paper proposes a simple capacitors clamped current sharing circuit for multi-string LEDs to solve the current imbalance problem caused by voltage drop tolerance and the negative temperature coefficient of LED, which employs staggered turn-on switches and multi-capacitor charge conservation.

This step prepares valid data to be used for building a prediction model. In the second step, a complex-valued recurrent neural network is applied to build a model to predict wind power. The test results of the prediction model are presented and analyzed at the end of the paper.

The V2G concept can improve the performance of the electricity grid in areas such as efficiency, stability, and reliability. A V2G-capable vehicle offers reactive power support, active power regulation, tracking of variable renewable energy sources, load balancing, and current harmonic filtering. These technologies can enable ancillary services, such as voltage and frequency control and spinning reserve. Costs of V2G include battery degradation, the need for intensive communication between the vehicles and the grid, effects on grid distribution equipment, infrastructure changes, and social, political, cultural and technical obstacles. Although V2G operation can reduce the lifetime of PEVs, it is projected to be more economical for vehicle owners and grid operators. This paper reviews these benefits and challenges of V2G technology for both individual vehicles and vehicle fleets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13132674","htmlLink":"/document/6342356/","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Review of benefits and challenges of vehicle-to-grid technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of benefits and challenges of vehicle-to-grid technology","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"4431848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117376S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6342358,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Il Kim","affiliation":["Micro Systems Lab., Material & Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Il","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086782977"},{"name":"Jinwoo Cho","affiliation":["Micro Systems Lab., Material & Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwoo","lastName":"Cho","id":"38547570100"},{"name":"Sunghyuk Park","affiliation":["Micro Systems Lab., Material & Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghyuk","lastName":"Park","id":"38548621800"},{"name":"Taesang Park","affiliation":["Micro Systems Lab., Material & Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"firstName":"Taesang","lastName":"Park","id":"37086628990"},{"name":"Seongtaek Lim","affiliation":["Micro Systems Lab., Material & Device Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"firstName":"Seongtaek","lastName":"Lim","id":"37067826300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342358","dbTime":"56 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traction motors","Magnetic flux","Reluctance motors","Torque","Rotors","Induction motors","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","traction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified spoke-type ferrite magnet motor","hybrid vehicles","low-speed electric vehicles","EV","induction motor","switched reluctance motor","spoke-type FMM","rotor configuration"]}],"abstract":"Rare-earth magnets have been widely employed for traction drive motors of hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs) due to high energy density.

In this paper, a modified spoke-type FMM with a novel rotor configuration is presented for a traction motor of low-speed EVs. The characteristics of the modified spoke-type FMM are numerically compared with a conventional spoke-type FMM at the same design condition.

The manuscript aims at triggering and stimulating the discussion on fault clearance options other than only CBs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132689","htmlLink":"/document/6342371/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Options for ground fault clearance in HVDC offshore networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Options for ground fault clearance in HVDC offshore networks","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"4151005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064702S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342385,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Dong","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Dong","id":"37588136900"},{"name":"Dushan Boroyevich","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dushan","lastName":"Boroyevich","id":"37274991300"},{"name":"Paolo Mattavelli","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Mattavelli","id":"37275807000"},{"name":"Bo Wen","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wen","id":"38502420200"},{"name":"Yaosuo Xue","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Technology, Siemens Corporation Research, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yaosuo","lastName":"Xue","id":"37536423800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342385","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Power system stability","Load modeling","Impedance","Stability criteria","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loops","power convertors","power grids","power system protection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antiislanding protection","three-phase converter","grid synchronization","small signal stability","islanding detection algorithms","grid interface converter","low-frequency small signal phase locked loop model","converter interaction","PLL stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Islanding detection","grid-interface converters","PLL"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the islanding detection algorithms for three-phase (3\u03a6) grid-interface converters based on the grid synchronization small-signal stability. To study the grid synchronization behavior at the islanded condition, a low-frequency small-signal phase-locked-loop (PLL) model is proposed by considering the converter interaction with the system impedances. Many of the frequency-related behaviors can be well explained and the crucial system parameters which impact the PLL stability are quantified by the proposed model as well. Based on the model, two islanding detection algorithms based on the small-signal stability theory are proposed to effectively detect the islanding event under the worst loading condition.

The ZCIH system consists of multiple working coils and multiple inverters to control the amplitude and phase angle of each coil current to obtain uniformity in the temperature profile across a workpiece. The ZCIH system makes it possible to control the heat distribution, resulting in a fast heating capability at high temperature conditions. This paper derives a relation between the coil currents and the heat generated on each zone, when the phase angle between coil currents are controlled. Based on the analysis, a new control method is proposed to control the generated heat across the workpiece by adjusting both amplitudes and phase angles of the coil currents. Experimental results clarified that the proposed method can control the heat generated on five zones using only three working coils. As a result, N working coils are possible to control the heat generated on 2N-1 zones, leading to a remarkable heat distribution improvement and/or a significant cost reduction in the ZCIH system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342403/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132720","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heat distribution control using current amplitude and phase angle in zone-control induction heating systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heat distribution control using current amplitude and phase angle in zone-control induction heating systems","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3571254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064885S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342408,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The dc-dc converter should operate at very high frequency to track an envelope in the MHz range to supply the power amplifier. One of the circuits suitable for this application is a hybrid topology composed of a switched converter and a linear regulator in series that work together to adjust the output voltage to track the envelope with accuracy. This topology can take advantage of the reduced slew-rate technique where switching dc-dc converter provides the RF envelope with limited slew rate in order to avoid high switching frequency and high power losses, while the linear regulator performs fine adjustment in order to obtain the exact replica of the RF envelope. The combination of this control technique with this topology is proposed in this paper. Envelopes with different bandwidth will be considered to optimize the efficiency of the dc-dc converter. The calculations and experiments have been done to track a 2MHz envelope in the range 0\u201312V for an EER RF transmitter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Radio frequency","Loss measurement","Power amplifiers","Regulators","Switches","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","power amplifiers","power control","radiofrequency amplifiers","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency dc-dc switching converters","envelope amplifier","hybrid series converter","slow-envelope technique","EER RF transmitters","power amplifier","hybrid topology","switched converter","linear regulator","reduced slew-rate technique","switching frequency","power loss","voltage 0 V to 12 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342420","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342420.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Envelope amplifier based on a hybrid series converter with the slow-envelope technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Envelope amplifier based on a hybrid series converter with the slow-envelope technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342420/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342420/","accessionNumber":"13132737","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Envelope amplifier based on a hybrid series converter with the slow-envelope technique","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0011585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051098S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342436,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Huang","affiliation":["Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management System Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37600925700"},{"name":"Gangyao Wang","affiliation":["Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management System Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Gangyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404548700"},{"name":"Meng-Chia Lee","affiliation":["Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management System Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Meng-Chia","lastName":"Lee","id":"38511219300"},{"name":"Alex Q.

The stress tests show no degradation of SBDs up to 10,000 cycles of surge current below 34.9A/mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The aluminum metallization and bipolar degradation are the main limits for the reliability of SiC diodes under surge conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of 4H-SiC SBD/JBS diodes under repetitive surge current stress","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342436","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342436.pdf","startPage":"2245","endPage":"2248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of 4H-SiC SBD/JBS diodes under repetitive surge current stress","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342436/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132744","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of 4H-SiC SBD/JBS diodes under repetitive surge current stress","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3251104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064017S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342440,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Hoffmann","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37604060200"},{"name":"Markus Andresen","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Andresen","id":"38512113000"},{"name":"Friedrich W.

The new control concept is introduced in theory based on a review of the conventional FCS-MPC concepts performed with a constant sampling time. Based on the partitioning of the sampling instant in multiple smaller sampling instants it is possible to optimize, besides the switching states, the switching states turn-on times. Therefore, the proposed variable sampling time FCS-MPC sets both: the switching state and the related turn-on times. To utilize the available calculation power for longer sampling instants an adaptation of the control- and prediction horizon to the sampling time is proposed. The theoretical control concepts are applied to the control of a grid connected two-level voltage-source converter where a simple L-type line-filter is used to demonstrate the control performance of the variable sampling time FCS-MPC algorithms in the laboratory environment.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342440","startPage":"2215","endPage":"2222","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342440.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable sampling time finite control-set model predictive current control for voltage source inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Variable sampling time finite control-set model predictive current control for voltage source inverters","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342440/","accessionNumber":"13132748","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342440/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable sampling time finite control-set model predictive current control for voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3211315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099574S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342442,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Lindenm\u00fcller","affiliation":["Power Electronics Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Lindenm\u00fcller","id":"38016041600"},{"name":"Rodrigo Alvarez","affiliation":["Power Electronics Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Alvarez","id":"37410729000"},{"name":"Steffen Bernet","affiliation":["Power Electronics Lab, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Bernet","id":"37266741100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342442","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342442","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Magnetic resonance","Magnetic resonance imaging","Topology","Switching frequency","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","optimisation","power transformers","resonant power convertors","switching convertors","traction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traction applications","series resonant DC/DC converter","optimization","power electronics","medium frequency topology","power electronic transformer","mechanic vibrations","auditory sensing threshold","switching frequency","frequency 8 kHz"]}],"abstract":"To reduce weight and increase the efficiency in traction applications several power electronics based solutions have been proposed.

This paper introduces a transformer-less medium-voltage motor drive system consisting of two 5L-ANPC converters connected back-to-back (BTB). Both the rectifier and inverter are based on phase-disposition (PD) sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). A multi-objective optimization PWM control method based on zero-sequence voltage injection is presented in this paper. The neutral-point (NP) potential can be balanced by injecting proper zero-sequence voltages. In addition, by further limiting the region of the injected zero-sequence voltages, the series connected IGBTs can operate at fundamental frequency and the amplitude of common-mode voltage can be reduced to a quarter of the DC-link voltage. Experimental results are presented to verify the validity of this method.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342492","startPage":"3514","endPage":"3519","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342492.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization PWM control for a back-to-back five-level ANPC converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342492/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization PWM control for a back-to-back five-level ANPC converter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342492/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13132800","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization PWM control for a back-to-back five-level ANPC converter","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5021432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094516S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6342493,"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Kawamura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wataru","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"38495708900"},{"name":"Hirofumi Akagi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Akagi","id":"37271018200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342493","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":966},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Equations","Motor drives","Capacitors","Current control","AC motors","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","bridge circuits","matrix convertors","motor drives","regenerative braking","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel cascade converter","triple star bridge cells","MMCC-TSBC","medium voltage motor drive","direct ac-to-ac power converter","bidirectional power flow","regenerative braking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ac-to-ac power conversion","motor drives","multilevel converters","regenerative braking"]}],"abstract":"The paper describes a new family member of the modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC), with the given name, triple-star bridge-cells (TSBC).

A discrete-time mathematical model of an MMC is derived and a predictive model is developed. The salient feature of the proposed control strategy is that it enables precise ac-side current control, capacitor voltage balancing, and circulating current mitigation of an MMC, simultaneously, with a simple implementation procedure. Performance of the proposed MPC-based strategy for a five-level grid-connected MMC unit is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate satisfactory response of the system operating based on the proposed MPC strategy, under various conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342494.pdf","startPage":"3500","endPage":"3505","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive control of a three-phase DC-AC Modular Multilevel Converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Switches","Voltage control","Current control","Mathematical model","Cost function","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","electric current control","power grids","predictive control","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive control","three-phase DC-AC modular multilevel converter topology","voltage-power application","MPC strategy","voltage balancing task","discrete-time mathematical model","AC-side current control","circulating current mitigation","PSCAD-EMTDC software environment","time-domain simulation","five-level grid-connected MMC unit","reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Predictive control of a three-phase DC-AC Modular Multilevel Converter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342494/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132802","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive control of a three-phase DC-AC Modular Multilevel Converter","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"5001071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063819S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342503,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Uchida","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Uchida","id":"38022333800"},{"name":"Tomoki Yokoyama","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37275594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342503","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Pulse width modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital control","Inverters","Hardware","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","discrete time systems","field programmable gate arrays","PWM invertors","sampling methods","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable multisampling digital control","PWM Inverter","FPGA based hardware controller","data sampling feedback","power electronics","discrete time model","multirate deadbeat control method","transient response","frequency 1 MHz"]}],"abstract":"FPGA technologies realize very fast digital calculation capability with 1MHz order data sampling feedback in power electronics field.

eccentricity for induction motors is important for guaranteeing motor reliability, since eccentricity can eventually lead to motor failure due to stator rotor contact. However, there are many limitations to applying existing test methods such as motor current signature analysis (MCSA) in the field, especially for variable frequency applications. In this paper, a new inverter-embedded test approach for detecting eccentricity for induction motors is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to perform a standstill test whenever the motor is stopped, to extract information on motor eccentricity. The motor is excited with a low frequency pulsating ac field superimposed on different levels of dc fields, and the variation in the differential inductance pattern due to the change in the degree of magnetic saturation caused by eccentricity is observed. An experimental study on a 7.5 Hp induction motor under controlled eccentricity conditions verifies that the sensitivity of eccentricity detection can be significantly improved compared to existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342518","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342518.pdf","startPage":"3000","endPage":"3007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverter-fed induction motors based on the differential inductance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342518/","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverter-fed induction motors based on the differential inductance","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342518/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132825","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverter-fed induction motors based on the differential inductance","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"4321306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095664S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342520,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Anthony","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Management Group (EEMG), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Anthony","id":"38232104500"},{"name":"Neville McNeill","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Management Group (EEMG), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Neville","lastName":"McNeill","id":"37282096800"},{"name":"Derrick Holliday","affiliation":["Institute for Energy and Environment, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Derrick","lastName":"Holliday","id":"37272774400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342520","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":786},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","MOSFETs","Silicon carbide","Voltage measurement","Inductance","Switches","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","power MOSFET","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed resonant gate driver","controlled peak gate voltage","silicon carbide MOSFET","parasitic inductance","gate path","switching speeds","high switching losses","damping resistance","gate resistor","feedback loop","conventional gate drive methods","voltage 1200 V","SiC"]}],"abstract":"Parasitic inductance in the gate path of a Silicon Carbide MOSFET places an upper limit upon the switching speeds achievable from these devices, resulting in unnecessarily high switching losses due to the introduction of damping resistance into the gate path.

Recently, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) drives have achieved prominence in wind energy conversion systems (WECS), due to their reliability and availability. Therefore, in this paper a new approach is proposed for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for WECS. As opposed to the conventional state observer-based methods for current sensor faults, which require a system model and the respective parameters, the proposed diagnostic method uses the measured phase currents only. Thus, its main merits are simplicity and reliability in the diagnosis, making it suitable for real-time implementation and to trigger remedial procedures. Additionally, current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished and the affected phase is effectively identified in both cases. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to the two power converters of a conventional back-to-back topology, and its performance is analyzed by means of several experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2090","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342555.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Current measurement","Fault detection","Fault tolerant systems","Control systems","Fault tolerance","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct energy conversion","fault tolerance","observers","permanent magnet generators","power convertors","synchronous generators","synchronous motor drives","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current sensor fault diagnosis","PMSG drives","wind energy conversion systems","WECS","fault tolerant systems","fault isolation","system reconfiguration","permanent magnet synchronous generator drives","state observer-based methods","phase currents","realtime implementation","remedial procedures","open-circuit faults","power converters","back-to-back topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new approach for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for wind energy conversion systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132862","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342555/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342555/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for wind energy conversion systems","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"3031035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.182935S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6342564,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["FREEDM System Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37594536400"},{"name":"Kai Tan","affiliation":["FREEDM System Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tan","id":"38509501400"},{"name":"Alex Q.

Other applications include large scale grid connected solar and wind farm at MVDC level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast acting DC solid state fault isolation device (FID) with Si and SiC devices for MVDC distribution system","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342566","startPage":"2005","endPage":"2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342566.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A fast acting DC solid state fault isolation device (FID) with Si and SiC devices for MVDC distribution system","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342566/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132873","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast acting DC solid state fault isolation device (FID) with Si and SiC devices for MVDC distribution system","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"2921648.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055015S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342590,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyang Chen","affiliation":["Automotive & Power Group ON Semiconductor, Phoenix AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086149168"},{"name":"Isauro Amaro","affiliation":["Automotive & Power Group ON Semiconductor, Phoenix AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Isauro","lastName":"Amaro","id":"37086660783"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342590","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Damping","Logic gates","MOSFET circuits","Inductance","Equations","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","MOSFET","optimisation","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low side gate resistance","damping phase node ringing","low side MOSFET","high efficiency synchronous buck converter","parasitic capacitances","parasitic inductances","optimization equation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342590","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342590.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing low side gate resistance for damping phase node ringing of synchronous buck converter","abstract":"This paper presents a method to optimize gate resistance of low side MOSFET in terms of damping phase node ringing for high efficiency synchronous buck converter.

A description of the algorithm to implement the modulation strategy is also presented. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is its simplicity.

neutral point clamped converter","abstract":"In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is introduced to control the internal voltages of an active neutral-point clamped five-level converter (ANPC-5L). The proposed control scheme aims to keep the neutral point and phase capacitors voltages of the converter within given hysteresis bounds while at the same time minimizing the switching frequency. An additional benefit of the controlled voltages is a reduced level of output current distortion. The large number of redundant states that exist in multi-level converters makes it possible for all the objectives to be achieved. A short horizon is employed in order to ensure a manageable level of complexity. At the same time extrapolation is used to bring the performance to the desired level. Simulation results that substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342611/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132918","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive control of the internal voltages of a five-level active neutral point clamped converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive control of the internal voltages of a five-level active neutral point clamped converter","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"2471834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063835S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342614,"authors":[{"name":"Xuehua Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xuehua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601044900"},{"name":"Xinbo Ruan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xinbo","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37272848800"},{"name":"Chenlei Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chenlei","lastName":"Bao","id":"38510659100"},{"name":"Donghua Pan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Donghua","lastName":"Pan","id":"38019968500"},{"name":"Lin Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088550639"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342614","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1086},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342614","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Regulators","Damping","Steady-state","Pulse width modulation","Capacitors","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","electric current control","feedback","frequency response","invertors","PI control","power capacitors","power filters","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor current feedback coefficient","grid connected inverter","LCL filter","discrete time domain","switching frequency harmonics","frequency response","active damping","one-timestep delay","digital signal processor","PI based current regulator","Jury stability criterion","steady state error","phase margin","power 6 kW"]}],"abstract":"The LCL filter is widely used in grid-connected inverter due to its powerful ability of attenuating the switching-frequency harmonics. However, the frequency response of the LCL filter has a resonance peak, which would amplify the harmonics around the resonant frequency or even cause the inverter to be unstable. Active damping based on the feedback of capacitor current is an effective solution to damp the resonance oscillation. Since the one-timestep delay of the digital signal processor (DSP) can hardly be avoided, the stable margin of the inverter will be weakened. Besides, the optional range of the capacitor-current feedback coefficient will be shrunk. This paper discusses the effect of the one-timestep delay firstly, and proposes a step-by-step design method to choose the parameters of the PI-based current regulator and the capacitor-current feedback coefficient. Based on Jury stability criterion, the selectable 3D region surrounded by the parameters of PI-based regulator and capacitor-current feedback coefficient can be plotted. Further, some specific constraints such as steady-state error and phase margin etc. will decide the suitable values of PI regulator and capacitor-current feedback coefficient. A 6-kW single-phase grid-connected inverter is built to verify the proposed design method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342614","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342614.pdf","startPage":"1657","endPage":"1662","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of the PI regulator and feedback coefficient of capacitor current for grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter in discrete-time domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design of the PI regulator and feedback coefficient of capacitor current for grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter in discrete-time domain","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342614/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132921","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of the PI regulator and feedback coefficient of capacitor current for grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter in discrete-time domain","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"2441703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062792S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342622,"authors":[{"name":"Brian MacCleery","affiliation":["National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"MacCleery","id":"37550730700"},{"name":"Olivier Trescases","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Trescases","id":"37284084400"},{"name":"Muris Mujagic","affiliation":["National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Muris","lastName":"Mujagic","id":"37829903000"},{"name":"Damon M.

A pseudo real Laplacian concept is proposed to deal with the delicate real part operation that appears in the phasor circuits of inverters or rectifiers, where conventional LT cannot be applied.

The model is extended to the multi-sampled implementation. The proposed model considers the dynamic nonlinearity caused by the feedback of sideband frequency components of virtual inductor current, so that it is more precise than conventional Z-domain model based on averaging modeling concept and discretization.

The vehicular power systems are usually loaded with tightly regulated power electronic converters which tend to draw constant power. Since the constant power loads (CPLs) impose negative incremental resistance characteristics on the feeder system, they pose a potential threat to the stability of vehicular power systems. This effect becomes more significant in the presence of distribution lines between source and load in large vehicular power systems such as electric ships and more electric aircrafts. System transients such as sudden drop of converter side loads or increase of constant power requirement can cause complete system instability. Most of the existing research work focuses on the modeling and stabilization of DC vehicular power systems with CPLs. Only a few solutions are proposed to stabilize AC vehicular power systems with non-negligible distribution lines and CPLs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel loop cancellation technique to eliminate constant power instability in AC vehicular power systems with a theoretically unbounded system stability region. Analysis is carried out on system stability with the proposed method and simulation results are presented to validate its effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342683/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132984","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A loop cancellation based active damping solution for constant power instability in vehicular power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A loop cancellation based active damping solution for constant power instability in vehicular power systems","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"1751668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053637S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342684,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Online identification of the grid impedance is required for assessing in real-time the stability of the interconnected system formed by the grid-connected inverter and the ac grid. In this paper, a non-parametric estimation of the grid impedance is acquired on a cycle-to-cycle basis by injecting a current impulse from the grid-connected inverter and performing an online DFT analysis of the impulse response. The impulse response is decomposed into its positive- and negative-sequence components to fully characterize the impedance of balanced three-phase grids. The paper discusses as well some of the design considerations of the injected impulse, the online DFT implementation, and the sequence component decomposition. Experimental results are presented to compare the online identification against offline analysis methods, as well as grid impedance measurements based on frequency response analyzer readings.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342721.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"921","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online grid impedance identification for adaptive control of grid-connected inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Impedance","Inverters","Digital signal processing","Arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","discrete Fourier transforms","electric impedance measurement","frequency response","identification","interconnected systems","invertors","power grids","stability","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online grid impedance identification","adaptive control","grid-connected inverters","ancillary function","DSP","stability","interconnected system","ac grid","nonparametric estimation","current impulse","DFT analysis","impulse response","negative-sequence components","positive-sequence components","balanced three-phase grids","sequence component decomposition","offline analysis methods","grid impedance measurements","frequency response analyzer readings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["grid impedance identification","DFT in DSP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Online grid impedance identification for adaptive control of grid-connected inverters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342721/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13133021","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online grid impedance identification for adaptive control of grid-connected inverters","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"1342140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055923S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342725,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"},{"name":"Han-Sang Song","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Han-Sang","lastName":"Song","id":"38231474000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342725","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"abstract":"This paper deals with optimum design criteria to minimize the torque ripple of a concentrated winding Synchronous Reluctance Motor (CW-SynRM) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM).

This paper describes an approach for overcoming this obstacle using a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment that harnesses the parallel processing capabilities of large numbers of computers to evaluate many candidate designs simultaneously. Differential evolution has been selected as the optimization algorithm that applies FE analysis to maximize the electromagnetic performance according to an objective function in a computationally-efficient manner. This software has been applied using available HTC resources to optimize the design of a 30 kW (continuous) fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW) surface permanent magnet (SPM) machine for high torque density. Tests comparing the computational speeds achieved using the same optimization software with the HTC resources and a single computer have demonstrated a major reduction (approx. 30:1) of the computation time using the HTC approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342727/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13133027","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342727/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Machine design optimization based on finite element analysis in a high-throughput computing environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine design optimization based on finite element analysis in a high-throughput computing environment","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"1281392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045549S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6342732,"authors":[{"name":"Rajib Mikail","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Rajib","lastName":"Mikail","id":"37298769500"},{"name":"Iqbal Husain","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Iqbal","lastName":"Husain","id":"37278148300"},{"name":"Yilmaz Sozer","affiliation":["University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Yilmaz","lastName":"Sozer","id":"37373747000"},{"name":"Mohammad Islam","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Islam","id":"38636249500"},{"name":"Tomy Sebastian","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Tomy","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37266880900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342732","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":349},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-quadrant torque ripple minimization of switched reluctance machine through current profiling with mitigation of rotor eccentricity problem and sensor errors","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342732.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"842","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Rotors","Reluctance machines","Harmonic analysis","Vehicle dynamics","Minimization","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","machine theory","mass production","reluctance machines","rotors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four quadrant torque ripple minimization","switched reluctance machine","electric current profiling","rotor eccentricity problem mitigation","quadrant current profiling","finite element based machine model","dynamic controller model","position sensor error","manufacturing build variation","mass production"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342732","abstract":"The paper presents a method of profiling the phase currents to minimize the torque ripple of switched reluctance machines (SRM) operating in four quadrant mode over the entire speed range of operation.

MVDC bus voltage stability can be impaired due to the presence of high-bandwidth controlled Constant Power Load (CPL) converters, which can induce negative incremental resistance instabilities. A linearization via state-feedback control is presented in this paper, to stabilize a MVDC bus voltage in presence of destabilizing CPLs. Once a linear control system is obtained, a traditional stable pole placement is operated. The control is designed to be implemented using the controlled DC/DC converters that interface the system power sources to the MVDC bus.

The uses of power semiconductor devices to overcome some of their limitations are discussed in this paper. These usages are in terms of solid-state circuit breaker (SCB) and hybrid circuit breaker (HCB) concepts.

Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping reduces the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. However, the frequency responses of the current regulator and active damping interact with each other, making it difficult to design the proper controller parameters and investigate the effect of the controller parameters. Taking proportional-integral (PI) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping as an instance, this paper proposes a step-by-step design method of the current regulator and capacitor current feedback coefficient in both analog control and digital control. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the satisfactory regions of the controller parameters are obtained based on stability margin and steady-state error checking, making it more convenient and explicit to optimize the performance of the system. The convenient trial-and-error procedures are successfully reduced. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342769","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342769.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"586","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of injected grid current regulator and capacitor-current-feedback active-damping for LCL-type grid-connected inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design of injected grid current regulator and capacitor-current-feedback active-damping for LCL-type grid-connected inverter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13133069","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342769/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of injected grid current regulator and capacitor-current-feedback active-damping for LCL-type grid-connected inverter","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0861233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079435S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6342772,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Meyer","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Meyer","id":"38510024700"},{"name":"Axel Mertens","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Mertens","id":"37297781600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342772","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":877},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Resonant frequency","Harmonic analysis","Frequency modulation","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric generators","filters","network topology","power conversion harmonics","power convertors","power grids","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LCL filters design","parameter variations","grid-connected converters","switching frequency generating harmonics","voltage harmonics","filter resonance frequency","filter parameters tolerances","grid voltage","grid frequency","wind energy generator","full-scale three-level medium-voltage converter","low-voltage laboratory","grid code requirements","voltage quality","converter topologies","periodical output voltage generation","power 5 MW"]}],"abstract":"In this paper an efficient design process of LCL filters for grid-connected converters is described. It is especially developed to design filters for converters with low switching frequency generating harmonics in the entire frequency range. In these special applications, some small parameter variations can cause the given limits, like the allowed voltage harmonics, to be exceeded. In the worst case, the resonance frequency of the filter can be excited to an unacceptable extent. To avoid this, the tolerances of the filter parameters, the grid voltage and the grid frequency are taken into account when designing the filter. This essential consideration of the parameter variations distinguishes this new method from the well-known design processes. As an example, a filter design for a 5 MW wind energy generator with full-scale three-level medium-voltage converter is regarded more detailed. Measurements on a scaled low-voltage laboratory setup validate the theoretical calculations and complete the examination. The discussed design process enables a filter design meeting all grid code requirements concerning the voltage quality for all relevant operating ranges in consideration of various parameter variations. The method is suitable for all converter topologies and modulation schemes generating periodical output voltages.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342772","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342772.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of LCL filters in consideration of parameter variations for grid-connected converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of LCL filters in consideration of parameter variations for grid-connected converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342772/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13133072","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of LCL filters in consideration of parameter variations for grid-connected converters","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0831108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05075S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342773,"authors":[{"name":"Huafeng Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huafeng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37287668900"},{"name":"Xiaohui Qu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Qu","id":"37545595500"},{"name":"Shaojun Xie","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaojun","lastName":"Xie","id":"37278013400"},{"name":"Jinming Xu","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinming","lastName":"Xu","id":"38499460100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342773","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":582},"abstract":"LCL filter characterized with high harmonic current attenuating performance and low cost are suitable for medium and high power grid-connected inverters.

However, the problem of maximizing the torque capability is still controversial, since the results depend on the constraints that have been considered. The analysis presented in this paper shows how to maximize the magnetic torque under the same rms value of the stator current. Finally, two control schemes for high torque-density multiphase induction motors are illustrated. Some experimental tests confirm the validity of the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342780","startPage":"495","endPage":"502","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342780.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-torque-per-ampere control of high torque-density multiphase drives based on induction motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-torque-per-ampere control of high torque-density multiphase drives based on induction motors","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342780/","accessionNumber":"13133080","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342780/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-torque-per-ampere control of high torque-density multiphase drives based on induction motors","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0751838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073065S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342781,"authors":[{"name":"Myoungho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myoungho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37536817300"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Ki","lastName":"Sul","id":"37267508300"},{"name":"Junggi Lee","affiliation":["EV Components Research Group, LG Electronics, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junggi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406256300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342781","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Voltage measurement","Measurement uncertainty","Voltage control","Phase measurement","Measurement errors","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","electric current control","machine control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motor drives","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current measurement error compensation","phase current measurement","current-controlled PMSM drive system","torque control performance","phase current","output voltage","current controller","compensation method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342781","abstract":"Accurate measurement of phase current is crucial in a current-controlled PMSM drive system.

A phase disposition pulse width modulation technique with minimum switching counts is implemented for the proposed topology.

portable electronics. Fully integrated variable sampling slope (VSS) technique can provide precise phase regulation under variable line voltage. Besides, the no-deadtime ramp generator (NDRG) records the previous status to modify the sequent on-time value to achieve current sharing for suppressing the total harmonic distortion (THD) and restraining the input current ripple, EMI filter, and the size of input inductor. Therefore, more power can be provided by the proposed interleaving PFC than that of single-phase PFC. Simultaneously, the drawback of the peak current twice than the average current in the Boundary control mode (BCM) can be greatly reduced. The test circuit fabricated in the TSMC 0.5\u03bcm 800V UHV process shows the highly integrated interleaving PFC can deliver high power of 180W with improved phase regulation precision.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342809","startPage":"298","endPage":"301","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342809.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable sampling slope (VSS) and no-deadtime ramp generator (NDRG) techniques for closed-loop interleaving power factor correction (PFC) design with suppression of current mismatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Variable sampling slope (VSS) and no-deadtime ramp generator (NDRG) techniques for closed-loop interleaving power factor correction (PFC) design with suppression of current mismatch","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342809/","accessionNumber":"13133109","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342809/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable sampling slope (VSS) and no-deadtime ramp generator (NDRG) techniques for closed-loop interleaving power factor correction (PFC) design with suppression of current mismatch","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0421557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120364S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6342811,"authors":[{"name":"Adeel Zaheer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Adeel","lastName":"Zaheer","id":"38235182500"},{"name":"Dariusz Kacprzak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kacprzak","id":"37443877000"},{"name":"Grant A.

The magnetic design of the receiver/secondary and transmitter/primary pads is the most critical part of an IPT system design. This paper presents the performance of a Bipolar Pad (BPP) receiver in a lumped IPT system for EV charging systems and compares it against the performance of a recently proposed receiver design, Double-D Quadrature Pad (DDQP). A 3D finite element modeling tool, which has shown good agreement between measured and simulated results in the past, is used to simulate all the models presented in this paper. The prototype models are also built and tested to verify the simulated results. Although it has been shown that the polarized single sided flux pad design, Double-D Pad (DDP), has much better performance than the non-polarized single sided flux pad design, Circular Pad (CP), still the ability of a receiver pickup to interoperate with both types of transmitters is considered to be highly desirable. In this paper the performance of a BPP receiver is compared against the performance of a DDQP receiver when used with either a DDP transmitter or a CP transmitter. The results show that the BPP receiver approximately matches the output levels provided by a DDQP receiver while using less amount of copper. Finally, the possibility of improving the ability of both the BPP and DDQP receivers to interoperate with both DDP and CP transmitters by changing the receiver ferrite structure is investigated. The results however indicate that for both the BPP and the DDQP receiver designs, the traditional ferrite structure exhibits best material usage efficiency amongst the design possibilities considered in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342811","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","startPage":"283","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bipolar receiver pad in a lumped IPT system for electric vehicle charging applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar receiver pad in a lumped IPT system for electric vehicle charging applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342811/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13133111","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6342811/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar receiver pad in a lumped IPT system for electric vehicle charging applications","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0401439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062959S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6342813,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroya Takanashi","affiliation":["Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroya","lastName":"Takanashi","id":"38512438600"},{"name":"Yukiya Sato","affiliation":["Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukiya","lastName":"Sato","id":"38505484000"},{"name":"Yasuyoshi Kaneko","affiliation":["Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyoshi","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37357513700"},{"name":"Shigeru Abe","affiliation":["Saitama University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Abe","id":"37395872200"},{"name":"Tomio Yasuda","affiliation":["Technova, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomio","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"37544980400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0803-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0802-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0800-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0801-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"6342813","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":2332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Windings","Capacitors","Couplings","Wireless communication","Equations","Equivalent circuits","Transformer cores"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","electric vehicles","machine insulation","power transformers","radiofrequency power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large air gap wireless power transfer system","electric vehicles","lateral direction","transformer","H-shaped core capacitors","split primary capacitors","coupling factor","size 200 mm","power 3 kW","core loss","winding"]}],"abstract":"A wireless power transfer system for electric vehicles is required to have high efficiency, a large air gap, and good tolerance for misalignment in the lateral direction and to be compact and lightweight.

Conductive charger regulation of vehicle regenerative energy storage system (RESS), or battery pack charge rate is controlled by the dedicated on-board-charger (OBC) in coordination with the vehicles battery management system (BMS). Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) charging of PEV's is a relatively new and emerging technology that will not benefit from standardization work until 2014 or later. As such, various approaches are currently underway to manage the power flow from the grid-tied high frequency power inverter to the vehicle RESS. WPT regulation approaches can be secondary side only, primary side only or a combination of both. In this paper Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) envisions a system that is fast charge compatible and that minimizes the vehicle on board complexity by placing the burden of power regulation on the grid side converter.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a control method of inverter-interfaced Distributed Generation (DG) units, which can autonomously share harmonic currents and resonance damping burdens. The approach employs a load compensator based on the decomposition of output current, in addition to the outer droop-based power controller, as well as inner voltage and current controllers. The load compensator consists of a virtual fundamental impedance loop for enhanced sharing of reactive power, and a variable harmonic impedance loop which allows to counteract harmonic voltage drops across the grid-side inductance of the DG inverter, and to damp the harmonic resonance propagation throughout a distribution feeder. Experiments on a three-phase microgrid are performed to validate the performance of the proposed control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition

control strategy referred to as model predictive pulse pattern control (MP\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nC) is adapted to the ACS 2000 five-level power converter of ABB. The drive consists of an induction machine and a five-level active neutral-point clamped (ANPC-5L) inverter. The power inverter is fed with optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) that produce minimum harmonic distortion in the stator winding of the ac machine. An optimal stator flux trajectory is calculated from these OPPs and a trajectory controller tracks it in real-time. In the proposed approach, trajectory tracking is based on model predictive control (MPC): a constrained optimal control problem is formulated and solved in real-time in a time-efficient manner. An event-based prediction horizon is employed in order to ensure fast tracking of the stator flux trajectory. The advantages of the proposed method are optimal steady-state behavior in terms of harmonic distortion and fast torque response. The method was tested on a pilot ACS 2000 power converter coupled to a general-purpose 1.21-MW induction machine. Experimental results were obtained from this industrial setup; they are presented in this paper to demonstrate the high performance of MP\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nC.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342832","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331795/6342155/06342832.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive pulse pattern control for the five-level active neutral point clamped inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342832/","displayDocTitle":"Model predictive pulse pattern control for the five-level active neutral point clamped inverter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13133132","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342832/","conferenceDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model predictive pulse pattern control for the five-level active neutral point clamped inverter","confLoc":"Raleigh, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"0191797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084519S","chronDate":"15-20 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331795","isNumber":"6342155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331795","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6342155","articleId":"6342832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342885,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In a gyroscope which is symmetrical and has no defect, there would be no bias; technological defects should be investigated in order to identify and quantify bias sources, which arise from quadrature and in-phase errors. Technological dispersions within the etching step of the mechanical structure are a major source of errors.

In this paper, active feedback is explored as a means to relax such requirements by providing channel selectivity as early as possible in the receiver chain. The proposed receiver architecture addresses some of the most common problems of integrated RF filters, while maintaining their inherent tunability. Through a simplified and intuitive analysis, the operation of the receiver is examined and the design parameters affecting the filter characteristics, such as bandwidth and stopband rejection, are determined. A systematic procedure for analyzing the linearity of the receiver reveals the possibility of LNA distortion canceling, which decouples the trade-off between noise, linearity and harmonic radiation.

A multi-agent system is composed of many agents interconnected by a communication network. This paper aims to further investigate the flocking and preserving connectedness in multi-agent nonholonomic systems with proximity graphs, in which the positions and the relative distances are not available to the distributed controllers. Several sufficient conditions are derived to resolve the above problem based on the kinematic model and the dynamic model, respectively. These sufficient conditions indicate that, for any given distinct initial positions and connected initial graph, there always exist gains of the linear protocols to preserve the connectedness of the graph and realize flocking. Moreover, under an additional condition on initial heading angles, the similar result is obtained for a nonlinear protocol with the form of Kuramoto model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to validate the above theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6403532/06342895.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6403532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flocking of Multi-Agent Non-Holonomic Systems With Proximity Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342895/","displayDocTitle":"Flocking of Multi-Agent Non-Holonomic Systems With Proximity Graphs","volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13196201","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342895/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flocking of Multi-Agent Non-Holonomic Systems With Proximity Graphs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhu-2215715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176481S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6403532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6403532","articleId":"6342895","onlineDate":"16 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6342906,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

We review existing methods and present new techniques to address this problem. We address a common problem with the well-known heatmap visualization, since the often arbitrary ordering of rows and columns renders the heatmap unclear, by using spectral seriation to rearrange the solutions and objectives and thus enhance the clarity of the heatmap. A multiobjective evolutionary optimizer is used to further enhance the simultaneous visualization of solutions in objective and parameter space. Two methods for visualizing multiobjective solutions in the plane are introduced. First, we use RadViz and exploit interpretations of barycentric coordinates for convex polygons and simplices to map a mutually nondominating set to the interior of a regular convex polygon in the plane, providing an intuitive representation of the solutions and objectives. Second, we introduce a new measure of the similarity of solutions - the dominance distance - which captures the order relations between solutions. This metric provides an embedding in Euclidean space, which is shown to yield coherent visualizations in two dimensions. The methods are illustrated on standard test problems and data from a benchmark many-objective problem.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2012.2225064","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6488748/06342906.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2012.2225064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6488748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualizing Mutually Nondominating Solution Sets in Many-Objective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","displayDocTitle":"Visualizing Mutually Nondominating Solution Sets in Many-Objective Optimization","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13398087","publicationDate":"April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualizing Mutually Nondominating Solution Sets in Many-Objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-walker-2225064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053021S","chronDate":"April  2013","isNumber":"6488748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"75","articleId":"6342906","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":6342907,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6521412/6342907/6342907-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shyi-Ming Chen (M\u201988\u2013SM\u201996\u2013F\u201911) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in June 1991.","He is currently a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei.

Therefore, the design and implementation of a printed circuit board (PCB)-integrated flyback transformer for a 1-mm-thin single-phase power factor correction rectifier is under investigation. In this paper, first an overview on several integration methods is given. It is shown that the PCB integration of magnetic cores allows us to achieve the required thickness of 1 mm and a high energy density. In a next step, the design and the realization of ultra-flat magnetic components with PCB-integrated cores are discussed in detail. The presented multi-objective design procedure determines the inductor and/or transformer setup optimal with respect to minimal losses and/or minimal footprint area; for this purpose, all required electrical, magnetic, and geometrical parameters of the magnetic component are considered in the design process. Furthermore, all specific implications entailed by the PCB-integrated core, e.g., the core setup, anisotropic core losses, the interleaving of windings, or an accurate reluctance model are treated. Finally, experimental results are used to verify the design procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13191086","htmlLink":"/document/6342916/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of Ultraflat Magnetic Components With PCB-Integrated Core","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of Ultraflat Magnetic Components With PCB-Integrated Core","sourcePdf":"tpel-marxgut-2226917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107591S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6392980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6392980","articleId":"6342916","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6342926,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6515342/6342926/6342926-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shyi-Ming Chen (M'88\u2013SM'96\u2013F'11) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1991.","He is currently a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, NTUST.

Interactive or assist-as-needed (AAN) gait training encourages patient voluntary participation in the robotic gait training process which may aid in rapid motor function recovery. In this paper, a lightweight robotic gait training orthosis with two actuated and four passive degrees of freedom (DOFs) is proposed. The actuated DOFs were powered by pneumatic muscle actuators. An AAN gait training paradigm based on adaptive impedance control was developed to provide interactive robotic gait training. The proposed adaptive impedance control scheme adapts the robotic assistance according to the disability level and voluntary participation of human subjects. The robotic orthosis was operated in two gait training modes, namely, inactive mode and active mode, to evaluate the performance of the proposed control scheme. The adaptive impedance control scheme was evaluated on ten neurologically intact subjects. The experimental results demonstrate that an increase in voluntary participation of human subjects resulted in a decrease of the robotic assistance and vice versa. Further clinical evaluations with neurologically impaired subjects are required to establish the therapeutic efficacy of the adaptive-impedance-control-based AAN gait training strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2222374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6221036/6515342/06342927.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2222374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6515342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Impedance Control of a Robotic Orthosis for Gait Rehabilitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Impedance Control of a Robotic Orthosis for Gait Rehabilitation","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6342927/","accessionNumber":"13487116","pubMedId":"23193241","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Impedance Control of a Robotic Orthosis for Gait Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-hussain-2222374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086831S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6515342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6515342","articleId":"6342927","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6342931,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Hwan Park","affiliation":["Center forWireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6461155/6342931/6342931-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seok-Hwan Park received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively.","From February 2011 to January 2012, he was a Research Engineer with the Agency for Defense Development, Daejeon, Korea.

Since the signals received at different BSs are correlated, distributed source coding strategies are potentially beneficial. However, they require each BS to have information about the joint statistics of the received signals across the BSs, and they are generally sensitive to uncertainties regarding such information. Motivated by this observation, a robust compression method is proposed to cope with uncertainties on the correlation of the received signals. The problem is formulated using a deterministic worst case approach, and an algorithm is proposed that achieves a stationary point for the problem. Then, BS selection is addressed with the aim of reducing the number of active BSs, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of the network. An optimization problem is formulated in which compression and BS selection are performed jointly by introducing a sparsity-inducing term into the objective function. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is shown to converge to a locally optimal point. From numerical results, it is observed that the proposed robust compression scheme compensates for a large fraction of the performance loss induced by the imperfect statistical information. Moreover, the proposed BS selection algorithm is seen to perform close to the more complex exhaustive search solution.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2226945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6461155/06342931.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6461155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2226945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Efficient Distributed Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust and Efficient Distributed Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342931/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13307182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6342931/","volume":"62","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and Efficient Distributed Compression for Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-park-2226945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140693S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6461155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6461155","articleId":"6342931","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6342942,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Lingjie","lastName":"Duan"},{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6342942","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1826},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Relays","Receivers","Resource management","Transmitters","Protocols","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cooperative communication","game theory","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sharing","contract-based approach","economic incentives","dynamic spectrum access","secondary users relay traffics","primary users","dedicated spectrum access time","PU-SU interaction","labor market","contract theory","relaying power","optimal contract design","strongly incomplete information scenarios","weakly incomplete information scenarios","decompose-and-compare approximate algorithm","close-to-optimal contract","average utility loss","suboptimal DC algorithm","game theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["game theory","Dynamic spectrum access","spectrum trading","cooperative spectrum sharing","contract theory"]}],"abstract":"Providing economic incentives to all parties involved is essential for the success of dynamic spectrum access. Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve this, where secondary users (SUs) relay traffics for primary users (PUs) in exchange for dedicated spectrum access time for SUs' own communications. In this paper, we study the cooperative spectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' wireless characteristics are private information and not known by a PU. We model the PU-SU interaction as a labor market using contract theory. In contract theory, the employer generally does not completely know employees' private information before the employment and needs to offers employees a contract under incomplete information. In our problem, the PU and SUs are, respectively, the employer and employees, and the contract consists of a set of items representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i.e., reward) and relaying power (i.e., contribution). We study the optimal contract design for both weakly and strongly incomplete information scenarios. In the weakly incomplete information scenario, we show that the PU will optimally hire the most efficient SUs and the PU achieves the same maximum utility as in the complete information benchmark. In the strongly incomplete information scenario, however, the PU may conservatively hire less efficient SUs as well. We further propose a decompose-and-compare (DC) approximate algorithm that achieves a close-to-optimal contract. We further show that the PU's average utility loss due to the suboptimal DC algorithm and the strongly incomplete information are relatively small (less than 2 and 1.3 percent, respectively, in our numerical results with two SU types).","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2012.231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6674931/06342942.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2012.231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sharing: A Contract-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6342942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sharing: A Contract-Based Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6342942/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13934406","volume":"13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sharing: A Contract-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"ttm2014010174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198884S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"6674931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"115","articleId":"6342942","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6343022,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Bauer","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Bauer","id":"38467131500"},{"name":"Jorge D\u00e1vila-Chac\u00f3n","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"D\u00e1vila-Chac\u00f3n","id":"38510170000"},{"name":"Erik Strahl","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Strahl","id":"38505344100"},{"name":"Stefan Wermter","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wermter","id":"37323875400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2512-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2510-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2511-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6343022","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Robot sensing systems","Complexity theory","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","sensor fusion","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual reality","sensor fusion","biomimetic robotics"]}],"abstract":"Considerable time and effort often go into designing and implementing experimental set-ups (ES) in robotics.

In this field, magnetometers have primarily been used as compasses. As such, they are seen as unreliable sensors when in presence of magnetic field disturbances, which are frequent in indoor environment. This work presents a method to account for and extract useful information from those disturbances. This method leads to improved localization in an indoor environment. Local magnetic disturbances carry enough information to localize without the help of other sensors. We describe an algorithm allowing to do so as long as we have access to a map of those disturbances. We then expose a fast mapping technique to produce such maps and we apply this technique to show the stability of the magnetic disturbances in time. Finally, the proposed localization algorithm is tested in a realistic situation, showing high-quality localization capability.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2012.6343024","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335102/6342994/06343024.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2012.6343024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-Axis magnetic field mapping and fusion for indoor localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343024/","displayDocTitle":"3-Axis magnetic field mapping and fusion for indoor localization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116604","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343024/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-Axis magnetic field mapping and fusion for indoor localization","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040732S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335102","isNumber":"6342994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335102","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6342994","articleId":"6343024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6343036,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College Hospital Medical School, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537718900"},{"name":"Juan Greco","affiliation":["ICT Information and Communication Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Greco","id":"38503263200"},{"name":"Xiaojing Song","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College Hospital Medical School, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Song","id":"37402937400"},{"name":"Joao Bimbo","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College Hospital Medical School, London, UK"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Bimbo","id":"38502461400"},{"name":"Lakmal Seneviratne","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College Hospital Medical School, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lakmal","lastName":"Seneviratne","id":"37265268500"},{"name":"Kaspar Althoefer","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College Hospital Medical School, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kaspar","lastName":"Althoefer","id":"37265264700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2512-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2510-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2511-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6343036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Shape","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dexterous manipulators","feature extraction","neurocontrollers","object recognition","robot vision","shape recognition","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile image based contact shape recognition","neural network classifier","robotic finger","tactile pressure sensing","low-resolution pressure map","feature extraction technique","feature vector","scale invariant","positioning invariant","partial occlusion invariant","contact sensory information","robotic hand gestures","robotic hand grasping","robotic hand manipulation","valuable feedback information","sensor resolution","image size"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343036","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for recognizing the shape of object which in contact with a robotic finger through the tactile pressure sensing. The developed algorithm is capable of distinguishing the contact shapes between a set of low-resolution pressure map. Within this algorithm, a novel feature extraction technique is developed which transforms a pressure map into a 512-feature vector. The extracted feature of the pressure map is invariant to scale, positioning and partial occlusion, and is independent of the sensor's resolution or image size. To recognize different contact shape from a pressure map, a neural network classifier is developed and uses the feature vector as inputs. It has proven from tests of using four different contact shapes that, the trained neural network can achieve a high success rate of over 90%. Contact sensory information plays a crucial role in robotic hand gestures. The algorithm introduced in this paper has the potential to provide valuable feedback information to automate and improve robotic hand grasping and manipulation.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2012.6343036","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335102/6342994/06343036.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2012.6343036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tactile image based contact shape recognition using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Tactile image based contact shape recognition using neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13116616","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6343036/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tactile image based contact shape recognition using neural network","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075242S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335102","isNumber":"6342994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335102","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6342994","articleId":"6343036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6343040,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"38510304700"},{"name":"Simon X.

The structure of the proposed algorithm is a hybrid fuzzy logic neural networks, and hence it benefits from the potentials of these two techniques. For modeling the mobile robot, the proposed system adopts the Braitenberg's automata models that were developed for agents. Wheels of the robot are represented by a bio-inspired neuron of a neural network, where each wheel receives different sensor inputs indicating different signals from either excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Training of the neural network weighting is automatically achieved through the fuzzy system that is developed to adjust the weighting between each synapse and neuron of the network. To assess the performance of the developed algorithm, simulation results are presented. It was shown that the proposed method can successfully navigate the robot to the target, and turn the robot at corners for given desired angles. The methodology proposed herein improves the Braitenberg navigation scheme and offers insights into using biologically inspired systems for path planning.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.2012.6343040","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335102/6342994/06343040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2012.6343040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342994","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy logic based bio-inspired system for mobile robot navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy logic based bio-inspired system for mobile robot navigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343040/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116620","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6343040/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy logic based bio-inspired system for mobile robot navigation","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08027S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335102","isNumber":"6342994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335102","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6342994","articleId":"6343040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6343227,"authors":[{"name":"Khairul Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6353354/6343227/6343227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khairul Alam (M'04) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Riverside.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh."]},"firstName":"Khairul","lastName":"Alam","id":"37299106900"},{"name":"Roger K.

These signals are amplified by the organic amplifier circuits from 10 to 150 mV.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2012.2220853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6353354/06343231.pdf","startPage":"3434","endPage":"3441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2220853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6353354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sheet-Type Flexible Organic Active Matrix Amplifier System Using Pseudo-CMOS Circuits With Floating-Gate Structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343231/","displayDocTitle":"Sheet-Type Flexible Organic Active Matrix Amplifier System Using Pseudo-CMOS Circuits With Floating-Gate Structure","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343231/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sheet-Type Flexible Organic Active Matrix Amplifier System Using Pseudo-CMOS Circuits With Floating-Gate Structure","sourcePdf":"ted-someya-2220853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179929S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6353354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6353354","articleId":"6343231","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6343239,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Bing Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China","School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6515342/6343239/6343239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Bing Hu received the B.S. degree in aviation electronic engineering from the Civil Aviation Institute of China, Tianjin, China, in 1998, the M.S. degree in automatic control engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in aeronautical and automotive engineering from Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 2005.","He is currently an Experienced Marie Curie Fellow with the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, and also with the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. His major fields of research include integrated risk governance, complex networks, artificial intelligence, and air traffic management."]},"firstName":"Xiao-Bing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37423321400"},{"name":"Ming Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6515342/6343239/6343239-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Wang received the B.S. degree in civil engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in structural engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2005 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing.

In this paper, we propose a new deterministic approach capable of fully determining the real Pareto front for those discrete problems for which it is possible to construct optimization algorithms to find the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n best solutions to each of the single-objective problems. To this end, two theoretical conditions are given to guarantee the finding of the actual Pareto front rather than its approximation. Then, a general methodology for designing a deterministic search procedure is proposed. A case study is conducted, where by following the general methodology, a ripple-spreading algorithm is designed to calculate the complete exact Pareto front for multiobjective route optimization. When compared with traditional Pareto front search methods, the obvious advantage of the proposed approach is its unique capability of finding the complete Pareto front. This is illustrated by the simulation results in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 March 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13487119","pubMedId":"23193246","htmlLink":"/document/6343239/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Calculating Complete and Exact Pareto Front for Multiobjective Optimization: A New Deterministic Approach for Discrete Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating Complete and Exact Pareto Front for Multiobjective Optimization: A New Deterministic Approach for Discrete Problems","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-hu-2223756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191594S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6515342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6515342","articleId":"6343239","onlineDate":"07 March 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6343245,"authors":[{"name":"Yonas G.

The proposed method performs two decoding phases, in-ordered and interleaved ones, simultaneously by using two SISO decoders, which is completely contrast to the conventional decoding approach that conducts one of the two phases alternatively. The two SISO decoders exchange their outputs immediately to accelerate the update of extrinsic information and in turn to reduce the overall decoding latency, increasing the throughput by almost two times. Moreover, the proposed decoding method can be applied to any turbo code specified in communication standards, because it is not necessary to modify the encoding process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified from intensive simulations conducted for 3GPP LTE-Advanced codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6343251/","accessionNumber":"13169830","displayDocTitle":"Immediate Exchange of Extrinsic Information for High-Throughput Turbo Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immediate Exchange of Extrinsic Information for High-Throughput Turbo Decoding","sourcePdf":"2048-cl1212-yoo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034539S","chronDate":"December  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6380512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"6380512","articleId":"6343251","onlineDate":"12 November 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6343254,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Hoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"38653555600"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6343254","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loading","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Transmitters","Optimization","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","delays","feedback","optimisation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel power loading","limited feedback","power allocation","discrete power levels","subchannel allocation","channel state information","Lloyd algorithm","joint optimization","stepwise mercury-waterfilling","fixed feedback budget","delay spread"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Limited feedback","parallel channels","multi-level power loading","stepwise mercury/waterfilling"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose multi-level power loading (MPL) as a discrete version of mercury/waterfilling power allocation.

To achieve the required data acquisition rate, these systems rely on parallel beamforming, i.e., a single wide-angled beam is used for transmission and several narrow parallel beams are used for reception. When applied to harmonic imaging, the demand for high-amplitude pressure wave fields, necessary to generate the harmonic components, conflicts with the use of a wide-angled beam in transmission because this results in a large spatial decay of the acoustic pressure. To enhance the amplitude of the harmonics, it is preferable to do the reverse: transmit several narrow parallel beams and use a wide-angled beam in reception. Here, this concept is investigated to determine whether it can be used for harmonic imaging. The method proposed in this paper relies on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which is used to create distinctive parallel beams in transmission. To test the proposed method, a numerical study has been performed, in which the transmit, receive, and combined beam profiles generated by a linear array have been simulated for the second-harmonic component. Compared with standard parallel beamforming, application of the proposed technique results in a gain of 12 dB for the main beam and in a reduction of the side lobes. Experimental verification in water has also been performed. Measurements obtained with a single-element emitting transducer and a hydrophone receiver confirm the possibility of exciting a practical ultrasound transducer with multiple Gaussian modulated pulses, each having a different center frequency, and the capability to generate distinguishable second-harmonic components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel transmit beamforming using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing applied to harmonic Imaging-A feasibility study","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2476","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6343258/06343270.pdf","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2012","displayDocTitle":"Parallel transmit beamforming using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing applied to harmonic Imaging-A feasibility study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6343270/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"November 2012","accessionNumber":"13101038","pubMedId":"23192807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel transmit beamforming using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing applied to harmonic Imaging-A feasibility study","sourcePdf":"t12b2439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055222S","chronDate":"November  2012","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6343258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6343258","articleId":"6343270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6343325,"authors":[{"name":"Liam Madden","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Madden","id":"37330191800"},{"name":"Ephrem Wu","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ephrem","lastName":"Wu","id":"38510983000"},{"name":"Namhoon Kim","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Namhoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38184049600"},{"name":"Bahareh Banijamali","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bahareh","lastName":"Banijamali","id":"37939076500"},{"name":"Khaldoon Abugharbieh","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Khaldoon","lastName":"Abugharbieh","id":"37868149300"},{"name":"Suresh Ramalingam","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Suresh","lastName":"Ramalingam","id":"38028306500"},{"name":"Xin Wu","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wu","id":"38509815300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1708-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1707-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1706-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1930-8876"}],"articleNumber":"6343325","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":623},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Field programmable gate arrays","Substrates","Frequency measurement","Transceivers","Analytical models","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ceramic packaging","electronic design automation","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","microassembling","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance heterogeneous integration","die stacking","heterogeneous stacked silicon interconnect","SSI FPGA","3D integration","low-temperature co-fired ceramic","LTCC package","optimal signal integrity","heterogeneous IC stack","passive silicon interposer","through-silicon vias","TSV","FPGA IC","transceiver","package substrate material","interposer resistivity","inter-die interconnects","electronic design automation industry","3D thermal-mechanical modeling","package reliability","package coplanarity","low-k dielectric material","micro-bumps","C4 attach","heterogeneous stacked-silicon","multichip device","bit rate 13.1 Gbit/s","bit rate 28 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the industry's first heterogeneous Stacked Silicon Interconnect (SSI) FPGA family (3D integration). Each device is housed in a low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) package for optimal signal integrity. Inside the package, a heterogeneous IC stack delivers up to 2.78Tb/s transceiver bandwidth. The resulting bandwidth is approximately three times that achievable in a monolithic solution. Mounted on a passive silicon interposer with through-silicon vias (TSVs), the heterogeneous IC stack comprises FPGA ICs with 13.1-Gb/s transceivers and dedicated analog ICs with 28-Gb/s transceivers. Optimization took place concurrently on multiple facets of the design which were necessary to successfully implement the 3-D integration. In particular, this paper outlines the choices that were made in terms of package substrate material and interposer resistivity in order to optimize 28Gb/s system channel characteristics. These choices were validated through extensive electrical simulation and test chip correlation. In addition, this paper describes the design and timing verification of inter-die interconnects, an area that the electronic design automation industry had not yet fully addressed. This paper further describes 3D thermal-mechanical modeling and analysis for package reliability. The modeling was performed to address package coplanarity issues and stresses imposed by the interposer on the active dice, the low-k dielectric material, the micro-bumps and the C4 attach. The results indicate heterogeneous stacked-silicon (3D) integration is a reliable method to build very high-bandwidth multi-chip devices that exceed current monolithic capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343325","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331298/6343319/06343325.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advancing high performance heterogeneous integration through die stacking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343325/","displayDocTitle":"Advancing high performance heterogeneous integration through die stacking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13145910","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343325/","conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advancing high performance heterogeneous integration through die stacking","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"D005C1LA13419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040665S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331298","isNumber":"6343319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331298","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6343319","articleId":"6343325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6343337,"authors":[{"name":"Vita Pi-Ho Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Vita Pi-Ho","lastName":"Hu","id":"37391915700"},{"name":"Ming-Long Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Long","lastName":"Fan","id":"37392424800"},{"name":"Pin Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pin","lastName":"Su","id":"37286925700"},{"name":"Ching-Te Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering & Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Te","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37268438500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1708-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1707-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1706-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1930-8876"}],"articleNumber":"6343337","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and performance optimization of InGaAs-OI and GeOI hetero-channel SRAM cells","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331298/6343319/06343337.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343319","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343337","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","MOSFETs","Wireless sensor networks","Stability analysis","Performance evaluation","Logic gates","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","germanium","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["InGaAs-OI","GeOI hetero-channel SRAM cell","optimized threshold voltage design","intrinsic variation immunity","high-performance 4T SRAM cell","low-voltage 6T SRAM cell","read-write stability","RSNM variation","InGaAs","Ge"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343337","abstract":"InGaAs-OI and GeOI SRAM cells using optimized threshold voltage (Vt) design to enhance the intrinsic variation immunity of high-performance (super-threshold) and low-voltage (near-/sub-threshold) 6T SRAM cells are presented.

However, the broad soft transition region in the Id-Vgs characteristics, where Id increases slowly to reach saturation following the steep slope region, results in large crossover region/current in an inverter, thus degrading the Hold/Read Static Noise Margin (H/RSNM) of TFET SRAMs. The Write-ability and Write Static Noise Margin (WSNM) of TFET SRAMs are constrained by the uni-directional conduction characteristics caused by the asymmetric source-drain structure and large cross-over contention of the Write access transistor and the holding transistor. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of TFET circuit switching characteristics/performance and compare the stability/performance of several TFET SRAM cells using atomistic TCAD mixed-mode simulations. A robust 7T Driver-Less (DL) TFET SRAM cell is proposed. The proposed 7T DL TFET SRAM cell, with decoupled Read current path from cell storage node and push-pull Write action with asymmetrical raised-cell-virtual-ground Write-assist, provides significant improvement in Read/Write stability and performance.","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings

Results show uniform breakdown voltage among different structures, PDE above 50% at \u03bb = 420 nm, DCR below 50 cps at room temperature and timing response with no exponential tail and typical full-width at half-maximum of 77 ps and 120 ps for 10 \u03bcm and 30 \u03bcm active areas, respectively.

RTS characteristics are examined through novel color-coded time-lag plots and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) time-series analyses. Noise is examined at different reset conditions to provide new insights on conduction mechanisms in HRS. Higher reset voltages result in an enhanced complexity in RTS due to a larger number of active traps.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2012.6343386","publicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Proceedings of the European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331298/6343319/06343386.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Telegraph Signal noise properties of HfOx RRAM in high resistive state","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Random Telegraph Signal noise properties of HfOx RRAM in high resistive state","conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343386/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Telegraph Signal noise properties of HfOx RRAM in high resistive state","confLoc":"Bordeaux, France","sourcePdf":"D066C3LF13307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086868S","chronDate":"17-21 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331298","isNumber":"6343319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331298","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6343319","articleId":"6343386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6343387,"authors":[{"name":"E.

An image is firstly divided into blocks and each block is separately sampled in DCT domain. Different coding schemes are used to transmit the samples based on their properties. With block-based strategy, each image block can be processed and transmitted separately, which reduces a lot of latency. Besides, an efficient system optimization algorithm is proposed by jointly optimizing the power allocation scheme and the transmission parameters to search for the maximum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image.

The proposed technique uses scene jitter as a cue for classification: when recapturing planar surfaces approximately parallel to the imaging plane, any added motion due to jitter will result in approximately uniform high-frequency 2D motion fields. The inter-frame motion trajectories are retrieved with feature tracking techniques, while local and global feature motion are decoupled through a 2-level wavelet decomposition. A normalised cross-correlation matrix is then populated with the similarities between the high-frequency components of the tracked features' trajectories. The correlation distribution is then compared with trained models for classification. Experiments with original and recaptured standard datasets show the validity of the proposed technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video jitter analysis for automatic bootleg detection","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343423","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331800/6343405/06343423.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Video jitter analysis for automatic bootleg detection","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343423/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video jitter analysis for automatic bootleg detection","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054786S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331800","isNumber":"6343405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331800","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6343405","articleId":"6343423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6343425,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Moreover, after each editing step, any video object is almost always encoded in order to store it using a less amount of memory. For this reason, inferring the number of compression steps that have been applied to such a multimedia object is an important clue in order to assess its authenticity. In this paper we propose a method to recover the number of compression steps applied to a video sequence. In order to accomplish this goal, we make use of a classifier based on multiple Support Vector Machines (SVM) exploiting the Benford's law. Indeed, the feature vectors used to train and test the SVM are based on the statistics of the most significant digit of quantized transform coefficients. The proposed method is tested with a generic hybrid video encoder combining motion-compensation and block coding. Results show that this method is able to discriminate up to three compression stages with high accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343405","startPage":"112","endPage":"117","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331800/6343405/06343425.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple compression detection for video sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Support vector machines","Encoding","Video sequences","Image coding","Vectors","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","feature extraction","image sequences","motion compensation","signal classification","statistical analysis","support vector machines","transforms","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple compression detection","video sequence editing","video object encoding","multimedia object","authenticity assessment","compression step number recovery","multiple support vector machine classifier","SVM","Benford law","feature vectors","statistics","quantized transform coefficient","generic hybrid video encoder","motion compensation","block coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multiple compression detection for video sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343425/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343425/","accessionNumber":"13116316","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple compression detection for video sequences","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055865S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331800","isNumber":"6343405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331800","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6343405","articleId":"6343425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6343430,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hung Ling","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hung","lastName":"Ling","id":"37401604900"},{"name":"Chia-Wen Lin","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278408000"},{"name":"Chiou-Ting Hsu","affiliation":["Department Computer Science, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiou-Ting","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276772600"},{"name":"Hong-Yuan Mark Liao","affiliation":["Institute Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Yuan Mark","lastName":"Liao","id":"37333498900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4572-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4570-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4571-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6343430","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343430","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Humans","Manifolds","Training","Image resolution","Image reconstruction","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["examplar-based object posture superresolution","manifold learning-based approach","human motion sequence temporal resolution","motion tendency learning","low-resolution sequence","low-dimension manifold space","motion trajectory reconstruction","HR training sequences","object inpainting technique"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a learning-based approach to increase the temporal resolutions of human motion sequences. Given a set of high resolution motion sequences, our idea is first to learn the motion tendency from this learning dataset and then synthesize new postures for the low-resolution sequence according to the learned motion tendency. We summarize the proposed framework in the following steps: (1) Each motion sequence is first projected into a low-dimension manifold space, where the local distance between postures could be better preserved. We then represent each of the projected motion sequences as a motion trajectory. (2) Next, motion priors learned from the HR training sequences are used to reconstruct the motion trajectory for the input sequence.

During the pooling stage, many weighting strategies have been proposed incorporating properties of the distortion itself, various masking effects and visual attention. Recently, researchers have devoted great enthusiasm and effort to the improvement of image quality assessment using visual saliency models. In this research, it is noticed that visual saliency features of both the original image and the distorted one have impacts on the process of image quality assessment. To reduce the overlapping effects, a nonlinear additive model is proposed to integrate saliency features from the original and distorted images towards improved error weighting results. Our extensive experimental studies on four publicly available image databases (LIVE, TID2008, CSIQ and A57) indicate that the proposed improved nonlinear additive model based saliency map weighting strategy constantly leads to higher prediction accuracy for image quality assessment than traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343461","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","startPage":"313","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343405","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331800/6343405/06343461.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","Additives","Image quality","Visualization","Computational modeling","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","feature extraction","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear additive model","saliency map weighting strategy","image quality assessment","image quality metrics","local distortion","fidelity measurement","pooling stage","masking effect","visual attention","visual saliency model","distorted image","saliency feature","error weighting","image database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image quality assessment (IQA)","visual attention (VA)","saliency map","nonlinear additive model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear additive model based saliency map weighting strategy for image quality assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343461/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343461/","accessionNumber":"13116352","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear additive model based saliency map weighting strategy for image quality assessment","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044392S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331800","isNumber":"6343405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331800","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6343405","articleId":"6343461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6343722,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Cibert","affiliation":["Engineering School of Versailles University, ISTY, University of Versailles, Velizy-Villacoublay, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Cibert","id":"38500648800"},{"name":"Vincent Hugel","affiliation":["Engineering System Laboratory (LISV), University of Versailles, Velizy-Villacoublay, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Hugel","id":"37294135300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4606-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4604-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4605-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1944-9445"}],"articleNumber":"6343722","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"Taking into consideration the architecture of the human spine, we propose the construction of a module whose series could be used as a robotic spine*. This module is basically constituted by an elastic diabolo, which mimics the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc, joining two metallic setsquares - the two consecutive vertebrae. Two actuators realize the actuation of the module and are oriented parallel to the main axis of the diabolo. This simple compliant model allowed us to construct a demonstrator that will be used to measure the incidence of active and passive movements of the model. From the knowledge of these results we will design a new compliant system in place of the elastic diabolo whose characteristics will be adequate to the convenient properties of the spine that could be included in humanoid machines.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331794/6343721/06343722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired compliant spine for humanoid robot a degrees of freedom challenge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Actuators","Humans","Humanoid robots","Muscles","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","humanoid robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired compliant spine","humanoid robot","freedom challenge degrees","human spine","robotic spine","elastic diabolo","metallic set squares","consecutive vertebrae","intervertebral disc","humanoid machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired compliant spine for humanoid robot a degrees of freedom challenge","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343722/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135717","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired compliant spine for humanoid robot a degrees of freedom challenge","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"0001MoSession1T101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113357S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331794","isNumber":"6343721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331794","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6343721","articleId":"6343722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6343737,"authors":[{"name":"Ross A.

Unlike purely reactive approaches, the proposed algorithm incorporates arbitrary trajectories as generated by a motion planner running on each navigating robot as well as predicted human trajectories. Our approach, inspired by human navigation in crowded pedestrian environments, draws from the sociology literature on pedestrian interaction. We propose a simple two-phase algorithm in which agents initially cooperate to avoid each other and then initiate civil inattention, thus lessening reactivity and committing to a trajectory. This process entails a pedestrian bargain in which all agents act competently to avoid each other and, once resolution is achieved, to avoid interfering with others' planned trajectories. This approach, being human-inspired, fluidly permits navigational interaction between humans and robots. We report experimental results for the algorithm running on real robots with and without human presence and in simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343737","startPage":"94","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331794/6343721/06343737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian-inspired sampling-based multi-robot collision avoidance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian-inspired sampling-based multi-robot collision avoidance","conferenceDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343737/","accessionNumber":"13135732","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian-inspired sampling-based multi-robot collision avoidance","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"0016MoPoster1P105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060334S","chronDate":"9-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331794","isNumber":"6343721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331794","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6343721","articleId":"6343737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6343778,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Nalin","affiliation":["eServices for Life and Health unit, Hospital San Raffale, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Nalin","id":"38256468700"},{"name":"Ilaria Baroni","affiliation":["eServices for Life and Health unit, Hospital San Raffale, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Baroni","id":"38230316600"},{"name":"Ivana Kruijff-Korbayov\u00e1","affiliation":["Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Kunstliche Intelligenz GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Rheinland-Pfalz, DE"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Kruijff-Korbayov\u00e1"},{"name":"Lola Ca\u00f1amero","affiliation":["Emotion Modeling Lab, University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lola","lastName":"Ca\u00f1amero","id":"37330555800"},{"name":"Matthew Lewis","affiliation":["Emotion Modeling Lab, University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37085436568"},{"name":"Aryel Beck","affiliation":["Emotion Modeling Lab, University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Aryel","lastName":"Beck","id":"38236673200"},{"name":"Heriberto Cuay\u00e1huitl","affiliation":["Deutsches Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz GmbH, Saarb\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Heriberto","lastName":"Cuay\u00e1huitl","id":"37298872200"},{"name":"Alberto Sanna","affiliation":["eServices for Life and Health unit, Hospital San Raffale, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Sanna","id":"38469470800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4606-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4604-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4605-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1944-9445"}],"articleNumber":"6343778","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Games","Speech","Humanoid robots","Timing","Syntactics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","humanoid robots","human-robot interaction","medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["children adaptation","multisession interaction","humanoid robot","game activities","speech timing","speed-and-tone","nodding","gestures","verbal input formulation"]}],"abstract":"This work presents preliminary observations from a study of children (N=19, age 5-12) interacting in multiple sessions with a humanoid robot in a scenario involving game activities.

The proposed method employs the high resolution estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) that assists ANN to continuously update its parameters according to the varying input signal to provide more accurate and reliable estimates of harmonic amplitudes. New ESPRIT assisted online training scheme makes the neural network based harmonics estimation techniques more versatile for stationary as well as time-varying power supply signals. The performance of the proposed method is validated on the time-varying synthetic signals with radial basis function neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343934/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13169883","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6343934/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ESPRIT assisted artificial neural network for harmonics detection of time-varying signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ESPRIT assisted artificial neural network for harmonics detection of time-varying signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135187S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6343934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6343939,"authors":[{"name":"Mat Syai'in","affiliation":["Mat Syai'in is with National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan and Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic (PPNS), Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mat","lastName":"Syai'in","id":"37085478983"},{"name":"Kuo Lung Lian","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan","Mat Syai'in is with National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan and Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic (PPNS), Indonesia"],"firstName":"Kuo Lung","lastName":"Lian","id":"37541893500"},{"name":"Nien-Che Yang","affiliation":["Yuan Ze University, Taiwan","Kuo Lung Lian and Tsai-Hsiang Chen are with National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Nien-Che","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407136600"},{"name":"Tsai-Hsiang Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan","Mat Syai'in is with National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), Taipei, Taiwan and Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic (PPNS), Indonesia"],"firstName":"Tsai-Hsiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276685000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6343939","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6343939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Robustness","Particle swarm optimization","Generators","Reactive power","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","load flow","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization method","distributed generators","microgrids","passive network","distribution network","PQ bus","active distribution power flow methods","resistance-to-reactance ratio","three-phase distribution power flow","IEEE benchmark system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","PV Buses","Radial Distribution Systems","Distributed Generation","Power Flow"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6343939","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06343939.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6343939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distribution power flow using particle swarm optimization","abstract":"The proliferation of distributed generators (DGs) and the concept of microgrids have altered a distribution network from a passive network to an active one.

It was demonstrated that additional control loop can be applied for static power sources, like FACTS, HVDC or modern Wind Power Plants, to modulate their power output and successfully attenuate these oscillations. Variety of control design methods were proposed for this service. In this paper focus is given to the most popular technique based on residues. Authors demonstrate on a small 4-machine 12-bus grid that residues may not provide sufficient information for effective damping control design. Hence, it is proposed to give more attention to additional indices like transfer function zero location and interactions between mode of interest and other system dynamics. Consequently, additional rules are proposed for residue based damping control design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6343981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6343981/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13169923","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of residue based power oscillation damping control of inter-area oscillations for static power sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of residue based power oscillation damping control of inter-area oscillations for static power sources","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093224S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6343981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6344015,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Vanfretti","affiliation":["Electric Power Systems Division, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Vanfretti","id":"37399742800"},{"name":"Sebastian Bengtsson","affiliation":["Electric Power Systems Division, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37902387500"},{"name":"Vedran S.

Since the basic scheme of MIMO-OFDM system is multiple data transmission, conventional FFT processor for SISO-OFDM system is not suitable for MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed FFT processor has multi-channel structure to support multiple data path. Multi-channel structure enables to processor several FFT operation with just single processor. Also, by the mixed radix algorithm, the number of non-trivial multiplications of the FFT processor is decreased. The proposed FFT processor reduces the logic gates about 25% over a 4-channel R4MDC FFT processor. Therefore, the proposed FFT processor will contribute improvement to the low power and low complexity design of MIMO-OFDM systems, since the MIMO-OFDM FFT processor is one of the largest modules in the systems, in which the low complexity design is a very important issue.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity multi-point 4-channel FFT processor for IEEE 802.11n MIMO-OFDM WLAN system","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Green and Ubiquitous Technology","doi":"10.1109/GUT.2012.6344198","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Green and Ubiquitous Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338382/6344153/06344198.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GUT.2012.6344198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6344153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity multi-point 4-channel FFT processor for IEEE 802.11n MIMO-OFDM WLAN system","conferenceDate":"7-8 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344198/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13117765","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity multi-point 4-channel FFT processor for IEEE 802.11n MIMO-OFDM WLAN system","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p949762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063945S","chronDate":"7-8 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338382","isNumber":"6344153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338382","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6344153","articleId":"6344198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6344255,"authors":[{"name":"Herbert Rojas","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Group EMC, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Rojas","id":"38235264200"},{"name":"Camilo Cortes","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Group EMC, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Camilo","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37826538900"},{"name":"Francisco Santamaria","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility and Interference Group GCEM, Universidad Distrital FJDC, Bogota, Colombia"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Santamaria","id":"38231096000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1897-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1898-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6344255","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric fields","Filtering","Lightning","Noise","Electric variables measurement","Sea measurements","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic compatibility","Fourier transforms","lightning protection","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning electric field signal","signal denoising","fractional Fourier transform","EMC-UNC research group","Bogota","Colombia","electromagnetic environment","signal measurements","undesired signal components","electric field signatures","filtering process","fractional Fourier domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fractional Fourier transform","fractional Fourier domains","filtering","lightning","electric field","denoising"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, several activities have been carried out by EMC-UNC (research group) to measure, study and classify the parameters of lightning electric fields signals in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.

This paper shows the results of applying the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) as an alternative technique to reduce the presence of noise and also of undesired signal components within a set of electric field signatures. Basic conditions to carry out the filtering process in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFd) are presented. Afterwards, some lightning electric field temporal characteristics are analyzed by using the processed signatures. Important differences between processed and measured waveforms are observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising of lightning electric field signals using fractional Fourier transform","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","doi":"10.1109/ICLP.2012.6344255","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335258/6344200/06344255.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICLP.2012.6344255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6344200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Denoising of lightning electric field signals using fractional Fourier transform","conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344255/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116711","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising of lightning electric field signals using fractional Fourier transform","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122604S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335258","isNumber":"6344200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335258","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6344200","articleId":"6344255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6344289,"authors":[{"name":"Mary Ann Cooper","affiliation":["University of Illinois @ Chicago, River Forest, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Mary Ann","lastName":"Cooper","id":"38499865900"},{"name":"Ronald.

The first organized effort on a national scale was in 1998 when a multidisciplinary group of recognized lightning researchers and experts met at an American Meteorological Society meeting and agreed on the Lightning Safety Guidelines (LSG) which were published in a number of venues. Beginning in 2001, a Lightning Safety Awareness (LSA) campaign was initiated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with many of the LSG individuals as well as others [1.2]. This campaign, now called Lightning Safety Week (LSW), occurs the last full week of June annually. The LSW website (www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov) has become the premier lightning safety site with general information, games, puzzles, public service announcements as well as special sections for the media, teachers, boaters, and many other interests and concerns. LSW members and others have continued to be active in promoting lightning inj ury prevention, train others, and develop lightning safety themes such as 'When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!' that can be learned by any age. An interactive game using a cartoon character 'Leon, the Lightning Safety Lion' was developed to help teach lightning safety to children but is well liked by adults as well. The materials from this website are all free for download, use and modification by anyone who is interested in injury prevention and lightning safety. Collectively, the LSW team and others have made themselves available for thousands of interviews with newspapers, radio and television, worked on dozens of documentaries, as well as continuing their own research and publication. There has been a steady decrease in the lightning fatality rate over the past twenty years of work with a rate of less than O.lImillion US population in each of the last three years, in part due to the educational efforts of this group and the media's support in disseminating lightning safety information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344289/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116745","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Lightning safety campaigns - USA experience","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightning safety campaigns - USA experience","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050823S","chronDate":"2-7 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335258","isNumber":"6344200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335258","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6344200","articleId":"6344289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344295,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Otani","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Otani","id":"38503509300"},{"name":"Yuki Shiraki","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Shiraki","id":"38504359400"},{"name":"Yoshihiro Baba","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Baba","id":"37275398900"},{"name":"Naoto Nagaoka","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Nagaoka","id":"37276178300"},{"name":"Akihiro Ametani","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Ametani","id":"37276192600"},{"name":"Naoki Itamoto","affiliation":["Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Itamoto","id":"37369732400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1897-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1898-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1896-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6344295","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"abstract":"If an impulse or surge high current flows in a grounding electrode, the soil in the vicinity of the grounding electrode would be ionized and the voltage generated at the top of the grounding electrode would be reduced. Recently, Ala et al.

In the model, the resistivity of each soil-representing cell is controlled by the instantaneous value of the electric field there and time. Ala et al. have tested the validity of the model against experiments on a single vertical grounding rod having two different lengths: 0.61 m and 3.05 m, into which a simple-shape unipolar high current is injected. In this paper, the model is applied to analyzing the surge responses of four parallel vertical grounding rods of length 3.05 m and a single horizontal grounding conductor having two different lengths: 8.1 m and 34 m to a single-peak unipolar high current, and the FDTD-computed responses are compared with the corresponding ones measured by Bellaschi et al. (1942) and Sekioka et al. (1998). Furthermore, it is applied to analyzing the surge responses of a 1-m single vertical grounding rod and a 5-m single horizontal grounding conductor to a double-peak unipolar high current. The FDTD-computed responses are then compared with the corresponding ones measured by Geri et al.

SKYTREE\u00ae has recently been constructed in the eastern area of central Tokyo, located in the Kanto Plain, and is the tallest free-standing broadcasting tower in the world (634m). When a tall structure is located on a plain, it is expected that lightning will often strike the structure when thunderclouds approach. The authors plan to observe the currents of lightning striking TOKYO SKYTREE and have installed Rogowski coils on the tower at a height of 497m.

Many of these applications require the detection of three-phase signals characteristics. Generally, these techniques are implemented in DSP devices, with the execution time limited by sample rates of input signals. FPGA implementation results in several advantages. In this paper, an FPGA design flow for industrial digital signal processing is proposed. The first contribution is a metric for comparison between FPGA devices and DSP devices. This metric estimates the quality of implementations based on the efficiency of resources utilization in both technologies. A case study of a magnitude and phase angle detector of the fundamental-frequency positive-sequence component of a three-phase signal is presented. As a second contribution, a proposed FPGA-controller architecture is presented. For validation of the proposed metric, the advantages and possibilities of the use of FPGA in the case study are demonstrated in comparison with the DSP, in terms of the efficiency of resource usage metric, which is based on the capacity for increasing the application algorithms complexity and capacity of exploring the parallelism of operations, allowing for a much shorter execution time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field-flow fractionation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","phase detectors","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA design methodology","DSP industrial applications","three-phase positive-sequence detector","FPGA technology","power converters","renewable energy systems","uninterruptible power supplies","active power filters","dynamic voltage restorers","power system protection","three-phase signals characteristic detection","DSP devices","industrial digital signal processing","FPGA devices","phase angle detector","magnitude angle detector","fundamental-frequency positive-sequence component","FPGA-controller architecture","application algorithm complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Design flow","DSP","Industrial Applications","Three-Phase Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344430","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2012.6344430","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2012 25th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 25th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337025/6344418/06344430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6344418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2012.6344430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344430/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA design methodology for DSP industrial applications -

Later, instances may be evolved independently and synchronization techniques are needed to evolve the original model so that conformity is restored.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Object oriented modeling","Biological system modeling","Data models","Unified modeling language","Visualization","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","software engineering","spreadsheet programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven spreadsheets","multiuser environment","distributed collaboration","synchronization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344528","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335083/6344456/06344528.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6344456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven spreadsheets in a multi-user environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven spreadsheets in a multi-user environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344528/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344528/","accessionNumber":"13116557","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven spreadsheets in a multi-user environment","confLoc":"Innsbruck, Austria","sourcePdf":"gc09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050369S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335083","isNumber":"6344456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335083","xplore-issue":"6344456","articleId":"6344528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6344572,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37309040300"},{"name":"Andrea Goldsmith","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37269021300"},{"name":"H.

The problem is established as one of maximizing the minimum distance among the voltage phase angle signatures of the outages, which can be equivalently formulated as an integer programming problem. Based on a greedy heuristic and a linear programming relaxation, a branch and bound algorithm is proposed to find the globally optimal PMU locations. Using this algorithm, the optimal tradeoff between the number of PMUs and the outage detection performance is characterized for IEEE 14, 24 and 30 bus systems. The algorithm is shown to find the globally optimal PMU locations in a small number of iterations. It is observed that it is sufficient to have roughly one third of the buses providing PMU measurements in order to achieve the same outage detection performance as with all the buses providing PMU measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344572/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13169936","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On PMU location selection for line outage detection in wide-area transmission networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On PMU location selection for line outage detection in wide-area transmission networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077833S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344574,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Studies suggest that the large-scale PV plants can have either a positive or negative influence on power system oscillation, which depends on many factors, including their location and sizes. Given the fact that these plants cannot be located in their ideal location for placement in power system, it is important to consider designing controllers for flawless integration. In this paper, a minimax Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) based power oscillation damper (POD) for large-scale PV plant is proposed for oscillation damping. As a benchmark system for oscillatory stability analysis, the two-area test system is used to demonstrate the system performance with the designed controller. The robustness of the designed controller is verified under different operating conditions by eigenvalue analysis and non-linear power system simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller for PV plant improves the damping of inter-area mode for a wide range of operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344631","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344631.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of robust power oscillation damping controller for large-scale PV plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design of robust power oscillation damping controller for large-scale PV plant","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344631/","accessionNumber":"13169988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344631/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of robust power oscillation damping controller for large-scale PV plant","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077736S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344640,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Jalayer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Reza Jalayer received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran-Iran in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

In addition to simplicity and being less time-consuming, the ability to find the damping coefficients separately for any desired frequency makes this method a reliable technique.

The rapid development of the large scale energy storage technology, such as sodium sulfur batteries, makes it an excellent candidate in achieving the goals of the smart grid. This paper proposed a modified multi-objective particle swarm optimization approach to solve the energy storage design problem in distribution systems. A Pareto front is provided by the proposed approach for decision makers to determine the desired tradeoff between multiple objectives. Within the energy storage design variables, not only the conventionally considered energy storage capacity and power rate are included, but also the energy storage operation strategy. Three energy storage operation strategies are presented and their impacts on reliability and economy are illustrated. A case study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Insights based on the case study results are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344699","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344699.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective design of energy storage in distribution systems based on modified particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Reliability","Power system reliability","Economics","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","distribution networks","energy storage","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective design","distribution systems","smart grid","power systems","modified multiobjective particle swarm optimization approach","Pareto front","decision makers","distribution systems","energy storage capacity","power rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective design","energy storage","distribution systems","particle swarm optimization","energy storage operation strategy","reliability","cost"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective design of energy storage in distribution systems based on modified particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170052","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective design of energy storage in distribution systems based on modified particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069558S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6344704,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Machado Monaro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Renato Machado","lastName":"Monaro","id":"38093705100"},{"name":"Rog\u00e9rio Cesar Serapi\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["CPFL-Companhia Paulista de For\u00e7a e Luz, Bauru, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rog\u00e9rio Cesar Serapi\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"38507162400"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos de Melo Vieira","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Carlos","lastName":"de Melo Vieira","id":"37085426417"},{"name":"Denis Vinicius Coury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Denis Vinicius","lastName":"Coury","id":"37266599800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6344704","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344704","abstract":"This paper presents an alternative technique to detect and correct waveforms distortion due to Current Transformer (CT) saturation using intelligent tools based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Traditionally, this type of application has been developed in the field of demand management; however, the high energy consumption growth rates have taken electric firms to analyze their application on the system expansion planning, hence deferring, or even preventing, the need to invest in capacity to supply the demand during peak periods.

Based on the Weierstrass approximation theorem, a numerical method is proposed to calculate the damping torque and damping coefficient of power system described by detailed model, no matter that the post-fault system is stable or not. Investigation on the single-machine-infinite-bus system discloses the transient damping with different generator parameters relative to transient losses, load condition and modeling hypotheses. The result indicates that, for the studied system, neglecting armature resistance, or neglecting the rate of change of flux terms and rotor speed deviation in armature voltage calculation may cause the average damping coefficient approaching zero. The torque-speed characteristics and network transients have very small influence on average transient damping. The work helps to identify the main factor that affects transient behaviors and provide evidence for reasonable modeling hypothesis and model selection in transient stability assessment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344750","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344750.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping property in power system transient behaviors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Damping property in power system transient behaviors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170103","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344750/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping property in power system transient behaviors","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046602S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344755,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Wall","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6344755/6344755-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Wall graduated from the University of Manchester with a Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (2008) and with a Masters degree in Power Systems (2009).

Firstly, the measured current signals are decomposed using the wavelet transform to obtain the necessary frequency details and then the spectral energy for a chosen number of wavelet coefficients are calculated using a moving short time window; this forms the feature extraction stage, which in turn, defines the inputs for the neural network which is used for classifying the types of fault. After the fault type is identified, the proposed scheme selects the specific neural network of the fault type to distinguish between internal and external faults by utilizing the same patterns features extracted from the previous stage. The input features comprise both the high and low frequency components to enhance performance of the scheme. An extensive series of studies for a whole variety of different system and fault conditions clearly show that the performance of the scheme both for fault classification and detection is accurate and robust.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344762","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to EHV transmission line fault classification and fault detection based on the wavelet transform and artificial intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to EHV transmission line fault classification and fault detection based on the wavelet transform and artificial intelligence","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344762/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170115","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to EHV transmission line fault classification and fault detection based on the wavelet transform and artificial intelligence","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093773S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6344790,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Wrinch","affiliation":["Hedgehog Technologies, Inc., North Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Michael C Wrinch (M'01) Received his B.A.Sc. degree in 2000 and M.A.Sc. degree from Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada and his PhD from the University of British Columbia where he specialized in power system island detection.

The application is demonstrated for a large practical power system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344797/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170150","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of an SVC to damp sub-synchronous interaction between wind farms and series compensated transmission lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an SVC to damp sub-synchronous interaction between wind farms and series compensated transmission lines","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066691S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344803,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Lavaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Precourt Institute for Energy, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Lavaei","id":"37300831800"},{"name":"David Tse","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tse","id":"37274371600"},{"name":"Baosen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Baosen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085749646"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6344803","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":733},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Optimization","Network topology","Topology","Thermal stability","Admittance","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","minimisation","Pareto optimisation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power flow geometry","tree networks","tree topology","optimal power flow problem","injection region","bus power injections","Pareto-optimal points","increasing function minimization","linear transformation","higher -power flow region","two-bus power flow regions","angle difference","convex hull","active bus power constraints","variable voltage magnitude"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the problem of power flow and its relationship to optimization in tree networks. We show that due to the tree topology of the network, the general optimal power flow problem simplifies greatly. Our approach is to look at the injection region of the power network. The injection region is simply the set of all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation constraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region, since they are the solutions to the minimization of increasing functions. We view the injection region as a linear transformation of the higher dimensional power flow region, which is the set of all feasible power flows, one for each direction of each line. We show that if the voltage magnitudes are fixed, then the injection region becomes a product of two-bus power flow regions, one for each line in the network. Using this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the angle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull. Therefore, the optimal power flow problem can be convexified and efficiently solved. This result improves upon earlier works since it does not make any assumptions about the active bus power constraints. We also obtain some partial results for the variable voltage magnitude case.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344803","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344803.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometry of power flows in tree networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Geometry of power flows in tree networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344803/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170155","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometry of power flows in tree networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10713S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6344837,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The WAPOD uses voltage phase angle signals from two distant locations in the Norwegian grid as inputs to the damping controller. The damping controller modulates the voltage reference set point used by the SVC's voltage controller, thereby creating a damping effect. The WAPOD is an extension to the existing Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller that uses local measurements. A switch-over logic allows for the use of no damping control, local damping control or wide-area control. Field tests were performed during November 2011, and involved the disconnection and re-connection of a 420 kV transmission line. The performance of the WAPOD is compared to that of state-of-the-art local Phasor POD, and when no damping control is enabled. The testing results show that the WAPOD performed satisfactorily and according to the design expectations. These results show that the potential flexibility of the WAPOD to choose, among the different PMU signals, those that have the good observability of inter-area modes can be an advantage to the use of local feedback signals for damping control, as it is current practice today. Further testing of this WAPOD with other PMU signals from locations with stronger observability will be helpful to illustrate the advantage of this flexibility.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344837","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344837.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damper implementation and testing in the Norwegian transmission network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damper implementation and testing in the Norwegian transmission network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344837/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170187","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damper implementation and testing in the Norwegian transmission network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064907S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6344839,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Nevertheless, the development of new PMU data-based WAMPAC applications has been relatively slow. The great potential of WAMPAC systems is being limited by this, and efforts are needed so that new applications can be developed. The slow rate of development of these applications is strongly related to, among other factors, the application development approach used. This article starts by discussing the needs and approaches for developing WAMPAC applications that exploit synchronized phasor measurements, and illustrates how one of these approaches has been achieved. A preliminary work carried out to develop and implement a Smart Transmission System Laboratory (SmarTS Lab), a hardware and software-based system for developing and analyzing \u201cSmart Transmission Grids\u201d paradigms and applications for WAMPAC systems, are described. The laboratory's conceptual architecture and hardware and software implementation are presented, and some of its components are described. Finally, the article illustrates proof-of-concept examples of how PMU data-based applications can be developed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Real-time systems","Software","Data models","Hardware","Monitoring","Communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","control engineering computing","laboratories","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","power transmission control","power transmission protection","smart power grids","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SmarTS lab","WAMPAC systems","smart transmission grids","synchronized phasor measurement data testing","wide-area monitoring-protection and control systems","PMU data-based WAMPAC applications","smart transmission system laboratory","hardware-software-based system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronized Phasor Measurements","PMU","Wide-Area Monitoring Systems","Wide-Area Control Systems","Wide-Area Protection Systems","Wide-Area Monitoring Protection and Control Systems","Smart Transmission Grids","Real-Time Simulation","SmarTS Lab"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344839","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344839.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SmarTS Lab \u2014 A laboratory for developing applications for WAMPAC Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SmarTS Lab \u2014 A laboratory for developing applications for WAMPAC Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344839/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344839/","accessionNumber":"13170189","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SmarTS Lab \u2014 A laboratory for developing applications for WAMPAC Systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067295S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6344853,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, the uncertainty and intermittent generation pattern in wind farms and the complexity of demand side management pose huge challenges. In this paper, we analytically investigate how to integrate DR and wind energy with fossil fuel generators to (i) minimize power generation cost; and (2) fully take advantage of the wind energy with the managed demand to reduce greenhouse emission. We first build a two-stage robust unit commitment (UC) model to obtain day-ahead generator schedules where wind uncertainty is captured by a polytopic uncertainty set. Then, we extend our model to include DR strategy such that both price levels and generator schedules will be derived for the next day. For these two challenging models, we derive their mathematical properties and develop a novel solution method. Our computational study on an IEEE 118-bus system with 36 units shows that robust UC models can fully make use of wind generation with less generation cost. Also, the developed algorithm is computationally superior to classical Benders decomposition method.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344860","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust unit commitment problem with demand response and wind energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust unit commitment problem with demand response and wind energy","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344860/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170209","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6344860/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust unit commitment problem with demand response and wind energy","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092979S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6344881,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav S.

In each time slot, a given microgrid may produce more than, less than or as much power as it needs, and there is uncertainty on which of these events may occur. The microgrids with excess power, those with deficit power and the macrogrid trade power in an electricity market, in which each microgrid with excess power quotes a price for it and the microgrids with deficit power buy power from the microgrids who quote the lowest prices. This results in price competition among the microgrids with excess power, and this competition has several distinguishing features not normally present in price competition in traditional markets studied in economics. We analyze this price competition using the framework of game theory, explicitly compute a Nash Equilibrium and show its uniqueness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344881/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13170229","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344881/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pricing games among interconnected microgrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing games among interconnected microgrids","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115103S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6344886,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Ghoddami","affiliation":["University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6344886/6344886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamidreza Ghoddami (S10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 1995, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Urmia University in 1998, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), London, ON, Canada.","His research interests include design, modeling, and control of photovoltaic energy conversion systems.

The proposed PV system consists of multiple dc-dc boost converters and one large inverter. The inverter is based on the neutral-point clamped (NPC) technology with a grounded dc-link midpoint. This enables a bipolar structure and doubles the net dc voltage, while the 600-V North American standard is respected. The boost converters independently control the dc voltages of their corresponding PV arrays, while their output voltages are regulated by the inverter. Further, they limit the dc-link voltage of the inverter if the power cannot be dispatched to the grid, for example, due to network faults or failure of the inverter. The proposed PV system also offers an enhanced MPPT performance and energy yield, due to its multi-MPPT capability. The NPC technology permits the employment of low-voltage switches for the inverter, despite the doubled net dc voltage. Principles of operation, mathematical model, and control schemes of the proposed PV system are described in the paper. Further, the performance of the proposed PV system is demonstrated through time-domain simulations and study cases that include system startup, normal operation, shading and partial shading scenarios, and various faults.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Voltage control","Harmonic analysis","Power system harmonics","Photovoltaic systems","Radiation effects","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","photovoltaic power systems","power generation faults","power generation reliability","power grids","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar two-stage photovoltaic system","three-level neutral-point clamped converter","PV system","large-scale grid-connected applications","multiple DC-DC boost converters","large inverter","NPC technology","grounded dc-link midpoint","bipolar structure","North American standard","PV arrays","network faults","multiMPPT capability","low-voltage switches","mathematical model","PV system control schemes","time-domain simulations","voltage 600 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boost converter","control","photovoltaic (PV)","power electronics","single-stage PV system","three-level neutralpoint clamped (NPC) converter","two-stage PV system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344886","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344886.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bipolar two-stage photovoltaic system based on three-level neutral-point clamped converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6344886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bipolar two-stage photovoltaic system based on three-level neutral-point clamped converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344886/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344886/","accessionNumber":"13170234","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bipolar two-stage photovoltaic system based on three-level neutral-point clamped converter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064805S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6344917,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Rafael Segundo Sevilla","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6344917/6344917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Felix Rafael Segundo Sevilla was born in Zamora, Mexico.

However, the challenge is to guarantee a minimum level of dynamic performance with only the local signal following sudden loss of remote signals. A case study on the Nordic equivalent system is presented to show that the closed-loop response could deteriorate once the remote signals are lost. A fault-tolerant control (FTC) design methodology is presented to solve this problem and ensure an acceptable performance level even in case of loss of remote signals. The FTC design methodology is based on simultaneous pole-placement for normal and loss of (remote) signals conditions along with minimisation of control effort. The problem is solved non-iteratively using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Under the normal condition (when both local and remote signals are present) the fault-tolerant controller (FTC) requires more control effort as compared to a conventional controller (CC) in order to achieve the same performance. However, case studies on the Nordic equivalent system confirm that the proposed FTC is able to produce acceptable performance in case of loss of the remote signals while the response with a CC is unacceptable.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344917","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06344917.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant wide-area control for power oscillation damping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant wide-area control for power oscillation damping","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6344917/","accessionNumber":"13170258","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6344917/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant wide-area control for power oscillation damping","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064213S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6344917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6344969,"authors":[{"name":"Raffi Sevlian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6344969/6344969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raffi Sevlian received his BS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California Berkeley in 2007 and is currently persuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.

The interior point method (IPM) is used to solve the model. Due to the special structure of the proposed model, the size of coefficient of correction equations in the IPM can be reduced to the same as Jacobian in the conventional Newton method. Further, the coefficient is symmetrical positive-definite with a diagonal perturbation, which leads to a better convergence than Newton direction. The model and algorithm proposed also have the following features: (1) no special initial value is needed; (2) strong robustness for power grids with plenty of small/negative impedance; (3) applicable for searching a desirable operation point by appropriate settings of inequality constraints; (4) striving for ultimate close to power flow solution avoiding to stop too early at a local minimizer. Numerical simulations on a 6527 buses power grid in China with 8 HVDC lines show that the proposed model has robust convergent property in the feasible region, around the boundary of the feasible region and even beyond the feasible region of power flow.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345044","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345044.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of non-linear programming for large-scale AC-DC power flow analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345044/","displayDocTitle":"Application of non-linear programming for large-scale AC-DC power flow analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170377","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345044/","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of non-linear programming for large-scale AC-DC power flow analysis","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077039S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6345053,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Ran","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaohong Ran was born in Chongqing Province, China in 1984.

Considering the rising of energy transformation efficiency, and the coefficient is decreasing which power converts into coal, so the transformation of different energy will change with production status. So we set out to research the problem from the angle of pollutant emission based on heat equivalent (HE), and proposed the principle of equal emission (PEE) that can reflect the dynamic transformation between cold heat and power, and establish the dynamic transformation model of different energy. Thereafter, the model of multi-objective economic dispatch is formulated including generation cost and environmental cost of CCHP based on the PEE, and then we solve the problem with the fuzzy optimization programming. The results show that PEE is important in economic dispatch and reducing emission, the more important is that it can reflect the change of energy production more accurately; it also provides the reference for the promotion of environmental dispatch of CCHP.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345053","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345053.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The multi-objective optimization dispatch of Combined Cold Heat and Power based on the principle of equal emission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"The multi-objective optimization dispatch of Combined Cold Heat and Power based on the principle of equal emission","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13170386","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345053/","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The multi-objective optimization dispatch of Combined Cold Heat and Power based on the principle of equal emission","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012000923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05688S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6345075,"authors":[{"name":"F.

As a result, several researches have been made to locate the PMUs for complete system observability. Many protection applications are based upon the PMUs locations. This paper introduces an important application in power system protection which is the detection of single line outage. In addition, a detection of the outaged line is achieved depending on the variations of phase angles measured at the system buses where the PMUs are located. Hence, a protection scheme from unexpected overloading in the network that may lead to system collapse can be achieved. Such detections are based upon an artificial intelligence technique which is the support Vector Machine (SVM) classification tool. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the algorithm is tested using offline simulation for the 14-bus IEEE system.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345116","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345116.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line outage detection using support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Line outage detection using support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) technology","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13170447","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345116/","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line outage detection using support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) technology","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071862S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6345146,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J Berrisford","affiliation":["BC Hydro Load Analysis Group, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew J","lastName":"Berrisford","id":"37395947400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6345146","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Harmonic analysis","Digital signal processing","Registers","Total harmonic distortion","Power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","IEEE standards","power measurement","smart meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart meters","power quantity","IEEE Standard 1459","DSP technology","nonsinusoidal condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Revenue Metering","Power Definitions","Harmonics","IEEE 1459-2010"]}],"abstract":"For over a century, most revenue meters have been unable to separate the distortion components from metered power quantities, leading to inaccurate measurements under non-sinusoidal conditions.

The approach is based on the consensus + innovations framework, in which each network agent participates in a collaborative process of neighborhood message exchange and local computation. The distributed approach is shown to converge to the optimal dispatch under rather weak assumptions on the agent communication network connectivity. Intuitively, the proposed approach includes a consensus term which achieves convergence to a common incremental cost value and an innovation term which ensures that the total generation is equal to the load to be supplied. Further, in the proposed approach each network bus only needs to be aware of its local cost parameters and the local predicted load and the neighborhood communication involves exchanging only the locally determined marginal energy price with a few neighbors. Robustness of the proposed approach and techniques for convergence rate improvement are discussed. Finally, simulation studies on the benchmark IEEE 14 bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed robust economic dispatch in power systems: A consensus + innovations approach","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345156","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345156.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed robust economic dispatch in power systems: A consensus + innovations approach","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345156/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170486","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed robust economic dispatch in power systems: A consensus + innovations approach","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081817S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6345178,"authors":[{"name":"Fengji Luo","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN), University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Fengji","lastName":"Luo","id":"37400605900"},{"name":"Zhao Yang Dong","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN), University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhao Yang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37275835400"},{"name":"Yingying Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539668400"},{"name":"Yan Xu","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN), University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37403527500"},{"name":"Ke Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Meng","id":"37391145800"},{"name":"Kit Po Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Kit Po","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278685000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6345178","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid cloud computing platform: The next generation IT backbone for smart grid","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345178.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345178","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Power system stability","Smart grids","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","power engineering computing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid cloud computing platform","next generation IT backbone","smart grid","power system applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Distributed Computing","Smart Grid"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345178","abstract":"This paper discusses the prospective of applying cloud computing technologies in the development of smart grid.

Using micro grid continuous-time model and control design impose a huge computational burden due to the required high sampling rate to achieve stability when utilizing a digital controller. Thus, developing of an advanced discrete-time (DT) stabilizing controller design is of paramount importance in the micro grids. In this paper a nonlinear discrete-time stabilizing controller using Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is proposed for micro grids by employing the discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) optimal control method. The designed optimal controller is applied to control the UPFC's series voltage and to optimally mitigate the power oscillations. The micro grid under consideration is comprised of a synchronous generator, renewable energy sources, and loads. The UPFC series voltage is considered as control input and the optimal strategy is applied. A discretized micro grid nonlinear dynamical model is derived and successive approximation method is utilized to approximate the cost function of the generator states and the UPFC control parameters. Finally, a neural network (NN) is utilized to approximate the cost function using the weighted residual method. By applying the developed optimal controller, it is shown that oscillations caused by faults are mitigated more effectively compared to the conventional generator controllers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345181/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13170511","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345181/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control of UPFC using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formulation based neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of UPFC using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formulation based neural network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091164S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6345255,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Verma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Verma","id":"38485047100"},{"name":"K.

In this work, our previous result is extended to OPF with arbitrary convex cost functions and then a more rigorous theoretical foundation is provided accordingly. First, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the solvability of OPF in polynomial time through its Lagrangian dual. Since solving the dual of OPF is expensive for a large-scale network, a far more scalable algorithm is designed by utilizing the sparsity in the graph of a power network. The computational complexity of this algorithm is related to the number of cycles of the network. Furthermore, it is proved that due to the physics of a power network, the polynomial-time algorithm proposed here always solves every full AC OPF problem precisely or after two mild modifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345272.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physics of power networks makes hard optimization problems easy to solve","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shifters","Polynomials","Cost function","Computational complexity","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distribution networks","load flow","optimisation","polynomials","transmission networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power networks","optimization problems","optimal power flow problem","quadratic cost function","polynomial time","IEEE benchmark systems","arbitrary convex cost functions","solvability","Lagrangian dual","large-scale network","graph sparsity","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Physics of power networks makes hard optimization problems easy to solve","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170826","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physics of power networks makes hard optimization problems easy to solve","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106759S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6345319,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromu Kobayashi","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6345319/6345319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiromu Kobayashi (M'2010) was born on December 28, 1956.

In order to suppress the swings more efficiently, the global dynamics of different areas are required, and then the synchrophasor measurement techniques are becoming necessary for real time and continuous control. In this paper, the design, implementation and commission of a coordinated wide-area adaptive damping control (WADC) system through the modulations of multiple HVDC links in China Southern Power Grid (CSG) are presented. Based on the calculations of observability and controllability, six phasor measurement units (PMU) and three HVDC links were chosen to be included in this system. The controllers were coordinated to damp two dominant inter-area oscillation modes. Another key issue for the wide-area control system is the random time delay and a solution using low-pass filter was proposed. Based on the improved online Prony identification, the controller parameters can be adapted according to the changes of the oscillation frequency. The above WADC were implemented and tested in the CSG real time digital simulations (RTDS) platform, which is composed of more than 10 racks of RTDS, real HVDC control and protection cubicles. After field debugging and trial operations, the WADC system was further validated in the practical CSG through artificial block and de-block of three different HVDC links and tripping a 500kV AC tie-line in the years of 2008 and 2009. The field test results show that the commission of WADC system can increase the damping ratio of the dominant modes more than 10%.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345363","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345363.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementations and experiences of wide-area HVDC damping control in China Southern Power Grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Implementations and experiences of wide-area HVDC damping control in China Southern Power Grid","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345363/","accessionNumber":"13170910","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345363/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementations and experiences of wide-area HVDC damping control in China Southern Power Grid","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049609S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6345371,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled H.

The Genetic Algorithm optimizes the number of charging and discharging plug-in electric vehicles in order to efficiently manage voltage unbalances and power losses. The plug-in electric vehicle based on a voltage controlled representation is incorporated into a power flow formulation suitable for radial and unbalance distribution network. The PEV model comprises a voltage source converted (VSC) and a battery pack. While active power is regulated at the storage device according to the charging and discharging status of battery, the voltage magnitude at the point of common coupling is regulated by the VSC. Furthermore, a comprehensive VSC-based PEV equivalent model that accurately reflects the behavior of a distributed vehicular fleet is proposed in this work to carry-out efficient steady-state analyses. The impact of a plug-in vehicular fleet in the voltage unbalance of the IEEE 13-node test feeder is optimized with a multiobjective genetic algorithm, where each PEV is modeled as a Tesla Roadster EV with a lithium-ion battery pack.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345384","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345384.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage unbalance analysis of distribution systems using a three-phase power flow ans a Genetic Algorithm for PEV fleets scheduling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power conversion","Voltage control","Batteries","Genetic algorithms","Reactive power","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","distribution networks","genetic algorithms","load flow","power convertors","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage unbalance analysis","distribution systems","PEV fleets scheduling","three-phase distribution power flow method","plug-in electric vehicular fleets scheduling","voltage unbalance management","power losses","voltage controlled representation","power flow formulation","radial distribution network","unbalance distribution network","PEV model","voltage source convertor","active power regulation","storage device","battery charging","battery discharging","voltage magnitude","point of common coupling regulation","VSC-based PEV equivalent model","distributed vehicular fleet","steady-state analyses","IEEE 13-node test feeder","multiobjective genetic algorithm","Tesla Roadster EV","lithium-ion battery pack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["plug-in electric vehicle","voltage source converter","distribution power flow","voltage unbalance","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Voltage unbalance analysis of distribution systems using a three-phase power flow ans a Genetic Algorithm for PEV fleets scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170930","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage unbalance analysis of distribution systems using a three-phase power flow ans a Genetic Algorithm for PEV fleets scheduling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053027S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6345408,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Antoine","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, BEAMS Energy, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6345408/6345408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Antoine was born in Brussels, Belgium, on February 24, 1984.

Therefore, identifying the components influencing negatively the oscillations damping is extremely challenging. The method proposed in this paper analyzes some variables monitored by phasor measurement units (PMU) in order to have a better understanding of the oscillation behavior. The influence of the following parameters is studied: the topology, the load model, power flows or the presence of fast exciters. The method works by clustering the mode frequency, the voltage angle difference between areas and the mode shapes. All of these variables can be given by PMUs. Starting from a sufficiently damped power system, the proposed clustering determines the main cause of a damping decrease. The weaknesses of the power system can then be emphasized to help the operators to take the appropriate actions to reinforce their system. The method is illustrated on a 4-machine test system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Oscillators","Damping","Load modeling","Generators","Phasor measurement units","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oscillations","phasor measurement","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-area oscillations","phasor measurement units","power grid","power system components","PMU","damped power system","4-machine test system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inter-area oscillations","phasor measurement units (PMU)","damping","clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345408","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345408.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-area oscillations: Identifying causes of poor damping using phasor measurement units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inter-area oscillations: Identifying causes of poor damping using phasor measurement units","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345408/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345408/","accessionNumber":"13170954","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-area oscillations: Identifying causes of poor damping using phasor measurement units","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056248S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6345419,"authors":[{"name":"Volker Diedrichs","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences, Wilhelmshaven, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6345419/6345419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alfred Beekmann was born in 1965 in Aurich, Germany.

Wind power plants (WPP) feeding in their power by means of voltage source converters (VSC) have the potential to be operated in those high impedance grids to a certain extent if they are appropriately controlled. The physical boundaries are well known and referred to as voltage collapse and loss of angle stability (generic: loss of stability, LOS). Measurements and simulations indicate the potential of advanced wind turbines (WT) based on VSC to approach the ultimate physical LOS limits very effectively.

Electrical mobility means the usage of battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) as the main future technology to combat greenhouse gas emissions. The burden of electric mobility will be mainly on the distribution system that, particularly during the peak hours, will be exposed to critical operation conditions by a high number of high density simultaneous loads. Vehicle-to-Grid technology by adding control capabilities to charge and discharge of cars' batteries can exalt the benefits from their whole energy storage capacity. Distributors can then be helped in the active management of the network by the services offered (e.g., VAR/volt regulation, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, integration of renewable generation).

As part of the future EV infrastructure, a Large Scale Charging (LSC) facility is capable of charging hundreds of electric vehicles simultaneously. As an intelligent load in the future smart grid, LSC requires properly designed pricing and scheduling algorithms that take into account the electricity consumed, the arrival-departure characteristics, and overall charging capacity. The scheduling of LSC is formulated as a deadline scheduling problem. Utility functions that combine both amount of charge and tightness of the deadline are proposed. Under arbitrary (and deterministic) arrival, departure, and charging characteristics, a scheduling policy referred to as deadline scheduling with admission control is proposed. The proposed algorithm achieves the highest competitive ratio (against the best offline scheduling) for the utility function linear in charging level among all online scheduling algorithms. It also offers significant gain over benchmark scheduling algorithms such as the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling and the First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling in terms of average performance for general utility functions when tested with randomly generated charging requests.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345497/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13171039","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345497/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Large scale charging of Electric Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale charging of Electric Vehicles","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085232S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6345545,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Duan","affiliation":["Vestas Technology Research and Development, Marlborough, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Duan","id":"38510139200"},{"name":"Hamid Toliyat","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Toliyat","id":"37271706600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6345545","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":892},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Rotors","Temperature measurement","Stator windings","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","machine windings","permanent magnet machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","permanent magnet machine","fault diagnosis technique","PM machine","rotor eccentricity","magnet fault","unbalanced magnetic pull","short-circuit winding","open-circuit winding","associated detection method"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents a preliminary review of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques for permanent magnet (PM) machines based only on journal papers published after 1990.

Reports by the North American Reliability Corporation show that \u201cfrequency response\u201d, that is, the severity and recovery of grid frequency following large disturbances (typically trip of large thermal generation plants) has been declining over the past two decades. The addition of substantial amounts of wind power plants, and in the near future large amounts of solar photovoltaic generation, complicates the issue. A typical wind plant appears to the grid as a substantially different generation source than a conventional power plant. Without special controls, a wind plant does not inherently participate in the regulation of grid frequency. By contrast, synchronous machines always contribute to system inertia, and a fraction of the synchronous generation in operation at any point have governor controls enabled. When wind and solar generation displaces conventional synchronous generation, the mix of the remaining synchronous generators changes and has the potential to adversely impact overall frequency response. The paper summarizes results from a recent study of system frequency response in California and the Western US. Impacts of wind and solar generation on frequency response are shown. Various aspects impacting frequency response, including fraction of generation providing governor response, governor response withdrawal, and use of frequency responsive wind plant controls are presented.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345564","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345564.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency response of California and WECC under high wind and solar conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345564/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency response of California and WECC under high wind and solar conditions","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345564/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170628","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency response of California and WECC under high wind and solar conditions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074873S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6345595,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hassanzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Hassanzadeh (S\u2019 09) received the B.S. degree from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2004 and the M.S. degree from University of Nevada, Reno in 2011.

The uncertainty and variability due to high penetration of wind makes reliable system operations and controls challenging. In this paper, an optimal control strategy is proposed to coordinate energy storage and diesel generators to maximize wind penetration while maintaining system economics and normal operation performance. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with the goals of minimizing fuel costs and changes in power output of diesel generators, minimizing costs associated with low battery life of energy storage, and maximizing the ability to maintain real-time power balance during operations. Two control modes are considered for controlling the energy storage to compensate either net load variability or wind variability. Model predictive control (MPC) is used to solve the aforementioned problem and the performance is compared to an open-loop look-ahead dispatch problem under high penetration of wind. Simulation studies using different prediction horizons further demonstrate the efficacy of the closed-loop MPC in compensating for uncertainties in the system caused by wind and demand.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal control of distributed energy resources using model predictive control","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345596","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal control of distributed energy resources using model predictive control","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345596/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal control of distributed energy resources using model predictive control","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07069S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6345600,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Chehreghani Bozchalui","affiliation":["Energy Management Department, NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6345600/6345600-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Chehreghani Bozchalui (S'05- M'11) received a PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a major in Power and Energy Systems from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2011.

VGs are simplified representations of groups of coherent synchronous generators in a power system. They resemble commonly used power system dynamic equivalents obtained via generator aggregation techniques. Traditionally power system dynamic equivalents are developed offline, fixed, and used to replace large portions of the system that are considered external to the portion of the system being analyzed in detail. In contrast, VGs are calculated online, are not limited to representing external areas of the system being analyzed/controlled, and do not replace any portion of the power system. Instead, they allow wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) to exploit the realization that a group of coherent synchronous generators in a power system can be controlled as a single generating unit for achieving wide-area damping control objectives. The implementation of VGs is made possible by the availability of Wide-Area Measurements (WAMs) from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the use of power system equivalencing techniques has been extended to real-time WADC. Simulation studies carried out on the 68-bus New England/New York power system demonstrate that intelligent controllers developed using VGs can significantly improve the stability of a power system by effectively damping low-frequency interarea oscillations.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345608","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345608.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual generators: Simplified online power system representations for wide-area damping control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Virtual generators: Simplified online power system representations for wide-area damping control","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345608/","accessionNumber":"13170671","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345608/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual generators: Simplified online power system representations for wide-area damping control","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056267S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6345635,"authors":[{"name":"Sushanta Paul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6330648/6343905/6345635/6345635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sushanta Paul received his Bachelor's degree (Electrical Engineering, 2003) from the University of Burdwan, India, and his MBA from West Bengal University of Technology, India, in 2006 and M.

Here, both the power loss index (PLI)-based approach and the loss sensitivity coefficient-based approach are comparatively studied to determine the optimal capacitor location. The index-based approach combined with a genetic algorithm is used to determine the capacitor sizes. We also discuss about how customer loads and costs change after reactive power compensation. The proposed method were tested on the IEEE 13-bus and 34-bus test systems, and the results are comparatively analyzed and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345635/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13170698","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345635/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal capacitor placement and sizes for power loss reduction using combined power loss index-loss sensitivity factor and genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal capacitor placement and sizes for power loss reduction using combined power loss index-loss sensitivity factor and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116809S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6345638,"authors":[{"name":"David Elizondo","affiliation":["Quanta Technology, LLC, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["David Elizondo, PhD., is a Principal Advisor and has more than 17 years of electric power systems experience, 10 years in the USA and 7 years in Mexico.

To reduce the voltage rise, the excess amount of power from the solar PV units needs to be reduced. In this paper, distributed storage systems are proposed for the mitigation of voltage rise problem. The surplus energy from the solar PV is used to charge the distributed storage units during midday, when the power from the solar PV would be typically higher than the load level. This stored energy is then used to reduce the peak load in the evening. An intelligent strategy for charging and discharging control to make effective use of the storage capacity is discussed. The proposed voltage rise mitigation strategy is verified on a practical low voltage distribution feeder in Australia.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345726","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed energy storage for mitigation of voltage-rise impact caused by rooftop solar PV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed energy storage for mitigation of voltage-rise impact caused by rooftop solar PV","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345726/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13170780","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed energy storage for mitigation of voltage-rise impact caused by rooftop solar PV","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070713S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6345728,"authors":[{"name":"Junjian Qi","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Power Systems, Department Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junjian","lastName":"Qi","id":"38059393700"},{"name":"Guangyu He","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Power Systems, Department Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"He","id":"37285540700"},{"name":"Shengwei Mei","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Power Systems, Department Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengwei","lastName":"Mei","id":"37276289700"},{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Power Systems, Department Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275918900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2729-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2727-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2728-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9925"}],"articleNumber":"6345728","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Power systems","Voltage measurement","Transmission line measurements","Power measurement","Noise measurement","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system set membership state estimation","SMSE","bounded-error context","interval constraint propagation","IEEE bus systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interval analysis","constraint propagation","power system state estimation","set membership estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a power system set membership state estimator (SMSE) in a bounded-error context is proposed based on interval constraint propagation.

Our approach is to formulate the volt/var control as a radial optimal power flow (OPF) problem to minimize line losses and energy consumption, subject to constraints on voltage magnitudes. An efficient solution to the radial OPF problem is presented and used to study the structure of optimal inverter var injection and the net benefits, taking into account the additional cost of inverter losses when operating at non-unity power factor. This paper will illustrate how, depending on the circuit topology and its loading condition, the inverter's optimal reactive power injection is not necessarily monotone with respect to their real power output. The results are demonstrated on a distribution feeder on the Southern California Edison system that has a very light load and a 5 MW photovoltaic (PV) system installed away from the substation.","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345736","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330648/6343905/06345736.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6343905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration","conferenceDate":"22-26 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345736/","accessionNumber":"13170789","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345736/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal inverter VAR control in distribution systems with high PV penetration","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2012001918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058425S","chronDate":"22-26 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330648","isNumber":"6343905","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330648","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"6343905","articleId":"6345736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6345754,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shahidehpour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Shahidehpour (F'01) is Bodine Distinguished Professor and Director of the Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)."]},"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Shahidehpour","id":"37272476200"},{"name":"Mohammad Khodayar","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad E Khodayar (M'99) received his MS degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 2006.

Such teams often use online tools such as mailing lists, bug tracking systems or online discussion forums to communicate, clarify or coordinate work on requirements. In this kind of environment, the expected evolution from initial idea, through clarification, to a stable requirement, often stagnates. When project managers are not aware of underlying problems, development may proceed before requirements are fully understood and stabilized, leading to numerous implementation issues and often resulting in the need for early redesign and modification. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing online requirements communication and a method for the detection and classification of clarification events in requirement discussions.

Despite important research advances, as in the automated creation and maintenance of trace links, traceability implementation and use is still not pervasive in industry. A community of traceability researchers and practitioners has been collaborating to understand the hurdles to making traceability ubiquitous. Over a series of years, workshops have been held to elicit and enhance research challenges and related tasks to address these shortcomings. A continuing discussion of the community has resulted in the research roadmap of this paper.

Although the unobtrusive or unsupervised nature of such technologies often results in less accurate measures than their invasive or supervised counterparts, this disadvantage is typically outweighed by the ability to monitor larger populations than ever before. The expected consequential benefit will be an improvement in healthcare provision and health outcomes for all. The process of discovering indicators of health in unsupervised or unobtrusive biosignal recordings, or automatically ensuring the validity and quality of such signals, is best realized when following a proven systematic methodology. This paper provides a brief tutorial review of supervised learning, which is a sub-discipline of machine learning, and discusses its application in the development of algorithms to interpret biosignals acquired in unsupervised or semi-supervised environments, with the aim of estimating well-being. Some specific examples in the disparate application areas of telehealth electrocardiogram recording and calculating post-operative systemic vascular resistance are discussed in the context of this systematic approach for information discovery.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345870","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06345870.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of supervised learning to biological signals: ECG signal quality and systemic vascular resistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Applications of supervised learning to biological signals: ECG signal quality and systemic vascular resistance","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345870/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131378","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","pubMedId":"23365831","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345870/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of supervised learning to biological signals: ECG signal quality and systemic vascular resistance","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00151322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087614S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6345874,"authors":[{"name":"Duan-duan Liu","affiliation":["Joint Research Centre for Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Duan-duan","lastName":"Liu","id":"38502737600"},{"name":"Dong Liang","affiliation":["Paul C.

In this paper, we study how to adaptively design an under-sampling trajectory in the context of CS with systematic optimization and small complexity.

Typically, ablation is performed with an external therapeutic transducer. However, external HIFU treatment suffers from limitations of low therapeutic efficiency for ablation of tumors, deep in internal organs such as liver, kidney and brain. Interstitial HIFU through an internal transducer, implanted locally near the organ of interest, could alleviate some of these limitations. Furthermore, it can be attractive for point-of-care (POC) treatment. In this paper, we propose the design of a dual-functional implantable assembly for image-guided HIFU treatment of anomalous growth. It is realized by effective integration of a central HIFU array with two ultrasonic imaging arrays for high-resolution online monitoring and efficient treatment. We explore the design space for the implant and identify the major design parameters including the power requirement. Using a widely used simulation platform, we show that the proposed implant, besides providing a potential POC solution, achieves a better therapeutic performance for certain tumor positions in internal organs, than the extracorporeal HIFU treatment.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345898","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06345898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345898","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implantable ultrasonic dual functional assembly for detection and treatment of anomalous growth","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Implantable ultrasonic dual functional assembly for detection and treatment of anomalous growth","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345898/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131406","pubMedId":"23365859","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implantable ultrasonic dual functional assembly for detection and treatment of anomalous growth","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00470005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070955S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6345927,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas B.

The ASIC was created using an 0.18 micron Si fabrication process utilizing standard 1.8 volt CMOS transistors as well as 20 volt lightly doped drain FETs. The communication system receives frequency-shift keyed inputs at 6.78 MHz from an implanted secondary coil, and transmits data back to the control unit through a lower-bandwidth channel that employs load-shift keying. The design's safety is ensured by on-board electrode voltage monitoring, stimulus charge limits, error checking of data transmitted to the implant, and comprehensive self-test and performance monitoring features. Each stimulus cycle is initiated by a transmitted word with a full 32-bit error check code. Taken together, these features allow researchers to safely and wirelessly tailor retinal stimulation and vision recovery for each patient.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345927","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06345927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"292","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC design and data communications for the Boston retinal prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ASIC design and data communications for the Boston retinal prosthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345927/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131435","pubMedId":"23365888","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC design and data communications for the Boston retinal prosthesis","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00780359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077114S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6345936,"authors":[{"name":"Eric M.

To address this challenge we are exploring optimal methods to sample the input space. In this paper we present two methods for optimally sampling isometric muscle force recruitment curves. One method maximizes the information about the recruitment curve parameters, and the second method minimizes the average variance of the predicted output force. We compared these methods to two previously-used methods in simulation. The simulation model was identified from recruitment data collected during experiments with a human subject with a high spinal cord injury. The optimal sampling methods on average produced estimates of the output force with less error than the two previously-used methods. The optimal sampling methods require fewer system identification experiments to identify models with similar output prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345936/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131444","pubMedId":"23365897","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sampling of recruitment curves for functional electrical stimulation control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sampling of recruitment curves for functional electrical stimulation control","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00880852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05069S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6345948,"authors":[{"name":"Truong Minh-Chinh","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Faculty Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University of Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Truong","lastName":"Minh-Chinh","id":"38512690900"},{"name":"Tan Tran-Duc","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Faculty Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University of Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Tran-Duc","id":"38328248200"},{"name":"Nguyen Linh-Trung","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Faculty Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University of Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen","lastName":"Linh-Trung","id":"38343216800"},{"name":"Marie Luong","affiliation":["Laboratory Information Processing and Transmission, University of Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Luong","id":"37408152600"},{"name":"Minh N.

In this paper, we present a new way named Correlated Microwave-Acoustic Imaging (CMAI) of combining two microwave-based imaging modalities: confocal microwave imaging(CMI) by detecting scattered microwave signal, and microwave-induced thermo-acoustic imaging (TAI) by detecting induced acoustic signal arising from microwave energy absorption and thermal expansion. Necessity of combining CMI and TAI is analyzed theoretically, and by applying simple algorithm to CMI and TAI separately, we propose an image correlation approach merging CMI and TAI together to achieve better performance in terms of resolution and contrast. Preliminary numerical simulation shows promising results in case of low contrast and large variation scenarios. A UWB transmitter is designed and tested for future complete system implementation. This preliminary study inspires us to develop a new medical imaging modality CMAI to achieve real-time, high resolution and high contrast

However, these systems do not provide the ultrasound researchers access to transmit front-end module. This paper presents the development of a digital transmit beamformer system for generating simultaneous arbitrary waveforms, specifically designed for research purposes. The proposed architecture has 8 independent excitation channels and uses an FPGA (Field Programmable Gated Array) device for electronic steering and focusing of ultrasound beam. The system allows operation in pulse-echo mode, with pulse repetition rate of excitation from 62.5 Hz to 8 kHz, center frequency from 500 kHz to 20 MHz, excitation voltage over 100 Vpp, and individual control of amplitude apodization, phase angle and time delay trigger. Experimental results show that this technique is suitable for generating the excitation waveforms needed for medical ultrasound imaging researches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A programmable FPGA-based 8-channel arbitrary waveform generator for medical ultrasound research activities","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345981","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06345981.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A programmable FPGA-based 8-channel arbitrary waveform generator for medical ultrasound research activities","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6345981/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131488","pubMedId":"23365942","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable FPGA-based 8-channel arbitrary waveform generator for medical ultrasound research activities","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01370368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052772S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6345999,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is shown that both steady state and transient responses can be obtained from Ear-EEG, and that these responses have similar characteristics and quality compared to EEG obtained from conventional on-scalp recordings.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06345999.pdf","endPage":"589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auditory evoked responses from Ear-EEG recordings","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6345999","startPage":"586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6345999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Auditory evoked responses from Ear-EEG recordings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6345999/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13131506","pubMedId":"23365960","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6345999/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auditory evoked responses from Ear-EEG recordings","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01550345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05795S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6345999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6346005,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangjun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Urology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA","Zhijiang College, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37278849300"},{"name":"Yingchun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Urology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37422589300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346005","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Muscles","Surface treatment","Blind source separation","Electrodes","Educational institutions","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","electromyography","medical signal processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-density surface EMG decomposition","convolutive blind source separation approach","high density surface electromyography signals","motor unit firing patterns","surface EMG signals","contrast function maximization","iterative deflation approach","extracted source","motor unit action potential","automatic approach","well-designed computer simulation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Electromyography","Electromyography","Humans","Models, Neurological","Motor Neurons","Muscles","Muscles","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"A novel automatic approach is developed in the present study to decompose high density surface electromyography (EMG) signals into motor unit (MU) firing patterns.

We present spike-based coincidence detection using integrate-and-fire neural membrane dynamics along with pooled conductance-based synaptic dynamics in a hierarchical address-event architecture. Within this architecture, we encode each synaptic event with parameters that govern synaptic connectivity, synaptic strength, and axonal delay with additional global configurable parameters that govern neural and synaptic temporal dynamics.

We examine design tradeoffs between transmitted signal amplitude, reliability, noise and clock jitter. The IR-UWB system is modeled using measured parameters from a reported UWB transceiver implemented in 90nm-CMOS technology. Non-optimized inductive coupling coils with low-Q value for near-field data transmission are modeled in order to build a full channel from the transmitter (Tx) to the receiver (Rx). On-off keying (OOK) modulation is used together with a low-complexity convolutional error correcting code. The simulation results show that even though the low-Q coils decrease the amplitude of the received pulses, the UWB system can still achieve acceptable performance when error correction is used. These results predict that UWB is a good candidate for delivering high data rates in cortical implant devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346047.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"782","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"125Mbps ultra-wideband system evaluation for cortical implant devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Implants","Receivers","Jitter","Noise","Transceivers","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","CMOS integrated circuits","error correction codes","neurophysiology","noise","prosthetics","reliability","transceivers","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cortical implant devices","impulse ratio ultrawideband system","low-Q inductive coil link","near-field domain","transmitted signal amplitude","reliability","noise","clock jitter","IR-UWB system","UWB transceiver implementation","CMOS technology","nonoptimized inductive coupling coils","low-Q value","near-field data transmission","on-off keying modulation","low-complexity convolutional error correcting code","low-Q coils","error correction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomedical Engineering","Cerebral Cortex","Cerebral Cortex","Computer Simulation","Humans","Models, Neurological","Neural Prostheses","Remote Sensing Technology","Telemetry","Wireless Technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"125Mbps ultra-wideband system evaluation for cortical implant devices","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346047/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131553","pubMedId":"23366008","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"125Mbps ultra-wideband system evaluation for cortical implant devices","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02030238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078971S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346078,"authors":[{"name":"R.

They can provide dexterous operation in a small constrained environment. The kinematic model of a concentric-tube robot has been well developed in terms of accuracy, but the computational cost places limitations on real-time implementation. In this paper, we propose a new technique that will substantially improve the computational efficiency of evaluating the kinematics of a concentric-tube robot in the context of developing a control strategy without sacrificing the accuracy of the results. In this paper we develop a torsionally compliant kinematic model using global variables. The model is validated by comparing the results obtained by computing the kinematic model corresponding to an experimental setup of a concentric-tube robot to which a force/torque sensor has been mounted at its base with those obtained directly from the experimental setup. The results indicate that it is feasible to compute the kinematics of the concentric-tube robot fast enough to allow the position/force control loop to be implemented at a rate of 1 kHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346078.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346078","startPage":"904","endPage":"907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast torsionally compliant kinematic model of concentric-tube robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346078/","displayDocTitle":"A fast torsionally compliant kinematic model of concentric-tube robots","htmlLink":"/document/6346078/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13131582","pubMedId":"23366039","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast torsionally compliant kinematic model of concentric-tube robots","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02341803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063234S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6346094,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser A.

However, HR-ECoG has 400 times the resolution of conventional ECoG, making it a challenge to process, transmit and store the HR-ECoG data. Therefore, simple and efficient compression algorithms are vital for the feasibility of implantable wireless medical devices for HR-ECoG recordings. In this paper, following the observation that HR-ECoG signals have both high spatial and temporal correlations similar to video/image signals, various compression methods suitable for video/image- compression based on motion estimation, discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)- are investigated for compressing HR-ECoG data. We first simplify these methods to satisfy the low-power requirements for implantable devices. Then, we demonstrate that spatiotemporal compression methods produce up to 46% more data reduction on HR-ECoG data than compression methods using only spatial compression do. We further show that this data reduction can be achieved with low hardware complexity. In particular, among the methods investigated, spatiotemporal compression using DCT-based methods provide the best trade-off between hardware complexity and compression performance, and thus we conclude that DCT-based compression is a promising solution for ultralow-power implantable devices for HR-ECoG.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1015","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346105.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal compression for efficient storage and transmission of high-resolution electrocorticography data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346105/","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal compression for efficient storage and transmission of high-resolution electrocorticography data","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131607","pubMedId":"23366066","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal compression for efficient storage and transmission of high-resolution electrocorticography data","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"02611098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065807S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6346115,"authors":[{"name":"Yipeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) SCD-SISTA and IBBT Future Health Department, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yipeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38667397500"},{"name":"Ivan Gligorijevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) SCD-SISTA and IBBT Future Health Department, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Gligorijevic","id":"38234002800"},{"name":"Vladimir Matic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) SCD-SISTA and IBBT Future Health Department, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Matic","id":"37338597900"},{"name":"Maarten De Vos","affiliation":["Neuropsychology, Department of Psychology, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany","Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) SCD-SISTA and IBBT Future Health Department, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Maarten","lastName":"De Vos","id":"37698130200"},{"name":"Sabine Van Huffel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT) SCD-SISTA and IBBT Future Health Department, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Van Huffel","id":"37284277300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346115","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Optimization","Frequency domain analysis","Sparse matrices","Matching pursuit algorithms","Programming","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","convex programming","electromyography","medical signal processing","signal reconstruction","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisparse signal recovery","compressive sensing","original signal reconstruction","linear subNyquist measurements","classical methods","L0 norm optimization","multiple domains","convex programming model","linear measurement fitting constraint","a priori information","EMG signals","frequency domains","time domains"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Electromyography","Electromyography","Humans","Models, Biological","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"Signal recovery is one of the key techniques of compressive sensing (CS).

Several extensions of our decoding method are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346178","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346178.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1313","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transductive neural decoding for unsorted neuronal spikes of rat hippocampus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Transductive neural decoding for unsorted neuronal spikes of rat hippocampus","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131674","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","pubMedId":"23366139","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346178/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transductive neural decoding for unsorted neuronal spikes of rat hippocampus","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03401157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100741S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6346187,"authors":[{"name":"Hubertus Rehbaum","affiliation":["Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University G\u00f6ttingen, Gottingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hubertus","lastName":"Rehbaum","id":"38467289600"},{"name":"Ning Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University G\u00f6ttingen, Gottingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37528893000"},{"name":"Liliana Paredes","affiliation":["Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University G\u00f6ttingen, Gottingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Liliana","lastName":"Paredes","id":"38505584700"},{"name":"Sebastian Amsuess","affiliation":["Otto Bock HealthCare Products GmbH, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Amsuess","id":"38495677600"},{"name":"Bernhard Graimann","affiliation":["Strategic Technology Management, Otto Bock HealthCare GmbH, Duderstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Graimann","id":"37270471900"},{"name":"Dario Farina","affiliation":["Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University G\u00f6ttingen, Gottingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Farina","id":"37284365600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346187","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":692},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Wrist","Signal processing algorithms","Training","Real-time systems","Proportional control","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","diseases","electromyography","medical control systems","medical signal processing","proportional control","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time simultaneous control","real time proportional control","multiple degrees of freedom","surface EMG","limb deficiency","surface electromyographic signals","residual limbs","limb deficiency","virtual object","residual muscle activities","goal-oriented tasks","multifunctional prosthetic control"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adolescent","Adult","Algorithms","Amputees","Electromyography","Electromyography","Feedback","Female","Humans","Male","Prostheses and Implants","Self-Help Devices","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"abstract":"We present the real time simultaneous and proportional control of two degrees of freedom (DoF), using surface electromyographic signals from the residual limbs of three subject with limb deficiency.

The algorithm first performs dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, and then the image is segmented using k-means clustering. The mean spectrum from each cluster is then calculated and can be used to extract chemical information. By reducing the number of spectra to be analyzed, extraction of physiological information can be achieved three orders of magnitude faster than methods requiring the analysis of every spectrum in the hyperspectral dataset. The effect of noise on the ability of the algorithm to accurately segment images was tested using digital phantoms, for which the noise level was under the control of the investigators. The analysis showed a linear relationship between the level of noise and the smallest difference in scattering that the algorithm was able to accurately detect and segment. This finding can be used to determine the maximum amount of noise in the imaging system that will still allow detection of the difference in optical properties between non-melanoma and melanoma.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346221","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"1482","endPage":"1485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of diffuse reflectance hyperspectral datasets with noise for detection of Melanoma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of diffuse reflectance hyperspectral datasets with noise for detection of Melanoma","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346221/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131713","pubMedId":"23366182","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346221/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of diffuse reflectance hyperspectral datasets with noise for detection of Melanoma","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"03831744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068857S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346229,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37439786100"},{"name":"Dae-Seung Kim","affiliation":["Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Seung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239624200"},{"name":"Sung-Won Kang","affiliation":["Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Won","lastName":"Kang","id":"38503820200"},{"name":"Won-Jin Yi","affiliation":["Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Dental Research Institute, School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Jin","lastName":"Yi","id":"37274299000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346229","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":390},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346229","abstract":"With the advent of technology, multi-energy X-ray imaging is promising technique that can reduce the patient's dose and provide functional imaging.

To acquire multi-energy images, Monte Carlo simulation was performed. The X-ray spectrum was modeled and ripple effect was considered. Using the dissimilar characteristics in energy-dependent X-ray attenuation of each material, multiple energy X-ray images were decomposed into material depth images. Feedforward neural network was used to fit multi-energy images to material depth images. In order to use the neural network, step wedge phantom images were used for training neuron.

In this paper, we propose a low-power ADC architecture for neural implants that process extracellular potentials. The proposed architecture uses the spike detector that is readily available on most of these implants in a closed-loop with an ADC. The spike detector determines whether the current input signal is part of a spike or it is part of noise to adaptively determine the instantaneous sampling rate of the ADC. The proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption of a traditional ADC by 62% when sampling extracellular potentials without any significant impact on spike detection accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Accuracy","Extracellular","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","bioelectric potentials","cellular biophysics","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","extracellular potential","neural implant","digital signal processor","epileptic seizure detection","limb control","spike detector","power consumption"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Analog-Digital Conversion","Electric Power Supplies","Electrophysiology","Extracellular Space","Feedback, Physiological","Signal-To-Noise Ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346266","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346266.pdf","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing analog-to-digital converters for sampling extracellular potentials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing analog-to-digital converters for sampling extracellular potentials","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346266/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346266/","accessionNumber":"13131756","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","pubMedId":"23366227","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing analog-to-digital converters for sampling extracellular potentials","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04282081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039698S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6346267,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Y Abualhoul","affiliation":["Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mohammad Y","lastName":"Abualhoul","id":"38505907600"},{"name":"Pontus Svenmarker","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pontus","lastName":"Svenmarker","id":"38270816500"},{"name":"Qin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Nanophysics, Acreo AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37278380500"},{"name":"Jan Y.

Especially implanted brain-computer interfaces gives rise to large data sets that needs to be transmitted transcutaneous. In this paper we show that it is possible to establish such a link at near-IR wavelengths using a modulated reflector in the implant, thus keeping the laser and the detector on the outside. In addition, we show that it will not only work on short, i.e. touch, distances but also at larger distances, in the range of a meter. We have used an electro absorption modulator to modulate the reflection of an external laser source back towards an external detector. The only part of this system that needs to be implanted is the modulator and drive electronics. The study has been done both by Monte-Carlo simulations of a multi-layer model of a rat skull, and with an experiment demonstrating the feasibility of the link when transmitted through biological tissue. The results show that it is possible to establish a transcutaneous link with an external laser source and light detector, and an internal modulated reflector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and

To overcome the limitations of traditional BCI system with conventional wet sensors, a wireless and wearable multi-channel EEG-based BCI system is proposed in this study, including the wireless EEG data acquisition device, dry spring-loaded sensors, a size-adjustable soft cap. The dry spring-loaded sensors are made of metal conductors, which can measure the EEG signals without skin preparation and conductive gel. In addition, the proposed system provides a size-adjustable soft cap that can be used to fit user's head properly. Indeed, the results are shown that the proposed system can properly and effectively measure the EEG signals with the developed cap and sensors, even under movement.

Previous feature extraction methods used power spectra density values dervied from Fourier Transform or sub-band energy and entropy derived from Wavelet Transform. These feature extracion methods eliminate temporal information which are essential for analyzing EEG signals. The DWT coefficients represent the degree of correlation between the analyzed signal and the wavelet function at different instances of time; therefore, DWT coefficients contain temporal information of the analyzed signal. The proposed feature extraction method fully utilizes the simultaneous time-frequency analysis of DWT by preserving the temporal information in the DWT coefficients. In this paper, we also study the effects of using different wavelet functions (Coiflets, Daubechies and Symlets) on the performance of the emotion recognition system. The input EEG signals were obtained from two electrodes according to 10-20 system: F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p1</sub>\n and F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p2</sub>\n. Visual stimuli from International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were used to induce two emotions: happy and sad. Two classifiers were used: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results confirmed that the proposed DWT coefficients method showed improvement of performance compared to previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346410","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"2251","endPage":"2254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform coefficients for emotion recognition from EEG signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Wavelet Transform coefficients for emotion recognition from EEG signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118621","pubMedId":"23366371","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete Wavelet Transform coefficients for emotion recognition from EEG signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05720245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057051S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6346424,"authors":[{"name":"Craig K.

We apply the ideal observer approach in a simulation environment to evaluating the role of mechanical index limits on task performance in b-mode ultrasonic imaging. We simulate a linear array operating at 15MHz and 60% fractional bandwidth, and consider three tasks related to breast sonography at a depth of 4cm. The ideal observer suggests that there are gains in performance - and hence the quantity of diagnostic information - as the limit on mechanical index is raised. However these gains are almost completely erased after computation of a standard b-mode envelope.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346424/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13118635","pubMedId":"23366385","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346424/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An ideal observer approach to mechanical limits in b-mode ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ideal observer approach to mechanical limits in b-mode ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"05861359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045792S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6346476,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqub Jon Mohamadi","affiliation":["Department of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Yaqub","lastName":"Jon Mohamadi","id":"37086768683"},{"name":"Govinda Poudel","affiliation":["Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, New Zealand Brain Research Institute, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Govinda","lastName":"Poudel","id":"37588609600"},{"name":"Carrie Innes","affiliation":["New Zealand Brain Research Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Carrie","lastName":"Innes","id":"37600137500"},{"name":"Richard D.

However, little is known about the relative performance of these beamformers. In this study, 8 scalar beamformers were examined with respect to several parameters to determine how effective they are at reconstruction of a dipole time course from EEG. A simulated EEG signal was produced by means of forward head modelling for projection of an artificial dipole on scalp electrodes then superimposed on background signal. Both real EEG and white noise were applied as background activity. Although the eigenspace beamformer can perform slightly better than other beamformers for small dipoles, and even more so for large dipoles, it is not a contender for real-time beamforming of EEG as it cannot be completely automated. Overall, in terms of performance, robustness to variations in parameters, and ease of application, the minimum variance and Borgiotti-Kaplan beamformers were found to be the best performers.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346476","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346476.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346476","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"2517","endPage":"2521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of beamformers on EEG source reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance of beamformers on EEG source reconstruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346476/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118687","pubMedId":"23366437","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of beamformers on EEG source reconstruction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06460365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106151S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346485,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Song","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Song","id":"37333901600"},{"name":"Ioan Opris","affiliation":["Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, Wake Forest University, School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Opris","id":"37075008900"},{"name":"Rosa H.

To gain insights into the neurobiological mechanism of such high-order cognitive functions, it is important to understand the input-output transformational properties of the PFC micro-circuitry. In this study, we identify the functional connectivity between the Layer 2/3 (input) neurons and the Layer 5 (output) neurons using a previously developed generalized Volterra model (GVM). Input-output spike trains are recorded from the PFCs of nonhuman primates performing a memory-dependent delayed match-to-sample task with a customized conformal ceramic multi-electrode array. The GVM describes how the input spike trains are transformed into the output spike trains by the PFC micro-circuitry and represents the transformation in the form of Volterra kernels. Results show that Layer 2/3 neurons have strong and transient facilitatory effects on the firings of Layer 5 neurons. The magnitude and temporal range of the input-output nonlinear dynamics are strikingly different from those of the hippocampal CA3-CA1. This form of functional connectivity may have important implications to understanding the computational principle of the PFC.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346485","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346485.pdf","startPage":"2555","endPage":"2558","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional connectivity between Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 neurons in prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates during a delayed match-to-sample task","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Functional connectivity between Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 neurons in prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates during a delayed match-to-sample task","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346485/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118696","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","pubMedId":"23366446","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346485/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional connectivity between Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 neurons in prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates during a delayed match-to-sample task","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06551483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052296S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6346556,"authors":[{"name":"Rafid Sukkar","affiliation":["Voxelon, Inc., Niles, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rafid","lastName":"Sukkar","id":"37353879000"},{"name":"Elyse Katz","affiliation":["Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Elyse","lastName":"Katz","id":"38496039900"},{"name":"Yanwei Zhang","affiliation":["Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38506795000"},{"name":"David Raunig","affiliation":["Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Raunig","id":"38501725600"},{"name":"Bradley T.

In some diseases the distinct clinical stages of the disease progress far too slowly to enable a quick evaluation of the efficacy of a given proposed treatment. To help improve the assessment of disease progression, we propose using Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) to model, in a more granular fashion, disease progression as compared to the clinical stages of the disease. Unlike many other applications of Hidden Markov Models, we train our HMM in an unsupervised way and then evaluate how effective the model is at uncovering underlying statistical patterns in disease progression by considering HMM states as disease stages. In this study, we focus on AD and show that our model, when evaluated on the cross validation data, can identify more granular disease stages than the three currently accepted clinical stages of \u201cNormal\u201d, \u201cMCI\u201d (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and \u201cAD\u201d.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346556","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"2845","endPage":"2848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disease progression modeling using Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Disease progression modeling using Hidden Markov Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346556/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118766","pubMedId":"23366517","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346556/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disease progression modeling using Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07440071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059367S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6346567,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni I.

The other is the reliability of heart rate estimation, defined by the acceleration. Experimental results while our test subjects were running came closer to the holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) in high accuracy (r = 0.98, SD = 8.7 bpm).

The focus of the study is to determine the discriminating EEG features of AD patients while subjected to cognitive and auditory tasks, since AD is characterized by progressive impairments in cognition and memory. At each recording block, DWT extracts EEG features corresponding to major brain frequency bands. T-test and Kruskal-Wallis methods were used to determine the statistically significant features of EEG signals from AD patients compared to Controls. A decision tree algorithm was then used to identify the dominant features for AD patients. It was determined that the mean value of the low-\u03b4 (1 - 2 Hz) frequency band during the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test with 2.0 (s) interval and the mean value of the \u03b4 frequency band (12 - 30 Hz) during 6 Hz auditory stimulation have higher mean values in AD patients than Controls. Due to artifacts, the less reliable low-\u03b4 features were removed and it was determined that the mean value of \u03b2 frequency band during 6 Hz auditory stimulation followed by the standard deviation of \u03b8 (4 - 8 Hz) frequency band of one card learning cognitive task are higher for AD patients compared to Controls and thus the most dominant discriminating features of the disease.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology

Cardioid based graph has given a reasonably good classification accuracy in terms of differentiating between individuals. However, the current feature extraction method using Euclidean distance could be further improved by using Mahalanobis distance measurement producing extracted coefficients which takes into account the correlations of the data set. Identification is then done by applying these extracted features to Radial Basis Function Network. A total of 30 ECG data from MITBIH Normal Sinus Rhythm database (NSRDB) and MITBIH Arrhythmia database (MITDB) were used for development and evaluation purposes. Our experimentation results suggest that the proposed feature extraction method has significantly increased the classification performance of subjects in both databases with accuracy from 97.50% to 99.80% in NSRDB and 96.50% to 99.40% in MITDB. High sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 99.17%, 99.91% and 99.23% for NSRDB and 99.30%, 99.90% and 99.40% for MITDB also validates the proposed method.

Due to the fact that ECG signals can be well approximated by the few linear combinations of wavelet basis, this work introduces a comparison of the reconstructed 10 ECG signals based on different wavelet families, by evaluating the performance measures as MSE (Mean Square Error), PSNR (Peak Signal To Noise Ratio), PRD (Percentage Root Mean Square Difference) and CoC (Correlation Coefficient). Reconstruction of the ECG signal is a linear optimization process which considers the sparsity in the wavelet domain. L1 minimization is used as the recovery algorithm. The reconstruction results are comprehensively analyzed for three compression ratios, i.e. 2:1, 4:1, and 6:1. The results indicate that reverse biorthogonal wavelet family can give better results for all CRs compared to other families.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346696","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"3404","endPage":"3407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG signal compression using Compressive Sensing and wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ECG signal compression using Compressive Sensing and wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346696/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131921","pubMedId":"23366657","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346696/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG signal compression using Compressive Sensing and wavelet transform","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10070118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06508S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6346722,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Bulach","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Bulach","id":"38511140600"},{"name":"Ulrich Bihr","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Bihr","id":"38468744200"},{"name":"Maurits Ortmanns","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Maurits","lastName":"Ortmanns","id":"37270110800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346722","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":514},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Sorting","Noise level","Neurons","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","biomedical measurement","compressed sensing","data analysis","data compression","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","prosthetics","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","neural spike recordings","neural action potential signals","MATLAB","neural recorders","neural activity","low-power design","implanted neural recorder","wireless transmission","unrestricted data analysis","receiver","neural data sets","CS","6-level Daubechies-8 wavelet decomposition matrix","learned dictionary matrices","spike sorting program OSort","low-noise synthesized neural spike signals","neural data compression"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Evaluation Studies as Topic","Humans","Neurons"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an evaluation study of compressed sensing (CS) for neural action potential (spike) signals in MATLAB is presented. State-of-the-art neural recorders use 100 or more parallel channels to measure neural activity resulting in a data rate of 16 - 20 Mbit/s. Since a low-power design is required for an implanted neural recorder, it seems advantageous to compress the neural data prior to the wireless transmission. The continuous neural spike signals are compressed and transmitted to facilitate the possibility of an unrestricted data analysis at the receiver. Synthesized and recorded neural data sets are used to test the performance of CS. The 6-level Daubechies-8 wavelet decomposition matrix and two learned dictionary matrices are utilized as dictionaries for CS. The compression results are evaluated with the spike sorting program OSort. CS is shown to work for the compression of low-noise synthesized neural spike signals with a compression rate of 2.05, but cannot be recommended for the compression of neural spike signals in general.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation study of compressed sensing for neural spike recordings","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346722","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346722.pdf","startPage":"3507","endPage":"3510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation study of compressed sensing for neural spike recordings","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346722/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13131947","pubMedId":"23366683","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation study of compressed sensing for neural spike recordings","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10330287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139159S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6346729,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"38467763800"},{"name":"Ulrich Bihr","affiliation":["Faculty of Institute of Microelectronics, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Bihr","id":"38468744200"},{"name":"Syed M.

In order to support the early detection of melanoma, melanoma screening systems have been extensively studied and developed. Recently we have proposed a melanoma discrimination index derived from hyperspectral data (HSD) in the visible-near infrared wavelength region. The index represents variegation in spectra over a lesion and works well in discriminating melanoma from other pigmented lesions. However the previous hyperspectral imager did not have an enough allowance for measurement of lesions. To overcome the problem with it, we have developed a hyperspectral imager attached to imaging fiberscope. This equipment has been able to accumulate HSD in a view field of \u03c640 mm within about 10 seconds, from which the above-mentioned melanoma discrimination index has been calculated. Performance of the system has been studied in nine cases of melanoma and 18 cases of non-melanoma, obtained from patients and volunteers, all of whom were Japanese. The index has achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94.4%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology

The BCG signal is measured with a piezoelectric film sensor under the mattress topper, and sent to the web server for analysis. Heart rate and respiratory variation, activity, sleep stages, and stress reactions are inferred based on the signal. The sleep information is presented to the user along with measurements of the sleeping environment (temperature, noise, luminosity) and user-logged tags (e.g. stress, alcohol, exercise). The approach is designed for long-term use at home, allowing users to follow the development of their sleep over months and years. The service has also a medical use, as sleep disorder patients can be measured for long periods before and after interventions.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346791","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346791.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"3784","endPage":"3788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unobtrusive online monitoring of sleep at home","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unobtrusive online monitoring of sleep at home","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346791/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132014","pubMedId":"23366752","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unobtrusive online monitoring of sleep at home","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"12080757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089984S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6346825,"authors":[{"name":"T.

and application to virtual colonoscopy","abstract":"One of the key challenges in three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging is to enable the fast turn-around time, which is often required for interactive or real-time response. This inevitably requires not only high computational power but also high memory bandwidth due to the massive amount of data that need to be processed. In this work, we have developed a software platform that is designed to support high-performance 3D medical image processing for a wide range of applications using increasingly available and affordable commodity computing systems: multi-core, clusters, and cloud computing systems. To achieve scalable, high-performance computing, our platform (1) employs size-adaptive, distributable block volumes as a core data structure for efficient parallelization of a wide range of 3D image processing algorithms; (2) supports task scheduling for efficient load distribution and balancing; and (3) consists of a layered parallel software libraries that allow a wide range of medical applications to share the same functionalities. We evaluated the performance of our platform by applying it to an electronic cleansing system in virtual colonoscopy, with initial experimental results showing a 10 times performance improvement on an 8-core workstation over the original sequential implementation of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6346842/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132065","pubMedId":"23366803","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scalable, high-performance 3D imaging software platform: System architecture and application to virtual colonoscopy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable, high-performance 3D imaging software platform: System architecture and application to virtual colonoscopy","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"12702080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035214S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6346878,"authors":[{"name":"Pitamber Shukla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Pitamber","lastName":"Shukla","id":"38466570500"},{"name":"Ishita Basu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ishita","lastName":"Basu","id":"37600354200"},{"name":"Daniel Graupe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Graupe","id":"37371934500"},{"name":"Daniela Tuninetti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Tuninetti","id":"37284288200"},{"name":"Konstantin V.

This paper demonstrates an adaptive closed-loop controlled DBS that, after switching off stimulation, tracks few physiological signals to predict the reappearance of tremor before the patient experiences discomfort, at which point it instructs the DBS controller to switch on stimulation again. The core of the proposed approach is a Neural Network (NN) which effectively extracts tremor predictive information from non-invasively recorded surface-electromyogram(sEMG) and accelerometer signals measured at the symptomatic extremities. A simple feed-forward back-propagation NN architecture is shown to successfully predict tremor in 31 out of 33 trials in two Parkinson's Disease patients with an overall accuracy of 75.8% and sensitivity of 92.3%. This work therefore shows that closed-loop DBS control is feasible in the near future and that it can be achieved without modifications of the electrodes implanted in the brain, i.e., is backward compatible with approved DBS systems.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346878","startPage":"4140","endPage":"4143","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based design of an on-off adaptive control for Deep Brain Stimulation in movement disorders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346878/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based design of an on-off adaptive control for Deep Brain Stimulation in movement disorders","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346878/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13118833","pubMedId":"23366839","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based design of an on-off adaptive control for Deep Brain Stimulation in movement disorders","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"13150814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114766S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6346883,"authors":[{"name":"Aadeel Akhtar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and with the Medical Scholars Program, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Urbana, IL 61801, USA"],"firstName":"Aadeel","lastName":"Akhtar","id":"38469639500"},{"name":"Levi J.

However, recent studies have separately shown that the joint angles corresponding to shoulder orientation and upper arm EMG can predict the joint angles corresponding to elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/ supination, which would allow for simultaneous control over both degrees of freedom. In this preliminary study, we show that the combination of both upper arm EMG and shoulder joint angles may predict the distal arm joint angles better than each set of inputs alone. Also, with the advent of surgical techniques like targeted muscle reinnervation, which allows a person with an amputation intuitive muscular control over his or her prosthetic, our results suggest that including a set of EMG electrodes around the forearm increases performance when compared to upper arm EMG and shoulder orientation. We used a Time-Delayed Adaptive Neural Network to predict distal arm joint angles.

This comparison indicates that the powered prosthesis and running controller are able to provide essential features of a healthy running gait.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A running controller for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346885","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346885.pdf","startPage":"4168","endPage":"4171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A running controller for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346885/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118840","pubMedId":"23366846","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A running controller for a powered transfemoral prosthesis","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"13250653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062643S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346920,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrasekhar Bhagavatula","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Chandrasekhar","lastName":"Bhagavatula","id":"38507062800"},{"name":"Shreyas Venugopalan","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shreyas","lastName":"Venugopalan","id":"37587434800"},{"name":"Rebecca Blue","affiliation":["University of Texas, Galveston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Blue","id":"38027110100"},{"name":"Robert Friedman","affiliation":["Noninvasive Medical Technologies, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Friedman","id":"38235422100"},{"name":"Marc O Griofa","affiliation":["Noninvasive Medical Technologies, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Marc O","lastName":"Griofa","id":"38015950600"},{"name":"Marios Savvides","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Savvides","id":"37272021900"},{"name":"B.V.K.

This could allow the identification of subjects in operational and potentially hostile environments. Features extracted from the continuous and discrete wavelet decompositions of the signal are investigated for biometric identification. In the former case, the most discriminative features in the wavelet space were extracted using a Fisher ratio metric. Comparisons in the wavelet space were done using the Euclidean distance measure. In the latter case, the signal was decomposed at various levels using different wavelet bases, in order to extract both low frequency and high frequency components. Comparisons at each decomposition level were performed using the same distance measure as before. The data set used consists of four subjects, each with a 15 minute RFII recording. The various data samples for our experiments, corresponding to a single heart beat duration, were extracted from these recordings. We achieve identification rates of up to 99% using the CWT approach and rates of up to 100% using the DWT approach. While the small size of the dataset limits the interpretation of these results, further work with larger datasets is expected to develop better algorithms for subject identification.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346920.pdf","startPage":"4311","endPage":"4314","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometric identification of cardiosynchronous waveforms utilizing person specific continuous and discrete wavelet transform features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Continuous wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Spectrogram","Heart beat"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cardiology","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","radiofrequency heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometric identification","cardiosynchronous waveforms","continuous wavelet transform features","discrete wavelet transform features","radio frequency impedance interrogation","RFII","feature extraction","Fisher ratio metric","Euclidean distance measure","CWT","DWT"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometry","Cardiography, Impedance","Conductometry","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Heart","Heart Function Tests","Humans","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Wavelet Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Biometric identification of cardiosynchronous waveforms utilizing person specific continuous and discrete wavelet transform features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118874","pubMedId":"23366881","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometric identification of cardiosynchronous waveforms utilizing person specific continuous and discrete wavelet transform features","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"13601079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086479S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346924,"authors":[{"name":"Errikos M.

The visual processing of wholenight sleep EEG recordings is tedious. Therefore, various techniques have been proposed for automatically detecting sleep spindles. In the present work an automatic sleep spindle detection system, that has been previously proposed, using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN), is evaluated in detecting spindles of both healthy controls, as well as MCI and AD patients. An investigation is carried also concerning the visual detection process, taking into consideration the feedback information provided by the automatic detection system. Results indicate that the sensitivity of the detector was 81.4%, 62.2%, and 83.3% and the false positive rate was 34%, 11.5%, and 33.3%, for the control, MCI, and AD groups, respectively.

This papers aims at clarifying the role of texture and color features. Furthermore, the proposed systems is based on features which can be easily implemented and tested by other researchers.

Compressive sensing may therefore also find use as a novel method for the identification of EMG artefacts in other electro-physiological signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal agnostic compressive sensing for Body Area Networks: Comparison of signal reconstructions","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346966","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06346966.pdf","startPage":"4497","endPage":"4500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6346966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Signal agnostic compressive sensing for Body Area Networks: Comparison of signal reconstructions","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6346966/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118920","pubMedId":"23366927","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal agnostic compressive sensing for Body Area Networks: Comparison of signal reconstructions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"14061236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090438S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6346966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6346967,"authors":[{"name":"Bryson Padasdao","affiliation":["University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Bryson","lastName":"Padasdao","id":"38321408000"},{"name":"Roxanne Yee","affiliation":["Pronk Technologies, Inc., Honolulu, USA"],"firstName":"Roxanne","lastName":"Yee","id":"38503025200"},{"name":"Olga Boric-Lubecke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, USA"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Boric-Lubecke","id":"38277504400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6346967","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6346967","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","System-on-a-chip","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Biosensors","Radio frequency","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","biosensors","comparators (circuits)","data communication","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-on-chip implementation","respiratory rate detection","biosensor","patient mobility","regular battery replacement","sensor power usage","comparator","wireless data transmission"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Electric Power Supplies","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Humans","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Reproducibility of Results","Respiratory Rate","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Spirometry","Wireless Technology"]}],"abstract":"Recent biosensors can measure respiratory rate non-invasively, but limits patient mobility or requires regular battery replacement.

classification of surface electromyography signals. This work presents a comparison of various feature extraction and classification methods on a large-scale surface electromyography database containing 52 different hand movements obtained from 27 subjects. Results indicate that simple feature representations as Mean Absolute Value and Waveform Length can achieve similar performance to the computationally more demanding marginal Discrete Wavelet Transform. With respect to classifiers, the Support Vector Machine was found to be the only method that consistently achieved top performance in combination with each feature extraction method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347099/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119025","pubMedId":"23367034","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347099/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the challenge of classifying 52 hand movements from surface electromyography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the challenge of classifying 52 hand movements from surface electromyography","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"15170303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064758S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6347110,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Jaeger","affiliation":["National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Jaeger","id":"37270098300"},{"name":"Alexandros Karargyris","affiliation":["National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Karargyris","id":"37392744200"},{"name":"Sameer Antani","affiliation":["National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Antani","id":"37276389500"},{"name":"George Thoma","affiliation":["National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Thoma","id":"37276393900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6347110","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":539},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","X-rays","Image segmentation","Biomedical imaging","Diagnostic radiography","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","diseases","image segmentation","lung","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuberculosis detection","combined lung masks","tuberculosis diagnosis","automated approach","conventional posteroanterior chest radiographs","TB screening system","lung shape model","segmentation mask","intensity model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Lung","Mass Screening","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Radiography, Thoracic","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"]}],"abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health threat in many regions of the world, while diagnosing tuberculosis still remains a challenge. Mortality rates of patients with undiagnosed TB are high. Modern diagnostic techniques are often too slow or too expensive for highly-populated developing countries that bear the brunt of the disease. In an effort to reduce the burden of the disease, this paper presents an automated approach for detecting TB on conventional posteroanterior chest radiographs. The idea is to provide developing countries, which have limited access to radiological services and radiological expertise, with an inexpensive detection system that allows screening of large parts of the population in rural areas. In this paper, we present results produced by our TB screening system. We combine a lung shape model, a segmentation mask, and a simple intensity model to achieve a better segmentation mask for the lung. With the improved masks, we achieve an area under the ROC curve of more than 83%, measured on data compiled within a tuberculosis control program.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347110","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06347110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","startPage":"4978","endPage":"4981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting tuberculosis in radiographs using combined lung masks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detecting tuberculosis in radiographs using combined lung masks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347110/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13119036","pubMedId":"23367045","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6347110/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting tuberculosis in radiographs using combined lung masks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"15282010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08598S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347113,"authors":[{"name":"David Welch","affiliation":["School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Welch","id":"37533133000"},{"name":"Jennifer Blain Christen","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jennifer Blain","lastName":"Christen","id":"37298279700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6347113","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Monitoring","Metals","Capacitance","Capacitive sensors","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biological techniques","bioMEMS","biosensors","cellular biophysics","CMOS integrated circuits","ion sensitive field effect transistors","microfluidics","operational amplifiers","packaging","pH"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS biosensor system","on-chip cell culture","read-out circuitry","microfluidic packaging","metal layers","ion sensitive field effect transistors","ISFET","pH solutions","interdigitated electrode structures","sensing cellular attachment","sensing cellular proliferation","IDES test structures","test amplifiers","bandgap reference test structures","cell culture environment","incorporated sensors","preliminary electrical characterization","common mode rejection ratio","packaging technique","flexible pcb substrate","bandwidth 1.65 kHz","gain 48 dB","gain 72 dB"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Biosensing Techniques","Cell Culture Techniques","Cells, Cultured","Conductometry","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Humans","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Transistors, Electronic","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347113","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347113","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","abstract":"A 1.5 mm \u00d7 3 mm CMOS chip with sensors for monitoring on-chip cell cultures has been designed.

The chip contains ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs), as well as ISFETs with read-out circuitry, for monitoring the pH of solutions placed on top of the chip.

We designed the chip to accommodate packaging into an environment where it will be directly exposed to a cell culture environment. Specifically we designed the chip to have the incorporated sensors near the center of the chip allowing for connections made around the edge of the chip to be sealed off using an epoxy or similar material to prevent shorting. Preliminary electrical characterization results for our amplifier indicate a gain of 48 dB, a bandwidth of 1.65 kHz, and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 72 dB.

The PCAN extracted the spike features with the dimension reduced and correlation eliminated; The SOM network perform the spike distribution in the feature space, thus after convergence, the weights of the neurons demonstrate the spike cluster distribution in the feature space; At last the spike sorting was finished by computing the neurons' Normal Boundary Response (NBR) which determined the neurons' classes.

The procedure included two phases: 1) coregistration of volumes and 2) tissue characterization. Concerning the first phase, the DICOM images were reassembled spatially and resampled with isotropic 0.5mm resolution. Coregistration was performed by two multiresolution rigid transformations, merging head and neck volumes, plus a final multiresolution non rigid transformation. The anatomical 3D CE-VIBE volume was taken as reference. The procedure for tissue characterization is semi automated and it required a radiologist to identify an example of tissue from the primary tumor and a metastatic lymph node. We generated a 8-dimensional membership function to perform a fuzzy-like identification of these tissues. The result of this procedure was the generation of two maps, which showed complementary characterization of lymph nodes and carcinoma. A few example will be shown to evidence the potentiality of this method in identification and characterization of NPC lesions.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347198","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual

or the Z-axis of the sample being imaged. A stack of multiple such images is called a Z-stack image. The focus capability offered by Z-stack images is critical for many digital pathology applications. A single Z-stack image may result in several hundred gigabytes of data, and needs to be compressed for archival and distribution purposes. Currently, the existing methods for compression of Z-stack images such as JPEG and JPEG 2000 compress each focal plane independently, and do not take advantage of the Z-signal redundancy. It is possible to achieve additional compression efficiency over the existing methods, by exploiting the high Z-signal correlation during image compression. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for compression of Z-stack images, which we term as ZPEG. ZPEG extends the popular discrete-cosine transform (DCT) based image encoder to compress Z-stack images. This is achieved by decorrelating the neighboring layers of the Z-stack image using differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM). PSNR measurements, as well as subjective evaluations by experts indicate that ZPEG can encode Z-stack images at a higher quality as compared to JPEG, JPEG 2000 and JP3D at compression ratios below 50:1.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132163","pubMedId":"23367156","htmlLink":"/document/6347221/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ZPEG: A hybrid DPCM-DCT based approach for compression of Z-stack images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ZPEG: A hybrid DPCM-DCT based approach for compression of Z-stack images","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"16551361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075181S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347225,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung O.

In this paper, a new discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to estimate the permittivity arrangements of lossy multilayer structures, which represent body tissue models. Microwave imaging (AMI) is the modality in which the proposed algorithm is used for reconstructing the image. The main objective of this article is to depict the flexibility of PSO-based methods in handling complex problems expeditiously and successfully. Our new algorithm improves the estimation time by 85% as compared to our previous proposed one. Here, the impact of various parameters, namely, the AMI frequency, the immersion medium, the number of agents, the smoothing coefficient, and the maximum velocity, on the estimation performance are studied in terms of the maximum estimation error. It is demonstrated that by choosing the parameters correctly, one can achieve estimation results with a maximum error less that 10% in only 0.1 minute.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347237","startPage":"5490","endPage":"5493","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6320834/6345844/06347237.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for estimating dielectric constants of tissue","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric constant","Optimization","Estimation","Particle swarm optimization","Smoothing methods","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical imaging","image reconstruction","medical image processing","microwave imaging","multilayers","particle swarm optimisation","permittivity","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm","dielectric constants","permittivity arrangements","lossy multilayer structures","body tissue models","microwave imaging","image reconstruction","PSO","AMI frequency","immersion medium","smoothing coefficient"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Microwaves","Models, Biological"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A novel discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for estimating dielectric constants of tissue","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13132178","pubMedId":"23367172","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for estimating dielectric constants of tissue","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"16711275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074062S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6347242,"authors":[{"name":"Shane M.

In the same way, in microelectronics, the design process of very complex circuits has benefited from many years of experience. It is now partly automated through Electronic Design Automation tools. Both areas present analogies that can be used to create a Genetic Design Automation tool inspired from EDA tools used in digital electronics. This tool would allow moving away from a totally manual design of bio-systems to assisted conception. This ambitious project is presented in this paper, with a deep focus on the tool that automatically generates models of bio-systems directly usable in electronic simulators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6347247/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13132188","pubMedId":"23367182","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using digital electronic design flow to create a Genetic Design Automation tool","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using digital electronic design flow to create a Genetic Design Automation tool","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"16811028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070296S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6347273,"authors":[{"name":"Changmok Choi","affiliation":["Future IT Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changmok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37578575300"},{"name":"Younho Kim","affiliation":["Future IT Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37559907700"},{"name":"Kunsoo Shin","affiliation":["Future IT Research Center, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kunsoo","lastName":"Shin","id":"37362642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1787-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4119-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1094-687X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1557-170X"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"6347273","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","PD control","Computer aided software engineering","Detection algorithms","Noise","Resistance","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","electrocardiography","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PD control based QRS detection algorithm","wearable ECG applications","proportional-derivative control","arrhythmia ECG data","QRS wave interval","QRS wave magnitude","bradycardia","arioventricular block","sensitivity","positive predictive value","real time mobile ECG monitoring system"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Humans"]}],"abstract":"We present a QRS detection algorithm for wearable ECG applications using a proportional-derivative (PD) control.

To resolve the problem, PD control is applied to avoid missing a small QRS wave followed from a large QRS wave and to avoid falsely detecting noise as QRS waves when an interval between two adjacent QRS waves is large (e.g. bradycardia, pause, and arioventricular block). ECG data was obtained from 78 patients with various cardiovascular diseases and tested for the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The overall sensitivity and positive predictive value were 99.28% and 99.26%, respectively.

Recently, Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has become a popular method to visualize and diagnose the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Estimating the exact location of the capsule when each image is taken is a very critical issue in capsule endoscopy. Most of the common capsule localization methods are based on estimating one or more location-dependent signal parameters like TOA or RSS. However, some unique challenges exist for in-body localization due to the complex nature within the human body. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage localization method based on spatial sparsity in 3D space. In this method, we directly estimate the location of the capsule (as the emitter) without going through the intermediate stage of TOA or signal strength estimation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation with an RF signal following the allowable power and bandwidth ranges according to the standards. The results show that the proposed method is very effective and accurate even in massive multipath and shadowing conditions.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347302","publicationTitle":"2012 Annual

source localization using particle swarm optimization: A clinical experiment","abstract":"One of the most important steps of pre-surgical diagnosis in patients with medically intractable epilepsy is to find the precise location of the epileptogenic foci. An Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive standard tool used at epilepsy surgery center for pre-surgical diagnosis. In this paper a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method is applied to a real EEG data, i.e., a somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) measured from a healthy subject, to solve the EEG source localization problem. A high resolution 1 mm hexahedra finite element volume conductor model of the subject's head was generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data. An exhaustive search pattern and the MPSO method were then applied to the peak of the averaged SEPs data. The non-invasive EEG source analysis methods localized the somatosensory cortex area where our clinical expert expected the received SEPs. The proposed inverse problem solver found the global minima with acceptable accuracy and reasonable number of iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347418/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119090","pubMedId":"23367353","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347418/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non-invasive EEG source localization using particle swarm optimization: A clinical experiment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-invasive EEG source localization using particle swarm optimization: A clinical experiment","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"18900310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10408S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6320834","isNumber":"6345844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6320834","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6345844","articleId":"6347418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6347425,"authors":[{"name":"Melvin K.

CR users employ slotted Aloha as a random access scheme and can access the channel when it is not occupied by the PUs. We have derived new expressions for the throughput of both CR network and overall network to evaluate the channel utilization.

The simulation results obtained under various network load conditions are precisely match with the analytical results.

In this paper, one studies the use of beamforming from an energy efficiency viewpoint in UMTS and LTE. Several user scenarios, with different users' arrangements, were studied. Models were implemented to evaluate the potential impact that adaptive antennas can have to reduce the radiated power, compared to the current use of base station static sector antennas. With the use of beamforming, UMTS has a lot of interference suppression potential, besides signal improvement, enabling quite an increase in energy efficiency; LTE, due to the different multiple access technique, presents a different behaviour, coming from signal improvement. Through a statistical analysis, a model for UMTS that describes the achievable energy improvement as a function of the number of users and antennas is derived. For UMTS with carriers near top capacity, an energy reduction of 90% is achieved. For LTE, significant energy improvements are reached, 65% saving being obtained with 8 antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347575/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13116889","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347575/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency using beamforming at the base station in UMTS and LTE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency using beamforming at the base station in UMTS and LTE","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569631515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054024S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335511","isNumber":"6347558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335511","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6347558","articleId":"6347575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347585,"authors":[{"name":"U.

We design the precoding such that the inter-cell interference subspace from the previous transmission is aligned at the desired receiver with the intra-cell interference subspace of current transmission. Due to this fact, the alignment is not perfect for current transmission and causes leakage interference in the desired signal space. However, we show that with the help of proper receiver design, we can minimize this leakage interference and get substantial gains. We also consider the practical limitations of the current receivers and provide a modified solution to overcome these limits. With the help of extensive system level simulations we compare our scheme with other baseline MU-MIMO transmit precoding schemes in terms of mean user rates. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides considerable gains over the baseline transmission schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outdated interference alignment based transmit precoding for MU-MIMO","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335511/6347558/06347596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Outdated interference alignment based transmit precoding for MU-MIMO","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347596/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116910","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outdated interference alignment based transmit precoding for MU-MIMO","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569633105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048222S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335511","isNumber":"6347558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6347558","articleId":"6347596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347626,"authors":[{"name":"Filipe D.

To cope with this, operators are deploying small base station sites to cover hot spots. However, this also increases the total network energy expenditure and carbon footprint. As a consequence, improving the energy efficiency of small base stations remains a hot topic. In this paper energy efficient transmission in LTE pico-cell environments is addressed aiming at providing a basis for LTE networks optimization and carbon footprint reduction. MIMO is studied from an energy efficiency point of view rather than from an increased datarates perspective as usually found in literature. Additionally, duty-cycling in time and frequency is also considered, hence, improving the amount of power reduction that can be achieved. Globally, a factor of twelve times variation between the worst-case power consumption and the optimally selected MIMO mode is observed in pico-cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335511/6347558/06347626.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO strategies for energy efficient transmission in LTE pico-cell environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Power demand","Signal to noise ratio","Gain","Energy efficiency","Throughput","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","environmental factors","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","picocellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO","energy efficient transmission","LTE pico-cell environments","mobile data traffic","LTE networks optimization","carbon footprint reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"MIMO strategies for energy efficient transmission in LTE pico-cell environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347626/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116940","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO strategies for energy efficient transmission in LTE pico-cell environments","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569638565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036179S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335511","isNumber":"6347558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6347558","articleId":"6347626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347639,"authors":[{"name":"Gauraw Kumar Srivastava","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Telematics, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Gauraw Kumar","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"38508762800"},{"name":"Naresh Kumar Tadkapalli","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Telematics, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Naresh Kumar","lastName":"Tadkapalli","id":"38503400600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-036-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2710-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347639","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":602},"abstract":"To achieve higher data rate as specified in LTE-Advanced, support of wider Bandwidths are required than the existing 20 MHz system bands. Carrier Aggregation is the technique deployed in LTE-A system that can extends system bandwidth up to 100 MHz which also increases the downlink spectral efficiency. N-x-OFDMA will be used as the downlink transmission scheme in LTE-A. The primary concern in carrier aggregation is the significant increase in PAPR of the time domain signal, to accommodate large peaks PA has to operate with sufficient power back-off which results in lower operating efficiency. We propose two stages of Noise Shaping process for reducing the PAPR of the carrier aggregated composite signal which is a transmitter- side processing technique and does not require any information at the receiver. This paper analyzes different PAPR scenarios using contiguous & non-contiguous frequency bands for carrier aggregation and the simulation result shows the performance improvement in PAPR of about 3 & 4dB respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335511/6347558/06347639.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crest factor reduction for carrier aggregated OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Noise shaping","Noise","Bandwidth","Time domain analysis","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crest factor reduction","carrier aggregated OFDM systems","higher data rate","LTE-Advanced","carrier aggregation","LTE-A system","downlink spectral efficiency","N-x-OFDMA","downlink transmission scheme","time domain signal","noise shaping process","carrier aggregated composite signal","transmitter-side processing technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier Aggregation","Noise Shaping process","Peak-to-average power ratio","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Crest factor reduction for carrier aggregated OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347639/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116953","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crest factor reduction for carrier aggregated OFDM systems","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569639237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069115S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335511","isNumber":"6347558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335511","xplore-issue":"6347558","articleId":"6347639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347643,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Khasawneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Khasawneh","id":"38474128500"},{"name":"Anjali Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273300400"},{"name":"Nishith Goel","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Nishith","lastName":"Goel","id":"37338474800"},{"name":"Marzia Zaman","affiliation":["Cistel Technology, Inc., Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Marzia","lastName":"Zaman","id":"37549617700"},{"name":"Saed Alrabaee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Saed","lastName":"Alrabaee","id":"38473965000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-036-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2710-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347643","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Cognitive radio","Power control","Interference","Sensors","Data communication","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","profitability","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic approach","power trading","cognitive radio systems","unlicensed users","frequency bands","CR networks","spectrum trading","noncooperative game theoretic model","high profit gain","unused frequency channels","data transmission","Nash equilibrium","quality of service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Game theory","Spectrum trading","Nash equilibrium (NE)"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) has been introduced to accommodate the steady increment in the spectrum demand. In CR networks, unlicensed users, which are referred to as secondary users (SUs), are allowed to dynamically access the frequency bands when licensed users which are referred to as primary users (PUs) are inactive. One of the most important issues in CR networks is how to share the spectrum effectively among the different users which is denoted as spectrum trading. Spectrum trading aims to satisfy the objectives of both types of users (i.e. PUs and SUs) by balancing these overlapping objectives. In this paper, we propose a noncooperative game theoretic model to allow PUs to gain high profit from renting their unused frequency channels to SUs which use proper power levels over these channels for their data transmission. The proposed model will finally converge to Nash equilibrium (NE) by following the best response dynamics. Choosing the best response strategy by each game player (i.e. PU and SU) based on the perceived opponent strategies is also shown in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed model allows PUs to make extra revenue and satisfy the quality of service (QoS) of SUs.","displayPublicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335511/6347558/06347643.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347558","publicationTitle":"SoftCOM 2012, 20th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A game theoretic approach to power trading in cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"A game theoretic approach to power trading in cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347643/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347643/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116957","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game theoretic approach to power trading in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"1569639995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050169S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335511","isNumber":"6347558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6347558","articleId":"6347643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Split","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6347651,"authors":[{"name":"Nik\u0161a Anti\u0161i\u0107","affiliation":["Siemens d. d., Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Nik\u0161a","lastName":"Anti\u0161i\u0107","id":"37087442913"},{"name":"Mirjana Bonkovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Mirjana","lastName":"Bonkovi\u0107","id":"38094225100"},{"name":"Barbara D\u017eaja","affiliation":["Department for applied sciences, University of Split, Croatia"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"D\u017eaja","id":"37086241886"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-036-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2710-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-290-935-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347651","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Biological neural networks","Noise","Detectors","Nonhomogeneous media","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","gradient methods","neural nets","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detector","robotic control systems","object segmentation","extraction segmentation","gradient detectors","zero crossing detectors","feedforward multilayer back propagation neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347651","abstract":"Detection of edges in the image is extremely important task for many of today's robotic control systems.

The latter is coupled to a three-phase PM-brushless electric generator, whose armature is controlled by an active front-end [12,14]. The ICE is derived from a widespread Diesel unit, which has been properly modified; it is chosen among many other engines as a reliable, very high efficiency, cost effective unit [6], suitable for energy conversion systems (such as residential or commercial applications). The paper starts by defining the criterion which led to the adoption of a high brake mean pressure, in order to produce the above mentioned electric power. After the description of the solutions adopted to optimize the ICE operation performance, a very simple and efficacious control strategy of the generator+converter set is presented. This technique is able to conveniently reduce the magnitude of shaft-torque ripple produced by a high brake mean pressure (and consequently cycle peak pressure), in order to reduce vibrations, noise and rotating speed oscillations. The control is based on assigned curves of ICE torque vs. shaft angular position. Some considerations are also made to define the right generator sizing, in order to allow an efficacious damping action, maintaining good efficiency levels of the generator+converter set. The effectiveness of the control is validated by a series of numerical results in significant operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6347737/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135554","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Torque-oscillations damping in micro-cogeneration units with high brake mean pressure engines and PM-brushless generators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque-oscillations damping in micro-cogeneration units with high brake mean pressure engines and PM-brushless generators","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"p121capaldi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064313S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331299","isNumber":"6347695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331299","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6347695","articleId":"6347737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6347753,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Grandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Grandi","id":"37271561600"},{"name":"Jelena Loncarski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Loncarski","id":"38466611600"},{"name":"Roland Seebacher","affiliation":["Technical University of Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Seebacher","id":"37542000500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1454-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1453-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1452-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347753","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":858},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of current ripple on dead-time distortion in three-phase voltage source inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Harmonic analysis","Switches","Pulse width modulation","Poles and zeros","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","harmonic analysis","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current ripple effect","three-phase voltage source inverters","inverter dead-time distortion","three-phase PWM voltage source inverters","multiphase inverters","multiphase drives","sinusoidal output currents","single zero-crossing","carrier-based PWM techniques","dead-time compensation technique","harmonic spectrum","low-order harmonics","current ripple amplitude","harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switch dead-time","zero crossing","current ripple","harmonic analysis","inverter nonlinearity"]}],"abstract":"Inverter dead-time distortion in output voltages have been widely investigated in the past for three-phase PWM voltage source inverters. Also, there have been some studies about multi-phase inverters with reference to multi-phase drives. Usually, almost sinusoidal output currents are considered, with a single zero crossing for every half fundamental period. High output current ripple introduces multiple zero crossing, leading to modified output voltage distortions. In this paper the effect of the output current ripple has been taken into account, in the case of carrier-based PWM techniques when no any dead-time compensation technique is applied. In particular, the harmonic spectrum of the output voltage distortion has been evaluated on the basis of the multiple zero crossing time interval of output currents. In case of relevant current ripple it is verified a relevant deviation of output voltage harmonics in comparison to the case of almost sinusoidal currents. Theoretical analysis has shown that particular low-order harmonics are affected by the current ripple amplitude, and simulation results confirm the developed analytical approach.","doi":"10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6347753","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331299/6347695/06347753.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6347753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Effects of current ripple on dead-time distortion in three-phase voltage source inverters","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347753/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135570","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347753/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of current ripple on dead-time distortion in three-phase voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"p207grandi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046057S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331299","isNumber":"6347695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331299","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6347695","articleId":"6347753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6347758,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Burgio","affiliation":["Computer and system Electronic Engineering, Computer and Systems Science Department, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Burgio","id":"37271608500"},{"name":"Daniele Menniti","affiliation":["Electronic, Computer and Systems Science Department, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Menniti","id":"37271821500"},{"name":"Giovanni Brusco","affiliation":["Electronic, Computer and Systems Science Department, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Brusco","id":"37590359300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1454-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1453-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1452-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347758","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Active filters","Damping","Voltage measurement","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","damping","power distribution lines","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active resonance dampers","active power filters","power distribution lines","harmonic resonance","characteristic impedance","Simplorer simulation software","fundamental frequency","power losses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Power Filter","Active Resonance Damper","Harmonic voltage compensator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347758","doi":"10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6347758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6347758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347695","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331299/6347695/06347758.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of two active resonance dampers","abstract":"In this paper two active power filters used for the resonance damping in power distribution lines are compared.

The estimation qualities of the considered estimators are compared within three numerical examples covering a different kind of uncertainty in the model description.","doi":"10.1109/MMAR.2012.6347879","startPage":"250","endPage":"255","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 17th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6338446/6347808/06347879.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 17th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMAR.2012.6347879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in local state estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","State estimation","Mathematical model","Approximation methods","Noise","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","nonlinear functions","parameter estimation","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","local state estimation","system dynamics","nonlinear function","system state","NN unknown parameter estimation","estimation qualities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6347879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in local state estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6347879/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in local state estimation","confLoc":"Miedzyzdroje, Poland","sourcePdf":"A5LC021061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073149S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6338446","isNumber":"6347808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6338446","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6347808","articleId":"6347879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6347889,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Luzar","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona Gora, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Luzar","id":"38497134500"},{"name":"Andrzej Czajkowski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona Gora, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Czajkowski","id":"37089051547"},{"name":"Marcin Witczak","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona Gora, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Witczak","id":"37547177300"},{"name":"J\u00f3zef Korbicz","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona Gora, Poland"],"firstName":"J\u00f3zef","lastName":"Korbicz","id":"37353225000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2124-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2121-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2123-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6347889","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Actuators","Biological neural networks","Fault detection","Sensor systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","control engineering computing","fault diagnosis","feedforward neural nets","parameter estimation","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuator","sensors fault diagnosis","dynamic neural network","state-space neural network","sensor fault detection","sensor fault localization","system model","neural network modeling","artificial feedforward neural network","dynamic neurons","state-space representation","neural network parameter estimation","adaptive random search algorithm","system input estimator","input residual","output residual","fault isolation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6347889","abstract":"In this paper, the actuators and sensors fault detection and localization using a system model is considered.

The cavity walls are made either lossy or losses, and hence the effects of losses are examined by comparing the two cases. It is found when the system is lossless, it is possible to continuously raise its effective DOF number by packing more and more antennas in fixed communication volumes, and this can be done to an extent that is far greater than allowed in the lossy system case. Additionally, the performance improvement of multi-polarized MIMO systems over similar uni-polarized ones are also investigated. Unlike the polarization gain suggested by an existing research, the results from this work show that the practically obtainable benefits from the EM polarizations are actually higher, and also vary with the system operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348080","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOF of indoor MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DOF of indoor MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348080/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134902","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6348080/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOF of indoor MIMO systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"IF51p7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029598S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6348081,"authors":[{"name":"Dalin Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Dalin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38504722300"},{"name":"Toshikazu Hori","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshikazu","lastName":"Hori","id":"37275406600"},{"name":"Mitoshi Fujimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Fukui, Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitoshi","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37284332500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348081","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metals","Wires","Channel capacity","MIMO","Antenna radiation patterns","Transmitters","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","dipole antenna arrays","MIMO communication","wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metal wire","near field MIMO system","dual dipole arrays","half power beamwidth","element radiation pattern","system channel capacity","maximum channel capacity"]}],"abstract":"This paper clarifies the effect of the metal wire on the channel capacity in the near-field MIMO system.

While the optimal voltage quality of the nearest level switching is obtained for both of them, natural voltage balancing dynamic properties are essentially different. It is shown that a flying capacitor H-bridge converter with appropriate phase-shifted carrier-based PWM delivers much faster natural voltage balancing dynamics, especially, for small DC voltage commands and AC modulation indices. Along with reduced parts (diodes) count, this gives a three-level H-bridge flying capacitor converter a competitive advantage over other three-level H-bridge converter topologies with natural balancing.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6348254","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331299/6347695/06348254.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doi":"10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6348254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of natural voltage balancing in three-level H-bridge capacitor- and diode-clamped converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of natural voltage balancing in three-level H-bridge capacitor- and diode-clamped converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6348254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13135673","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of natural voltage balancing in three-level H-bridge capacitor- and diode-clamped converters","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"p76ruderman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070795S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331299","isNumber":"6347695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331299","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6347695","articleId":"6348254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6348257,"authors":[{"name":"Rabah Benabid","affiliation":["Electrical & Industrial Systems Laboratory-LSEI, University of Sciences & Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Rabah","lastName":"Benabid","id":"38195883800"},{"name":"Mohamed Boudour","affiliation":["Electrical & Industrial Systems Laboratory-LSEI, University of Sciences & Technology Houari Boumediene, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Boudour","id":"37299921400"},{"name":"Alberto Berizzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Berizzi","id":"37272346700"},{"name":"Cristian Bovo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Bovo","id":"37272383900"},{"name":"Valentin Ilea","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Energia, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Ilea","id":"37403690200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1454-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1453-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1452-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6348257","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348257","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Static VAr compensators","Optimization","Voltage control","Generators","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","flexible AC transmission systems","genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation","reactive power","static VAr compensators","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","static var compensator","secondary voltage regulation","NSGA-II","hierarchical voltage regulation","HVR","SVR","FACTS devices","SVC","nondominated sorting genetic algorithms II","reactive power","decision maker","Pareto set","Italian power system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","Fuzzy logic","Secondary voltage regulation","Genetics algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6348257","pdfPath":"/iel5/6331299/6347695/06348257.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition (ENERGYCON)","startPage":"783","endPage":"788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EnergyCon.2012.6348257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of Static var Compensator in the Presence of Secondary Voltage Regulation using NSGA-II","abstract":"The Hierarchical Voltage Regulation (HVR) is an efficient alternative to the traditional solutions used in the power system voltage control. It consists of three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary, among which the Secondary Voltage Regulation (SVR) level is the core of the HVR ensuring the coordination of a network area reactive power resources by controlling the voltage of the pilot bus, the area most representative bus. Moreover, in the recent years, the shunt FACTS devices, especially the Static var Compensators (SVC), have shown very good performances in local voltage control at a reasonable cost. Therefore, including these devices in the HVR scheme has become an important task. In this paper, the application of a multi-objective optimization to find the optimal placement of SVCs in the SVR environment is proposed; the objective functions to be minimized are the total power losses and the reactive power generated in the power system. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II (NSGA-II) is used to generate the Pareto front which contains several optimal solutions and will be used by the Decision Maker (DM) to choose the best compromise solution. In this work, a fuzzy-based mechanism is proposed to select the best compromise solution from the Pareto set. Tests and simulations are performed on a model of the Italian power system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348257/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13135676","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348257/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of Static var Compensator in the Presence of Secondary Voltage Regulation using NSGA-II","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of Static var Compensator in the Presence of Secondary Voltage Regulation using NSGA-II","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"p783benabid.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091768S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6331299","isNumber":"6347695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6331299","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6347695","articleId":"6348257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6348305,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37279309600"},{"name":"Pietro R.

Based on the mathematical model of the UAV, the dynamic equation of the angle of attach is used for the estimation of the value of the airspeed. Two methodologies are here proposed. The first approach (model-based method) assumes a perfect knowledge of the aircraft; in other words, all the geometric and inertial parameters as well as the aerodynamic coefficients are assumed to be known and correct. In the second approach the parameters governing the equation are instead identified via LS optimization from a batch of simulated flight data. Assuming the availability of the measurement of the whole state vector except the airspeed (V), the angle of attack equation results quadratic in V and thus can be easily solved on-line to provide a real-time estimation of the airspeed. The effectiveness of he proposed estimators was validated within a sensor failure detection scheme where the airspeed estimation is employed to generate the diagnostic signal for detecting possible additive faults on the airspeed sensor. A `cusum' detector was employed to detect the occurrence of the failure. The performance of the proposed methodology have been evaluated through a simulation study carried out on a nonlinear dynamical model of the WVU YF-22 aircraft.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Workshop on Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems (EESMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6340509/6348391/06348401.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Workshop on Environmental Energy and Structural Monitoring Systems (EESMS)","doi":"10.1109/EESMS.2012.6348401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EESMS.2012.6348401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6348391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based approaches for the airspeed estimation and fault monitoring of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Estimation","Atmospheric modeling","Equations","Aerodynamics","Aircraft","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","autonomous aerial vehicles","fault diagnosis","mathematical analysis","monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airspeed estimation","fault monitoring","unmanned aerial vehicle","diagnostic system","additive fault detection","airspeed sensor","remotely controlled semiscale YF-22 monitoring aircraft","mathematical model","UAV","dynamic equation","aerodynamic coefficients","simulated flight data","real time estimation","sensor failure detection","diagnostic signal","cusum detector","nonlinear dynamical model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor fault diagnosis","airspeed sensor","nonlinear model","CUSUM detector","reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Model-based approaches for the airspeed estimation and fault monitoring of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13118158","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based approaches for the airspeed estimation and fault monitoring of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569635309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060307S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6340509","isNumber":"6348391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6340509","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6348391","articleId":"6348401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6348414,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Tomura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Tomura","id":"37961255400"},{"name":"Jiro Hirokawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiro","lastName":"Hirokawa","id":"37280655700"},{"name":"Takuichi Hirano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Department of International Development Eng, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuichi","lastName":"Hirano","id":"37265406000"},{"name":"Makoto Ando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ando","id":"37280656900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348414","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"abstract":"We apply hybrid MoM/FEM to an X-shaped cavity-backed slot 2\u00d72-element array.

A MIMO handheld device with the proposed wave-guiding structure, constructed of metal patch or photovoltaic panel, can effectively reduce its SAR value. The radiation efficiency and frequency response are affected slightly when the proposed structure is presented. Thus the wave-guiding structure with thin profile can be easily integrated with mobile phone or as an add-on protecting case without modifying the existing antennas. Two types of wave-guiding structures for 2.6 GHz WiMAX MIMO handheld device are constructed and measured. The simulated and the measured results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed SAR-reducing structure.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348486.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel SAR-reducing add-on cover for MIMO handheld device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6348486/","displayDocTitle":"Novel SAR-reducing add-on cover for MIMO handheld device","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13145830","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel SAR-reducing add-on cover for MIMO handheld device","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s505p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04016S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6348489,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

With half-duplex radios, spectrum sensing has to be performed periodically between transmissions, leading to spectral inefficiencies. In this paper, we study the achievable rate gain and transmission range increase for in-band full-duplex transmissions using directional multi-reconfigurable antennas. The aim is to enable simultaneous transmission and sensing in cognitive radio networks.

As such, they illuminate a narrow slice of an object to be imaged. With only this slice illuminated, the scattered field will only be due to this narrow portion of the object, allowing for computationally simple inversion of a one-dimensional contour rather than an entire two-dimensional surface.

But for the 60 GHz market to flourish not only low cost RFICs are required, low cost antennas and packages are also key points. So far, HTCC technology has been seen as the chosen one when targeting millimeter wave (MMW) applications. But since 60 GHz applications are targeting large volume consumer applications, the pressure on the cost of the packaging will become higher and it is highly desirable to explore alternative lower cost solutions than HTCC. In this paper, we present 60GHz integrated antennas in an innovative low cost High Density Interconnect (HDI) organic technology demonstrating promising high-gain antenna solution (>; 7 dBi).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13135314","htmlLink":"/document/6348633/","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"HDI organic technology integrating built-in antennas dedicated to 60 GHz SiP solution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HDI organic technology integrating built-in antennas dedicated to 60 GHz SiP solution","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s413p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060657S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6348661,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.

The results show that the proposed antenna demonstrates an impedance bandwidth of 50 MHz (S11 <;-10 dB), and a polarization bandwidth of 44.3 MHz (axial ratio <; 3 dB). Also, the axial ratio is obtained in a broad angular range when the antenna is in LHCP and RHCP mode.

In this paper we present the recent developments on the antenna concept and report on the first measured performance at uniform incoming power distribution, figures and correlations between different measurement labs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and verification of MIMO 2\u00d72 reference antennas","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348702","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348702.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design and verification of MIMO 2\u00d72 reference antennas","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348702/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and verification of MIMO 2\u00d72 reference antennas","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s404p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05208S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6348703,"authors":[{"name":"Ibra Dioum","affiliation":["University of Cheikh Anta Diop, LIRT, Dakar, Senegal"],"firstName":"Ibra","lastName":"Dioum","id":"37601592000"},{"name":"Sidi Mouhamed Farssi","affiliation":["University of Cheikh Anta Diop, LIRT, Dakar, Senegal"],"firstName":"Sidi Mouhamed","lastName":"Farssi","id":"37086509942"},{"name":"Aliou Diallo","affiliation":["Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azu, FR"],"firstName":"Aliou","lastName":"Diallo"},{"name":"Cyril Luxey","affiliation":["University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, LEAT-IM2NP, Nice, France"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Luxey","id":"37284039900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348703","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":251},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Telephone sets","Channel models","Correlation","Antenna arrays","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO performance evaluation","LTE handsets","MIMO antenna structure evaluation","scattering parameters","channel capacity","block error rate","Agilent SystemVue software"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present the design and the evaluation of two MIMO antenna structures for LTE handsets.

The method is demonstrated by means of a time domain simulation of a microgear resonator to determine its resonant frequencies.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348745.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid 2D/3D cylindrical FDTD method based on azimuthal mode decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Resonant frequency","Materials","Discrete Fourier transforms","Probes","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid 2D-3D cylindrical FDTD method","azimuthal mode decomposition","cylindrical meshes","three dimensional cylindrical grid","azimuthal inhomogeneous regions","z-axis","multimodal two dimensional grid","time domain simulation","microgear resonator","resonant frequencies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid 2D/3D cylindrical FDTD method based on azimuthal mode decomposition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348745/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13135003","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid 2D/3D cylindrical FDTD method based on azimuthal mode decomposition","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s362p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04914S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6348749,"authors":[{"name":"Theng Huat Gan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Theng Huat","lastName":"Gan","id":"38242662000"},{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng Leong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37272187200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348749","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"This paper present the analysis for the divergence of electric field for the two-dimensional (2-D) transverse electric (TE) leapfrog alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method.

The simulated results indicate a promising method of using the variation in the reflection coefficient of the antennas to give a quick differentiation between different head strokes, which is a must for any possibility of a patient survival.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stroke detection based on variations in reflection coefficients of wideband antennas","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348795","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Stroke detection based on variations in reflection coefficients of wideband antennas","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348795/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13135052","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stroke detection based on variations in reflection coefficients of wideband antennas","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s356p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061064S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6348803,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Alomar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Waleed","lastName":"Alomar","id":"38348686300"},{"name":"Amir Mortazawi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mortazawi","id":"37268771000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348803","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Delay","Bandwidth","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","antenna arrays","antenna feeds","delay circuits","power dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam squint","uniformly excited serially fed antenna arrays","negative group delay circuits","feed line","amplifier","T-junction power divider","bandwidth 200 MHz","frequency 10 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348803","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348803.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of beam squint in uniformly excited serially fed antenna arrays using negative group delay circuits","abstract":"A new design for a serially fed antenna array employing a negative group delay (NGD) circuit is reported in this paper.

However, in a real case, an outdoor environment consists of many buildings and streets made of heterogeneous materials.

While this methodology is adequate for many applications, it produces a source whose Cartesian oriented field components have slightly different phase centers, which yields a visible propagation delay between these components. For phase sensitive applications, more accurate consideration of the source phase center may be required. In this study, we introduce a means of producing point sources with coincident phase centers. We will show that these sources provide good accuracy at close distances to the phase center while outperforming the standard sources in the near field when an arbitrary direction of the point source moment is required.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348868","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348868.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of point source models with coincident phase centers in a cubic FDTD grid for arbitrary source orientation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348868/","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of point source models with coincident phase centers in a cubic FDTD grid for arbitrary source orientation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13135125","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348868/","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of point source models with coincident phase centers in a cubic FDTD grid for arbitrary source orientation","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s312p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047965S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6348869,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Kang Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering/Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Kang","lastName":"Jeng","id":"37276815800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348869","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"An analytical expression for FDTD solution to the 2-D problem of TM oblique incidence on a dielectric thin film is proposed.

Although TCDAs are low profile, capable of wide bandwidth, good scan performance, and low cross polarization, they require a balanced feeding structure whose realization introduces significant practical challenges. Among them is developing a balun that is both compact and wideband. In this paper, we demonstrate a design for a low cost balun that fits within the existing array volume and increases the overall bandwidth of the array. This is accomplished by exploiting the balun's reactance as part of the matching network for the aperture. The final array delivers 6.3 : 1 bandwidth, \u00b145\u00b0 scanning in all planes, and <; -10dB cross-polarization. These capabilities are believed to be unique for a low profile array with a self-contained feed.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6348918","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06348918.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6348918","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 6.3\u22361 bandwidth scanning Tightly Coupled Dipole Array with co-designed compact balun","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A 6.3\u22361 bandwidth scanning Tightly Coupled Dipole Array with co-designed compact balun","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6348918/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6348918/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13135175","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 6.3\u22361 bandwidth scanning Tightly Coupled Dipole Array with co-designed compact balun","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"s305p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046149S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6348918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6348924,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Lo Monte","affiliation":["Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, University of Dayton Research Institute, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Lo Monte","id":"37391576500"},{"name":"Russell Vela","affiliation":["Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, University of Dayton Research Institute, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Vela","id":"37706618300"},{"name":"LaMar Westbrook","affiliation":["Sensors Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, USA"],"firstName":"LaMar","lastName":"Westbrook","id":"37718955900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6348924","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Bandwidth","Radar tracking","Radio frequency","Receivers","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopulse radar","digital sum-difference beamforming","radar signals","monopulse quadrants","sum and difference patterns","\u03a3/\u0394 patterns","direct digizitazion","signal processing algorithms","digital monopulse processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6348924","abstract":"Classically, radar signals received from the monopulse quadrants are processed analogically to obtain sum (\u03a3) and difference (\u0394) patterns.

Three slits etched into the ground plane are used to reduce the mutual coupling between the conventional phone antenna and the MIMO antenna, moreover, this slits are help to relieve the impedance matching degradation of the conventional phone antenna caused by the mutual coupling. A wideband T-shaped neutralization line without effect on the performance of the conventional phone antenna is applied to improve the isolation for the MIMO antenna, and high isolation is achieved within the wide operation band. For the convention phone antenna, the two operation bands with VSWR \u2264 3 are 0.89-0.96 GHz and 1.71-2.18 GHz, respectively, and nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns in H-plane are achieved. The operation band of the MIMO antenna with VSWR \u2264 1.7 and isolation \u2265 20 dB is 2.4-3.7 GHz, and the two MIMO antenna elements have back-radiation patterns for achieving diversity gain. The simulated and the measured results are in a good agreement.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6349234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06349234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6349234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tri-band antenna with compact conventional phone antenna and wideband MIMO antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tri-band antenna with compact conventional phone antenna and wideband MIMO antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349234/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134323","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6349234/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tri-band antenna with compact conventional phone antenna and wideband MIMO antenna","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"IF11p10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051323S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6349234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349239,"authors":[{"name":"Deukhyeon Ga","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deukhyeon","lastName":"Ga","id":"38234495200"},{"name":"Youngki Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngki","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539811000"},{"name":"Taeho Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Taeho","lastName":"Song","id":"38235547400"},{"name":"Jaehoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0462-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0461-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-0460-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"6349239","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":517},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Inductors","Strips","Mobile antennas","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","inductors","isolation technology","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna fabrication","RFC","LTE mobile application","multiinput multioutput antenna","radiofrequency choke","RF signal suppression","radiating element","VSWR","envelope correlation coefficient","Long Term Evolution","frequency 746 MHz to 787 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO antenna","RF Choke","Isolation","LTE"]}],"abstract":"Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) antenna with improved isolation using radio frequency choke (RFC) is proposed.

In particular, Multiple- Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have been explored as a method of increasing the capacity of line-of-sight links, as an attractive alternative to fiber-based wired backhaul. A key limiting factor for conventional mm-wave MIMO has been achieving optimal performance, which requires a critically-spaced antenna array and high transceiver complexity. Efforts to reduce the complexity, e.g. with a few widely spaced antennas, lead to significantly decreased performance. Continuous Aperture Phased MIMO (CAP-MIMO) is a hybrid digital-analog transceiver architecture that uses a high-resolution Discrete Lens Array (DLA) for analog spatial beamforming. The DLA enables direct access to the communicating modes, resulting in an optimal MIMO system with dramatically low transceiver complexity. This paper discusses the design, fabrication, and analysis of a prototype DLA-based CAP-MIMO system, using both analytical and measurement results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6337029/6347935/06349292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/APS.2012.6349292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2012.6349292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete lens array modeling and design for optimum MIMO communications at mm-wave","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Arrays","Complexity theory","Lenses","Apertures","Prototypes","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture antennas","array signal processing","computational complexity","lens antennas","millimetre wave antenna arrays","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete lens array modeling","optimum MIMO communications","millimeter-wave wireless systems","mm-wave MIMO wireless systems","communications network capacity requirement","multiple-input multiple-output systems","line-of-sight links","critically-spaced antenna array","transceiver complexity","complexity reduction","widely-spaced antennas","continuous aperture-phased MIMO","hybrid digital-analog transceiver architecture","high-resolution DLA","DLA-based CAP-MIMO system","communicating modes","analog spatial beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-14 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Discrete lens array modeling and design for optimum MIMO communications at mm-wave","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349292/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13134377","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"8-14 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete lens array modeling and design for optimum MIMO communications at mm-wave","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"IF41p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060275S","chronDate":"8-14 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6337029","isNumber":"6347935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6337029","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6347935","articleId":"6349292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349293,"authors":[{"name":"Farid Jolani","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Dept.

They are also based on a fifth-degree representation, and may be extended to higher degrees of nonlinearities in the RF PA block, enabling IMD analysis of envelope feedback amplifiers at low power. The approach proposed in this paper circumvents the difficulty of measuring error signals during closed-loop operation for troubleshooting purposes. This approach is also very useful for computer-aided test setups intended for development work independent of the often idealized circuit simulation environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6349429/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116198","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Formulations and a Computer-Aided Test Method for the Estimation of IMD Levels in an Envelope Feedback RFIC Power Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formulations and a Computer-Aided Test Method for the Estimation of IMD Levels in an Envelope Feedback RFIC Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tcad-constantin-2207954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084281S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6349425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6349425","articleId":"6349429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6349430,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto A.

Therefore, their performance and other parameters, such as area and power consumption, are highly dependent on the adders' features. In this paper, we present multispeculation as a way of increasing adders' performance with a low area penalty. In our proposed design, dividing an adder into several fragments and predicting the carry-in of each fragment enables computing every addition in two very short cycles at the most, with 99% or higher probability. Furthermore, based on multispeculation principles, we propose a new strategy for implementing addition chains and hiding most of the penalty cycles due to mispredictions, while keeping at the same time the resource sharing capabilities that are sought in high-level synthesis. Our results show that it is possible to build linear and logarithmic adders more than 4.7\u00d7 and 1.7\u00d7 faster than the nonspeculative case, respectively. Moreover, this is achieved with a low area penalty (38% for linear adders) or even an area reduction (-8% for logarithmic adders). Finally, applying multispeculation principles to signal processing benchmarks that use addition chains will result in 25% execution time reduction, with an additional 3% decrease in datapath area with respect to implementations with logarithmic fast adders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349430/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13116199","volume":"31","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multispeculative Addition Applied to Datapath Synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multispeculative Addition Applied to Datapath Synthesis","sourcePdf":"tcad-garcia-2208966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10973S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6349425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6349425","articleId":"6349430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349438,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Janicki","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6349425/6349438/6349438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jakub Janicki received the M.S. degree in telecommunications from the Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications.","His current research interests include design for testability, testing of system-on-a-chip designs, low power embedded test, and test compression.

The proposed MQSFL algorithm applies the theory of membrane computing and quantum computing to the shuffled frog leaping algorithm, which is an effective discrete optimization algorithm. Then the proposed MQSFL algorithm is used to solve the spectrum allocation problem of cognitive radio systems. By hybridizing the quantum frog colony optimization and membrane computing, the quantum state and observation state of the quantum frogs can be well evolved within the membrane structure. The novel spectrum allocation algorithm can search the global optimal solution within a reasonable computation time. Simulation results for three utility functions of a cognitive radio system are provided to show that the MQSFL spectrum allocation method is superior to some previous spectrum allocation algorithms based on intelligence computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2012","volume":"23","issue":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Membrane-inspired quantum shuffled frog leaping algorithm for spectrum allocation","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Membrane-inspired quantum shuffled frog leaping algorithm for spectrum allocation","sourcePdf":"679688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013026S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6349440","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6349450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6349524,"authors":[{"name":"Uday Moghe","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Uday","lastName":"Moghe","id":"38504203700"},{"name":"Prashant Lakkadwala","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Lakkadwala","id":"38497130700"},{"name":"Durgesh Kumar Mishra","affiliation":["Sri Aurobindo Institute of Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Durgesh Kumar","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37285562700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2177-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2174-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2175-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2176-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6349524","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1160},"abstract":"The Cloud computing which performs the task of the computing and storage capacity for a service to provide the flexibility for users.

These show that there is considerable potential to optimize both the illumination levels (and hence the received signal to noise ratio for communications) and that sufficient bandwidth is available (when considering that of the OLED) for communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible light communication using OLEDs: Illumination and channel modeling","publicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349685","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335568/6349673/06349685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Visible light communication using OLEDs: Illumination and channel modeling","conferenceDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349685/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13116988","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible light communication using OLEDs: Illumination and channel modeling","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"S0203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065932S","chronDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335568","isNumber":"6349673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335568","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6349673","articleId":"6349685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6349687,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Under the luminaire-as-transmitter model, wireless communication is achieved by modulating LED(s) that must simultaneously meet the illumination mission. Illumination requirements include maintaining energy efficiency, constant color and intensity control whereas communications requirements are speed and BER goals. In this paper we explore the perceptual qualities of visible light from LED luminaires to render color. We then propose a novel modulation scheme for visible light communications which can maintain constant perceived ambient lighting. By using D>;3 LEDs, multiple lighting states that are indistinguishable to humans but are distinguishable to an electronic receiver can be achieved. Changes between these states are detected as intensity modulation in different wavelength bands.","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349697","publicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335568/6349673/06349697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349673","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metameric modulation for diffuse visible light communications with constant ambient lighting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Metameric modulation for diffuse visible light communications with constant ambient lighting","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117000","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6349697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metameric modulation for diffuse visible light communications with constant ambient lighting","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"S0403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051533S","chronDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335568","isNumber":"6349673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335568","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6349673","articleId":"6349697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349698,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Biagi","affiliation":["Department of Information, Electronics and Telecommunication, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Biagi","id":"37275283000"},{"name":"Anna Maria Vegni","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Vegni","id":"37586937800"},{"name":"Thomas D.C.

Finally, we consider also how different users can access the Internet by means of a TDMA-like access scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335568/6349673/06349698.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2012 International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2012.6349698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LAT indoor MIMO-VLC \u2014 Localize, access and transmit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Bit error rate","MIMO","Lighting","Educational institutions","Photodiodes","Reflectivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Internet","MIMO communication","optical communication","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LAT indoor MIMO-VLC","localize","transmit","visible light communications","visible spectrum","high-speed data communications","localization services","high data rate services","transmission","communication system","BER","Internet","TDMA-like access scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible Light Communications","MIMO","localization","TDMA","luminaires","wireless access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","displayDocTitle":"LAT indoor MIMO-VLC \u2014 Localize, access and transmit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349698/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117001","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LAT indoor MIMO-VLC \u2014 Localize, access and transmit","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"S0404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035974S","chronDate":"22-22 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335568","isNumber":"6349673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335568","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6349673","articleId":"6349698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6349716,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Salamanca","affiliation":["Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y Comunicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Salamanca","id":"38275160000"},{"name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 Murillo-Fuentes","affiliation":["Teor\u00eda de la Se\u00f1al y Comunicaciones, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Murillo-Fuentes","id":"38272011400"},{"name":"Pablo M.

By imposing a tree-like approximation over the graphical model of the code, this algorithm introduces pairwise marginal constraints over pairs of variables, which provide joint information of the variables related. Thanks to this, the proposed TEP decoder improves the performance of the standard belief propagation (BP) solution. An efficient way of constructing the tree-like structure is also described. The simulation results illustrate the TEP decoder gain in the finite-length regime, compared to the standard BP solution. For code lengths shorter than n = 512, the gain in the waterfall region achieves up to 0.25 dB. We also notice a remarkable reduction of the error floor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree-structured expectation propagation for LDPC decoding over the AWGN channel","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349716","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335571/6349703/06349716.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Tree-structured expectation propagation for LDPC decoding over the AWGN channel","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349716/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117151","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree-structured expectation propagation for LDPC decoding over the AWGN channel","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"final111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066622S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335571","isNumber":"6349703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335571","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6349703","articleId":"6349716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349734,"authors":[{"name":"Seniha Esen Yuksel","affiliation":["Middle East Technical University, Mersin, Turkey","Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Seniha Esen","lastName":"Yuksel","id":"37862331200"},{"name":"Jeremy Bolton","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Bolton","id":"37265756500"},{"name":"Paul D.

Since the features which will best identify the anomalies are a priori unknown, several common detection strategies are: 1) evaluating atypicality of a sample (its p-value) based on the null distribution defined on the full N-dimensional feature space; 2) considering a (combinatoric) set of low order distributions, e.g. all singletons and all feature pairs, with detections made based on the smallest p-value yielded over all such low order tests. The first approach relies on accurate estimation of the joint distribution, while the second may suffer from increased false alarm rates as N and T grow. Alternatively, inspired by greedy feature selection commonly used in supervised learning, we propose a novel sequential anomaly detection procedure with a growing number of tests. Here, new tests are (greedily) included only when they are needed, i.e., when their use (on currently undetected samples) will yield greater aggregate statistical significance of (multiple testing corrected) detections than obtainable using the existing test cadre. Our approach thus aims to maximize aggregate statistical significance of all detections made up until a finite horizon. Our method is evaluated, along with supervised methods, for a network intrusion domain, detecting Zeus bot (intrusion) packet flows embedded amongst (normal)Web flows. It is shown that judicious feature representation is essential for discriminating Zeus from Web.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential anomaly detection in a batch with growing number of tests: Application to network intrusion detection","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349793","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6335571/6349703/06349793.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349703","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6349793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sequential anomaly detection in a batch with growing number of tests: Application to network intrusion detection","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349793/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13117228","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential anomaly detection in a batch with growing number of tests: Application to network intrusion detection","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"final7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073957S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6335571","isNumber":"6349703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6335571","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6349703","articleId":"6349793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6349811,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Singh","affiliation":["Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Singh","id":"37653408500"},{"name":"Narendra Ahuja","affiliation":["Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Narendra","lastName":"Ahuja","id":"37275975300"},{"name":"Pierre Moulin","affiliation":["Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Moulin","id":"37284080100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1026-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1024-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1025-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1551-2541"}],"articleNumber":"6349811","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Training","Approximation algorithms","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","least mean squares methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learning","growing sum problem","online kernel algorithm","computational drawback","computational complexity","signal processing","kernel evaluation approximation","finite dimensional inner product","randomized feature space","kernel least mean square algorithm","nonlinear extension"]}],"abstract":"Online kernel algorithms have an important computational drawback.

The optimization is executed 50 times in order to study convergence and to perform a statistical study on dimensioning parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349870","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06349870.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic design optimization of a low speed Slotted Switched Reluctance Machine using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic design optimization of a low speed Slotted Switched Reluctance Machine using genetic algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349870/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13119191","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic design optimization of a low speed Slotted Switched Reluctance Machine using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"0233ff005681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07218S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6349870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6349876,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When oversized, most of these motors operate with low efficiency. The objective of this paper is to develop a unique design for a three phase, multi-flux, stator winding SCIM to improve the efficiency. Adjustable flux motors with multiple winding connections can be an energy efficient solution in variable and fixed load applications, improving the efficiency by means of properly adapting motor flux to the actual load. In this paper, a design optimization method is proposed. The optimal design of multiconnection, multiflux stator winding to improve motor efficiency in a wide load range is proposed using Genetic Algorithm (GA). This algorithm is a population-based search algorithm characterized as conceptually simple, easy to implement and computationally efficient. A parameter-less loss approach is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to handle the constraints effectively. A comparison of the final optimum designs with the existing design for a 7.5-kW motor is presented, demonstrating that the optimal designs produce larger efficiency in all load range. The importance of this work is highlighted by the recent concerns about the need to achieve energy savings in industry.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349879","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06349879.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based design optimization of a three-phase multiflux Induction Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349879/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based design optimization of a three-phase multiflux Induction Motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349879/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119200","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based design optimization of a three-phase multiflux Induction Motor","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"0288ff009911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063574S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6349879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6349888,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Petrini\u0107","affiliation":["KON\u010cAR-Electrical Engineering Institute, inc., Zagreb, Croatia"],"bio":{"p":["Miroslav Petrini\u0107 was born in Zagreb, Croatia, on November 13. 1983.

The second objective deals with the sensorless detection of the rotor position. A technique based on the high-frequency signal injection is considered. The IPM motor has to keep the capability to be sensorless detected when it works at any load. In particular, such a capability has to be verified along the trajectory of the Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA), that is, the rotor has to exhibit a proper differential saliency (typically not lower than two) along all the MTPA trajectory, including overload operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349894","startPage":"378","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6349894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6349821","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 XXth International Conference on Electrical Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/6330482/6349821/06349894.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of an Interior PM motor for a high-performance drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349894/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of an Interior PM motor for a high-performance drive","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349894/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119214","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of an Interior PM motor for a high-performance drive","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"0378ff009393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056592S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6349894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6349923,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This is why marine turbines (MT), are considered to provide onboard energy. These turbines can be used to harness kinetic energy of the water flow related to the ship motion. In this paper we propose to study an unconventional design of such a turbine where the electrical generator is located in the periphery of the blades and where the magnetic gap is water filled. This kind of solution called \u201cRIM DRIVEN\u201d structure allows to increase the compactness and the robustness of the system. Due to the strong interaction of the multi physical phenomena, an electromagnetic model and a thermal model of the PM generator are associated with a hydrodynamic model of the blades and of the water flow in the underwater air gap. These models are used in a global coupled design approach in order to optimize, under constraints, the global efficiency of the system. This solution allows to optimize the system design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6349923/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13119238","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6349923/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2012","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A global approach for the design of a Rim-Driven marine turbine generator for sail boat","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global approach for the design of a Rim-Driven marine turbine generator for sail boat","confLoc":"Marseille, France","sourcePdf":"0549ff005037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070839S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6330482","isNumber":"6349821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6330482","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6349821","articleId":"6349923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6349955,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Fasolo","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Alessandro Fasolo received the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Padova, Italy, in 2006.
