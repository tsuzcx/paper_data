A large single VLSI chip can contain over one billion transistors. The ever-increasing level of integration has enabled higher performance and richer feature sets on a single chip. This has led to the explosive growth of microelectronics industry over last decades. But as the geometry of the transistor is getting smaller and the number of transistors on a single chip grows exponentially, the power management for a state-of-the-art VLSI design has become increasingly important. To maintain the performance trend of the VLSI system as the technology scaling continues, many advanced design techniques, especially in power management, have to be employed in order to achieve a balanced design to meet platform and end-user needs.","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2005.1500005","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE VLSI-TSA International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test, 2005.

This paper discusses the limitations and issues in applying the analytic design equations for designing highly efficient RF class E PAs. The main focus of this work is on the validation of the previously published analytic design equations for optimal class E PAs design, as we implemented the PA designs using both discrete RF transistors and monolithic RF ICs at 300 to 2400 MHz. It is found that these analytic design equations available in the literature for RF class E PAs design largely ignored some important physical factors such as the bias sensitivity for the transistor, the undesired device parasitics at RF frequencies, the finite inductance and the low quality factor of the RF choke and/or tank inductors, the time-varying input impedance, and PA stability, etc. They are therefore in general not adequate for predicting the optimal class E PA performance at RF frequencies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Inductors","High power amplifiers","Transmitters","Energy consumption","Transceivers","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF power amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","transceivers","circuit optimisation","system-on-chip","microwave transistors","network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic design equations","class E power amplifiers","power efficiency","RF transmitter","power consumption","reliability","RF transceiver products","integrated RF SoC","discrete RF transistors","monolithic RF IC","bias sensitivity","amplifier design","300 to 2400 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1500045","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2005.1500045","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE VLSI-TSA International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test, 2005.

In this paper, an efficient CAVLC design is proposed. The main concept is the two-stage block pipelining scheme for parallel processing of two 4/spl times/4-blocks. When one block is processed by the scanning engine to collect the required symbols, its previous block is handled by the coding engine to translate symbols into bitstream. The dual-block-pipelined architecture doubles the throughput and utilization of CAVLC at high bitrates. Moreover, a zero skipping technique is adopted to reduce up to 90% of cycles at low bitrates. Last but not least, exponential-Golomb coding for other general symbols and bitstream encapsulation for network abstraction layer are integrated with CAVLC engine as a complete entropy coder for H.264/AVC baseline profile.

In this paper we present a method based on adaptive neural network filter for compensation of the mismatch errors. This method needs no more special information about the input signal except that it should be band limited to the Nyquist frequency for the whole ADC system. Then the compensation can be working while the ADCs are still running. Here we adopt the genetic algorithm to optimize the initial weight value in the network, this algorithm makes complementary advantages for combining back propagation and genetic algorithms.

One critical step in neural network application is network training, that data in business database or data warehouse would be selected and refined to form training data sets. Traditional neural network applications in patterns prediction are mainly based on the assumption that behaviors of participants are consistent through the time of data. However, in real world, entity behaviors may change greatly. As a result, data in training data set may be time-variant, reflecting different behavior patterns in different time. So it is difficult to predict behavior patterns from old data. For example, it is impossible to discover the stock price pattern by the stock exchange data ten years ago, especially in the developing stock market like China. Therefore when data is time variant, data selection will influence the training result Since traditional neural network model lacks in the ability of processing time-variant data, this paper presents an improved neural network model, Amnestic neural network, which simulates human cognitive behavior of forgetting, to solve the problem of cross-temporal data selection. The effective of Amnestic neural network was tested by the application on stock price prediction experiment in the stock market of China.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1500149/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8580809","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1500149/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Amnestic neural network for classification: application on stock trend prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amnestic neural network for classification: application on stock trend prediction","confLoc":"Chongquing, China","sourcePdf":"01500149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053938S","chronDate":"13-15 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10017","isNumber":"32161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10017","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32161","articleId":"1500149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1500170,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhui Sun","affiliation":["Network management Research Center, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Wenhui Sun","id":"37559115200"},{"name":"Yue Xu","affiliation":["Network management Research Center, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Yue Xu","id":"37557096000"},{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["Network management Research Center, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Feng Liu","id":"37555772700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8971-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-1890"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-1904"}],"articleNumber":"1500170","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["XML","Web and internet services","Contracts","Quality of service","Financial management","Resource management","Communication industry","Monitoring","Intelligent networks","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XML","Internet","electronic commerce","customer services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service level agreements management","Internet services environment","XML schema recommendation","W3C","XML+XML","schema-based SLA","e-business administration","message structure"]}],"abstract":"At present, Internet services environment is administered and managed according to dynamically negotiated service level agreements (SLA) between service providers and customers.

Rigid 2-D/3-D registration of 2-D fluoroscopy images with 3-D CT images can be used for image-guided surgery or intraoperative navigation. X-ray fluoroscopy images provide real-time visualization. However, in general, resolution of fluoroscopy images is limited, these modalities are only 2-D and features in the front of body overlap one. Because of its drawback, three-dimensional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are broadly used in clinical diagnostics and treatment planning [1], These have the spatial information and high resolution, but at present their use as interventional imaging modalities has been limited. In this paper, to utilize CT information during interventional procedures, a preoperative CT scan is aligned with an intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopy image. In preprocessing procedure we generate CT-derived DRRs using graphic hardware. This method is over 150 times faster than software rendering. And for registration accuracy and speed, we propose point-based 2D-3Dregistration of phantom dataset. And to reduce computation cost, we apply point-based registration technique. Because this method leads the computation time to about one second, the registration speed is enough to apply to intervention.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1500424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1500424/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8531842","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast 2D-3D registration using GPU-based preprocessing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast 2D-3D registration using GPU-based preprocessing","confLoc":"Busan, South Korea","sourcePdf":"01500424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061584S","chronDate":"23-25 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10018","isNumber":"32162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10018","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32162","articleId":"1500424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1500440,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang-Baek Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Silla University, Busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang-Baek Kim","id":"37087213898"},{"name":"Sung-Kwan Je","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Kwan Je","id":"37087519557"},{"name":"Gwang-Ha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gwang-Ha Kim","id":"37088131017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8940-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1500440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1500440","abstract":"Vector quantizer takes care of special image features like edges also and hence belongs to the class of quantizers known as second generation coders.

Data packing is achieved by discarding data blocks with values outside the data interval of interest and encoding the remaining data in a structure that can be efficiently decoded in the GPU. The compressed data can be transferred between disk, main memory, and video memory more efficiently, leading to more effective data exploration in both spatial and temporal domains.

Splatting has been mainly used to render pre-shaded volumes, which can result in significant blurring in zoomed views. This can be avoided in the image-aligned splatting scheme, where one accumulates kernel slices into equi-distant, parallel sheet buffers, followed by classification, shading, and compositing. In this work, we attempt to evolve this algorithm to the next level: GPU (graphics processing unit) based acceleration. First we describe the challenges that the highly parallel \"Gather\" architecture of modern GPUs poses to the \"Scatter\" based nature of a splatting algorithm. We then describe a number of strategies that exploit newly introduced features of the latest-generation hardware to address these limitations. Two crucial operations to boost the performance in image-aligned splatting are the early elimination of hidden splats and the skipping of empty buffer-space. We describe mechanisms which take advantage of the early z-culling hardware facilities to accomplish both of these operations efficiently in hardware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated image aligned splatting","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Workshop on Volume Graphics, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/VG.2005.194115","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Workshop on Volume Graphics, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10026/32170/01500542.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VG.2005.194115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32170","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1500542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1500542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated image aligned splatting","conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1500542/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8614912","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated image aligned splatting","confLoc":"Stony Brook, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01500542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046564S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10026","isNumber":"32170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10026","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32170","articleId":"1500542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Eurographics Assoc.","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1500567,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jiang Liu","id":"37087200523"},{"name":"L.P.

It enables the designers to evaluate the system linearity metrics, e.g. error vector magnitude (EVM), of the device-under-test (DUT) performance under different source, load impedances and input power levels. An interesting observation is that the source tuning has more influence on the EVM performance than the load tuning does for the DUT used in this study. Using this new measurement, the designers can have a better understanding of the device performance with respect to system metrics and optimize their designs to them directly, instead of resorting to the traditional analog RF nonlinear metrics only.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTGS.2005.1500567","publicationTitle":"65th ARFTG Conference Digest, 2005.

This model is based on two polynoms extracted from measured AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics with a complex stimulus excitation, like WCDMA, richer than a CW signal. Instantaneous power variation of WCDMA produces peak amplitudes which generate different AM/AM and AM/PM responses depending on their time history. Indeed, the accuracy of existing model based on CW excitation are insufficient to describe such non linear behaviour in new wireless applications. Then the two performance degradation factors: amplitude (AM/AM), and phase (AM/PM) polynoms are used to predict ACPR. The same signal excitation for characterization and simulation is guaranteed by the connected-solutions bench (Agilent) permitting real comparisons. For the experiments, we use a STMicroelectronics PPA (pre power amplifier), with 18dB gain, +6dBm of maximum power output and less than -50dBc of ACPR. The bandwidth corresponds to 1920-1980MHz for WCDMA applications. Our model can be extended to other signals and can be easily implemented into a simulator used by RF designers. The proposed method is less expensive and less time consuming than a complete electrical and dynamic characterization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Polynomials","Multiaccess communication","Predictive models","Power measurement","Power system modeling","Distortion measurement","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifiers","nonlinear network analysis","code division multiple access","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF power amplifier","fifth order polynomial","nonlinear behavior","AM/AM characteristics","AM/PM characteristics","WCDMA","CW signal","instantaneous power variation","AM/AM response","AM/PM responses","CW excitation","amplitude polynoms","phase polynoms","signal excitation","STMicroelectronics PPA","pre power amplifier","18 dB","1920 to 1980 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ARFTGS.2005.1500581","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01500581.png","publicationTitle":"65th ARFTG Conference Digest, 2005.

The goal of the proposed system is to automatically collect real-time information to improve the awareness of security personnel and decision makers. Our research is focused on the use of the \"known scene rarr no alarm/unknown scene rarr alarm\" paradigm, where the meaning of scene is related to spatial-temporal events, instead of the classical \"frame difference\" paradigm. The proposed system is able to detect mobile objects in the scene and to classify their movements (as allowed or disallowed) so as to raise an alarm whenever unacceptable movements are detected.

However, a major security concern is the possibility of intrusion by presenting a nonliving finger, be it a duplicate or a severed finger, to an electronic fingerprint scanner in order to gain access to a protected entity. It has been shown that one can spoof fingerprint scanners even with play-dohreg or gummy fingers. In order to circumvent this problem, one can read signals from the presented finger to verify its liveness and thus eliminate the threat of synthesized or cadaver finger attach. Earlier research has shown that the process of perspiration on the live fingertip skin presents a specific time progression that cannot be seen in cadaver or synthetic fingerprint scans, and thus phenomenon can be used as a measure of fingerprint liveness. However, the perspiration process demonstrates itself differently on different scanning technologies and thus a scanner-specific approach is needed. In this paper a new general evolutionary temporal neural network (GETnet) for perspiration-based liveness detection is proposed. It is shown that GETnet can arrive at a succinct solution that performs both feature extraction and classification on the raw fingerprint ridge signals. With the given variety of fingerprint scanners as well as the diversity of their operating conditions, including climate and user demographics, it is more efficient to automatically breed customized solutions for the perspiration-based fingerprint liveness detection through a general framework such as GETnet instead of tailoring feature extractors and classifiers to each and every different scenario","doi":"10.1109/CIHSPS.2005.1500621","startPage":"98","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"CIHSPS 2005.

In view of the physical constraints, the CPP's workspace range is determined analytically, which illustrates that the CPP possesses a regular like workspace with one isotropic configuration involved. Furthermore, the architecture design of the CPP is carried out to achieve a large usable workspace, and the dexterity performance has been verified.

Micropumps, microchannels, and a SPR biosensor were integrated into a single polymer (PMMA) based microfluidic system. Because SPR based bio-detection requires optically transparent substrates, PMMA is a potential replacement for glass and silicon-glass microfluidic systems, if bio-compatibility and low-cost are desired. The integrated system has been studied for its potential applications in bio-molecules detection and drug-discovery. Two experiments, 1) monitoring the reaction between BSA-BSA antibody, and 2) monitoring the activities of living cells in the presence or absence of trypsin in RPMI-1640 medium, were conducted to show its biomedical applications.

In ambient conditions without stringent environmental controls, nanomanipulation tasks require extensive human intervention to compensate for the many spatial uncertainties of the AFM. Among these uncertainties, thermal drift is especially hard to solve because it tends to increase with time and cannot be compensated simultaneously by feedback. In this paper, an automatic compensation scheme is introduced to measure and estimate drift. This information can be subsequently utilized to compensate for the thermal drift so that a real-time controller for nanomanipulation can be designed as if drift does not exist. Experimental results show that the proposed compensation scheme can predict drift with a small error. Future work is aimed at reducing the error even further through temperature feedback.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2005.1500773","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10038/32214/01500773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2005.1500773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32214","startPage":"370","endPage":"373 vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block phase correlation-based automatic drift compensation for atomic force microscopes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1500773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block phase correlation-based automatic drift compensation for atomic force microscopes","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1500773/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 July 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8681855","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1500773/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block phase correlation-based automatic drift compensation for atomic force microscopes","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"01500773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045986S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10038","isNumber":"32214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10038","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32214","articleId":"1500773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1500792,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this study we examined how well unimpaired subjects could learn to trace a novel path after they practiced it with mechanical guidance from a robot. The form of haptic guidance used was a virtual channel that constrained the hand to follow the desired path (a snake-like curve). Subjects substantially improved their ability to trace the path following practice with haptic guidance, relative to their performance following an initial visual demonstration. They slowly improved their performance with more haptic training. However, when asked to reproduce the path repeatedly, their performance degraded over the course of a few trials. The tracing errors were not random, but instead were consistent with a systematic evolution toward another path, as if being drawn to an \"attractor path\". These results suggest that haptic demonstration can improve short-term performance of a novel desired trajectory.

The final goal is to translate human trainers' skill into gait-training robot algorithms. Locomotor training is a rehabilitation technique in which three therapists assist the legs and hip of the patient to walk on a treadmill while part of the patient's body weight is supported by an overhead harness. We have developed a sensorized orthosis that measures shank kinematics and therapist forces during locomotor training. The orthosis is attached to one of the legs, so that one of the therapists assists through the orthotic interface. This interface is similar to how a locomotor-training robot is attached to the patient's shank. However, the force and intelligence behind the orthosis is not robotic, but human. Our intention is to quantify and analyze the human therapists' intelligence and expertise to help design better gait-training robot control algorithms. In this paper we present some preliminary results from the first locomotor training sessions with spinal cord injured patients using this sensor system. A key initial finding is that even skilled trainers assist with substantial differences in terms of both forces and motions. With the same patient, same stepping speed and same body weight support, the differences in peak forces applied to the knee between trainers were up to 100% in some sessions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anthropometry","Humans","Algorithm design and analysis","Robot control","Spinal cord injury","Robot sensing systems","Intelligent robots","Leg","Rehabilitation robotics","Hip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical robotics","patient rehabilitation","neurophysiology","orthotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human trainers skill","robot control algorithm","therapists","locomotor training","spinal cord injury","gait-training robot algorithm","sensorized orthosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501092","doi":"10.1109/ICORR.2005.1501092","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, 2005.

To cope with the nonstationary signal property of the EMG, features are extracted by wavelet packet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of PCA and SOFM. The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier, and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features to a new feature space with high class separability. Finally a multilayer neural network is employed as the pattern classifier. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction virtual hand. From experimental results, we show that all processes, including virtual hand control, are completed within 125 msec, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operation time delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICORR.2005.1501105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32216","startPage":"295","endPage":"298","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics, 2005.

Several research groups are attempting to automate this principle with robotic movement training devices. This paper derives an \"assist as needed\" robotic training algorithm by framing the problem as an optimization problem. We assume that motor recovery can be modeled as a process of learning a novel sensory motor transformation. The optimized robotic movement trainer is then an error-based controller with a forgetting factor. It bounds kinematic errors while systematically reducing its assistance. The same controller also works well if the dominant dynamics of recovery are akin to a strengthening process. We experimentally validate the controller with an unimpaired subject by demonstrating how the controller can help the subject to learn a novel sensory motor transformation (i.e. an internal model) with smaller kinematic errors than typical. The task studied here is walking on a treadmill in the presence of a novel dynamic environment. The assist-as-needed controller proposed here may be useful for limiting error during the learning of tasks in which large errors are dangerous or discouraging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28 June-1 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501108/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501108/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8643866","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robotic movement training as an optimization problem: designing a controller that assists only as needed","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic movement training as an optimization problem: designing a controller that assists only as needed","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01501108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058705S","chronDate":"28 June-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10041","isNumber":"32216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10041","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"32216","articleId":"1501108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501120,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Area of influence (AOI) derives from the observation that in nature the effective exchange of information between individuals of a society deteriorates as their physical distance increases. In PSO with AOI, the loss of information exchange, ability with distance is simulated by making the exchange of information a function of the physical distance between particles in hyperspace. In this paper, we compare the AOI method to the standard PSO neighborhood methods, global best, local best, and von Neumann. We also introduce a local search method using reinitialization of velocity components based on the current search range. We show that AOI along with local search and a time-varying constriction coefficient provides strong benefits to several PSO algorithms. Results are presented using the standard benchmark functions from the PSO literature.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2005.1501601","startPage":"45","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005.

Routing is the task of directing data packets from a source node to a given destination. This task is particularly hard in mobile ad hoc networks: due to the mobility of the network elements and the lack of central control, routing algorithms should be robust, adaptive, and work in a decentralized and self-organizing way. In this paper, we describe an algorithm, which draws inspiration from swarm intelligence to obtain these characteristics. More specifically, we borrow ideas from ant colonies and from the ant colony optimization framework. In an extensive set of simulation tests, we compare our routing algorithm with a state-of-the-art algorithm, and show that it gets better performance over a wide range of different scenarios and for a number of different evaluation measures. In particular, we show that it scales better with the number of nodes in the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501605/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8705601","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Swarm intelligence for routing in mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swarm intelligence for routing in mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01501605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066713S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10043","isNumber":"32218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10043","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"32218","articleId":"1501605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1501607,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The approach is based on a competitive co-evolutionary technique, which simultaneously evolves two populations of particles. The first population optimizes the feedforward CTC parameters and the second population searches for the disturbance values in the worst case. Both together generate the robust solution. The co-evolutionary PSO is modified in a way that prevents premature convergence to solutions that are located at the boundary of the parameter space. The robustness of the solution is measured by the capability of the tuned feedforward CTC to demonstrate good trajectory tracking performance in the presence of disturbances. Simulations of the closed loop system demonstrate that this control strategy provides robust control and improves trajectory tracking of a perturbed 5-DOF robot arm manipulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501617/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8705613","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501617/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter tuning of a computed-torque controller for a 5 degree of freedom robot arm using co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter tuning of a computed-torque controller for a 5 degree of freedom robot arm using co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01501617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079964S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10043","isNumber":"32218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10043","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32218","articleId":"1501617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1501618,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Recent studies have shown that partitional clustering algorithms are more suitable for clustering large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm, the most commonly used partitional clustering algorithm, can only generate a local optimal solution. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) document clustering algorithm. Contrary to the localized searching of the K-means algorithm, the PSO clustering algorithm performs a globalized search in the entire solution space. In the experiments we conducted, we applied the PSO, K-means and hybrid PSO clustering algorithm on four different text document datasets. The number of documents in the datasets ranges from 204 to over 800, and the number of terms ranges from over 5000 to over 7000. The results illustrate that the hybrid PSO algorithm can generate more compact clustering results than the K-means algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2005.1501621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2005.1501621","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005.

S-PSO iteratively optimizes the objective function over randomly selected subspaces of the parameter search space instead of the entire parameter space at once as in standard PSO. This approach is advantageous since fewer particles are needed to solve the lower-dimension subproblems.

Our investigation utilizes a generational survival task to measure the benefit of communication in a biological setting. Swarm members forage for food, consuming energy in the process, and returning to a central \"hive\" to contribute any surplus. The resources of the hive determine when reproduction is possible, so it is in the best interest of the population to maximize the efficiency of foraging. The measure of performance is the size of the swarm surviving at the end of a simulation run. Each simulation begins with a swarm of fixed size (5 agents), making contributions to the hive (and subsequent procreation) necessary for good performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501661/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501661/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8705657","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The effect of environmental structure on the utility of communication in hive-based swarms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of environmental structure on the utility of communication in hive-based swarms","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01501661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090483S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10043","isNumber":"32218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10043","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32218","articleId":"1501661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1501744,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The first step in dynamic optimization consists of detecting frequently executed code, or \"critical regions.\" Most previous critical region detectors have been targeted to desktop processors. We introduce a critical region detector targeted to embedded processors, with the unique features of being very size and power efficient and being completely nonintrusive to the software's execution-features needed in timing-sensitive embedded systems. Our detector not only finds the critical regions, but also determines their relative frequencies, a potentially important feature for selecting among alternative dynamic optimization methods. Our detector uses a tiny cache-like structure coupled with a small amount of logic. We provide results of extensive explorations across 19 embedded system benchmarks. We show that highly accurate results can be achieved with only a 0.02 percent power overhead, acceptable size overhead; and zero runtime overhead. Our detector is currently being used as part of a dynamic hardware/software partitioning approach, but is applicable to a wide variety of situations.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/32222/01501787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32222","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequent loop detection using efficient nonintrusive on-chip hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequent loop detection using efficient nonintrusive on-chip hardware","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8637413","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequent loop detection using efficient nonintrusive on-chip hardware","sourcePdf":"01501787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147394S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"32222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32222","articleId":"1501787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501790,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We develop techniques that can lead to smaller memory requirements in the synthesis of dedicated processors or to more effective use by compiled code of software-controlled scratchpad memory. Memory reuse is well-understood for allocating registers to hold scalar variables. Its extension to arrays has been studied recently for multimedia applications, for loop parallelization, and for circuit synthesis from recurrence equations. In all such studies, the introduction of modulo operations to an otherwise affine mapping (of loop or array indices to memory locations) achieves the desired reuse. We develop here a new mathematical framework, based on critical lattices, that subsumes the previous approaches and provides new insight. We first consider the set of indices that conflict, those that cannot be mapped to the same memory cell. Next, we construct the set of differences of conflicting indices. We establish a correspondence between a valid modular mapping and a strictly-admissible integer lattice-one having no nonzero element in common with the set of conflicting index differences. The memory required by an optimal modular mapping is equal to the determinant of the corresponding lattice. The memory reuse problem is thus reduced to the (still interesting and nontrivial) problem of finding a strictly admissible integer lattice-of least determinant. We then propose and analyze several practical strategies for finding strictly admissible integer lattices, either optimal or optimal up to a multiplicative factor, and, hence, memory-saving modular mappings. We explain and analyze previous approaches in terms of our new framework.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2005.167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/32222/01501790.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2005.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32222","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice-based memory allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lattice-based memory allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8637416","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501790/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice-based memory allocation","sourcePdf":"01501790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098362S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"32222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"32222","articleId":"1501790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1501792,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This paper investigates the QoS-aware replica placement problems for responsiveness QoS requirements. We consider two classes of service models: replica-aware services and replica-blind services. In replica-aware services, the servers are aware of the locations of replicas and can therefore optimize request routing to improve responsiveness. We show that the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for fast computation of good solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated. In replica-blind services, the servers are not aware of the locations of replicas or even their existence.

Providing automatic annotation requires an accurate mapping of images' low-level perceptual features (e.g., color and texture) to some high-level semantic labels (e.g., landscape, architecture, and animals). Much work has been performed in this area; however, there is a lack of ability to assess the quality of annotation. In this paper, we propose a confidence-based dynamic ensemble (CDE), which employs a three-level classification scheme. At the base-level, CDE uses one-class support vector machines (SVMs) to characterize a confidence factor for ascertaining the correctness of an annotation (or a class prediction) made by a binary SVM classifier. The confidence factor is then propagated to the multiclass classifiers at subsequent levels. CDE uses the confidence factor to make dynamic adjustments to its member classifiers so as to improve class-prediction accuracy, to accommodate new semantics, and to assist in the discovery of useful low-level features. Our empirical studies on a large real-world data set demonstrate CDE to be very effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8611714","htmlLink":"/document/1501818/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using one-class and two-class SVMs for multiclass image annotation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using one-class and two-class SVMs for multiclass image annotation","sourcePdf":"01501818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079601S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"32224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"32224","articleId":"1501818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":1501840,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Bo Duan","affiliation":["The BioInformatics Research Centre, School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/32225/1501840/1501840-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Bo Duan received the B.Eng. degree in power engineering and the M.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from National University of Singapore in 2004 for his research work on SVMs and kernel classification methods.","He joined the BioInformatics Research Centre, School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, in 2003 and is currently a Research Fellow working on machine learning methods to computational biology.

Unlike the SVM-RFE method, at each step, the proposed approach computes the feature ranking score from a statistical analysis of weight vectors of multiple linear SVMs trained on subsamples of the original training data. We tested the proposed method on four gene expression datasets for cancer classification. The results show that the proposed feature selection method selects better gene subsets than the original SVM-RFE and improves the classification accuracy. A Gene Ontology-based similarity assessment indicates that the selected subsets are functionally diverse, further validating our gene selection method. This investigation also suggests that, for gene expression-based cancer classification, average test error from multiple partitions of training and test sets can be recommended as a reference of performance quality.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2005.853657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/32225/01501840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2005.853657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32225","startPage":"228","endPage":"234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple SVM-RFE for gene selection in cancer classification with expression data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple SVM-RFE for gene selection in cancer classification with expression data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8561861","pubMedId":"16220686","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501840/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple SVM-RFE for gene selection in cancer classification with expression data","sourcePdf":"01501840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072731S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"32225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"32225","articleId":"1501840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1501852,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Deng","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China","School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Central South University, Changhua, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/32226/1501852/1501852-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Deng received the B.Eng. degree from Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, Nanjing, China, in 1983, the M.Eng. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2005.","He was an Associate Professor at Changsha University of Science and Technology, China.

The snap curing oven can be described by a nonlinear parabolic distributed parameter system (DPS) in the time-space domain. After finding a proper approximation of the complex boundary conditions of the system, the spectral methods can be applied to time-space separation and model reduction, and neural networks (NNs) can be used for state estimation and system identification. With the help of model reduction techniques, the dynamics of the curing process derived from physical laws can be described by a model of low-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations with a few uncertain parameters and unknown nonlinearities. A neural observer can then be designed to estimate the states of the ordinary differential equation model from measurements taken at specified locations in the field. Using the estimated states, a hybrid general regression NN is trained to be a nonlinear model of the curing process in state-space formulation, which is suitable for the further application of traditional control techniques. Real-time experiments on the snap curing oven show that the proposed modeling method is effective. This modeling methodology can be applied to a class of nonlinear DPSs in industrial thermal processing.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.847329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"686","endPage":"700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.847329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32226","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/32226/01501852.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Curing","Ovens","State estimation","Reduced order systems","Neural networks","Differential equations","Semiconductor device packaging","Distributed parameter systems","Boundary conditions","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curing","distributed parameter systems","observers","nonlinear differential equations","neural nets","regression analysis","state-space methods","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit packaging","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed thermal process","spectral-approximation based intelligent modeling","snap curing oven","semiconductor packaging industry","nonlinear parabolic distributed parameter system","time-space domain","complex boundary condition","time-space separation","model reduction techniques","neural networks","state estimation","system identification","curing process","low-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations","neural observer","hybrid general regression","industrial thermal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Curing process","distributed thermal process","neural networks (NNs)","nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs)","spatial system identification","spectral methods","state estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectral-approximation-based intelligent modeling for distributed thermal processes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501852/","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1501852/","accessionNumber":"8563363","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral-approximation-based intelligent modeling for distributed thermal processes","sourcePdf":"01501852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109259S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"32226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"32226","articleId":"1501852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1501854,"authors":[{"name":"Kemao Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/32226/1501854/1501854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kemao Peng was born in Anhui Province, China, in 1964.

Thus, it is highly desirable to characterize the behaviors of nonlinearities and friction in the servo systems. This paper presents a fairly comprehensive modeling and compensation of friction and nonlinearities of a typical voice-coil-motor (VCM) actuator used in commercial HDDs, and the design of an HDD servo system using an enhanced nonlinear control technique. Our contributions are two-fold: We will first obtain a complete model of the VCM actuator including friction and nonlinear characteristics through a careful examination of the configuration and structure of the actual system and through a thorough analysis of its physical effects together with its time-domain and frequency-domain responses. We will then proceed to design a servo system for the hard drive using an enhanced composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control technique with a simple friction and nonlinearity compensation scheme. The enhanced CNF technique has a feature of removing the uncompensated portion of friction and nonlinearities without sacrificing the overall tracking performance. Simulation and experimental results for both the modeling and the servo design show that our approach is very effective and successful. In particular, our experimental results show that the enhanced CNF control has outperformed the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control in settling time by 76%. We believe that this approach can be adopted to solve other servomechanism problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2005.854321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2005.854321","startPage":"708","endPage":"721","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/32226/01501854.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and compensation of nonlinearities and friction in a micro hard disk drive servo system with nonlinear feedback control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and compensation of nonlinearities and friction in a micro hard disk drive servo system with nonlinear feedback control","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501854/","accessionNumber":"8563365","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501854/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and compensation of nonlinearities and friction in a micro hard disk drive servo system with nonlinear feedback control","sourcePdf":"01501854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071526S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"32226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"32226","articleId":"1501854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1501870,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We analyzed several discrete wavelet transform (DWT) architectures and selected the folded DWT design. In addition we provide a study on what storage elements are required for each wavelet coefficient. A modification to the original SPIHT algorithm is implemented to parallelize the computation. The architecture of our SPIHT engine is based upon fixed-order SPIHT, developed specifically for use within adaptive hardware. For an N/spl times/N image fixed-order SPIHT may be calculated in N/sup 2//4 cycles. Square images which are powers of 2 up to 1024/spl times/1024 are supported by the architecture. Our system was developed on an Annapolis Microsystems WildStar board populated with Xilinx Virtex-E parts.

Hardware-accelerated performance is a key to successful development of real time JPEG 2000 solutions for applications such as digital cinema and digital home theatre. The crucial role in the whole processing plays embedded block coding with optimized truncation because it requires bit-level operations. In this paper, a dedicated architecture of the block-coding engine is presented. Square-based bit-plane scanning and the internal first-in first-out are combined to speed up the context generation. A dynamic significance state restoring technique reduces the size of the state memories to 1 kbits. The pipeline architecture enhanced by an inverse multiple branch selection method is exploited to code two context-symbol pairs per clock cycle in the arithmetic coder module. The block-coding architecture was implemented in VHDL and synthesized for field-programmable gate array devices. Simulation results show that the single engine can process, on average, about 22 million samples at 66-MHz working frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2005.852720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/32227/01501886.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2005.852720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-performance architecture for embedded block coding in JPEG 2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501886/","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance architecture for embedded block coding in JPEG 2000","volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8562747","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501886/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance architecture for embedded block coding in JPEG 2000","sourcePdf":"01501886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088702S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"32227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"32227","articleId":"1501886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1501900,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/32228/1501900/1501900-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianwen Zhu (M'00) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of California, Irvine, in 1993, 1996 and 1999, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

As the foundries accelerate their update of advanced processes with increasingly complex design rules, and the libraries grow in flexibility and size, the cost of library development becomes prohibitively high. Automated layout-migration techniques used today, which are based on layout compaction developed a decade ago, corrupt advanced design considerations by honoring only design rules, and cannot cope with some of the new challenges involved. In this paper, we present a new integer linear programming (ILP)-based layout-migration engine, called calligrapher, and make the following contributions. First, we extend the recently proposed minimum perturbation (MP) metric designed to retain original layout design intentions, while overcoming its shortcoming of biased treatment of layout objects. Second, we propose a new design-rule-constraint algorithm, and prove its linear complexity for the number of constraints generated. Compared with what has been achieved in the literature, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the ILP solver time by limiting the constraint size. Third, we propose an iterative migration framework based on the concept of soft constraint. With this framework, two-dimensional compaction quality can be achieved with a runtime comparable to one-dimensional compaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of calligrapher by migrating the Berkeley low-power libraries, originally developed for the 1.2-/spl mu/m MOSIS process, into TSMC 0.25- and 0.18-/spl mu/m technologies. We show that even for a very compact layout, our metric and the MP metric can make a difference by as much as 20%-45%. We also show that our iterative algorithm can improve the area by 10% on average compared to the traditional technique using the MP metric, and inflates the area by merely 7.5% compared to the traditional technique using minimum-area metric.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.852040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/32228/01501900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.852040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32228","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calligrapher: a new layout-migration engine for hard intellectual property libraries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calligrapher: a new layout-migration engine for hard intellectual property libraries","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8557384","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501900/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calligrapher: a new layout-migration engine for hard intellectual property libraries","sourcePdf":"01501900.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079723S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"32228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"32228","articleId":"1501900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501902,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Circuit simulation at a set of worst case corners is a computationally efficient method for verifying the robustness of a design. This paper presents a new statistical methodology to determine the worst case corners for a set of circuit performances. The proposed methodology first estimates response surfaces for circuit performances as quadratic functions of the process parameters with known statistical distributions. These response surfaces are then used to extract the worst case corners in the process parameter space as the points where the circuit performances are at their minimum/maximum values corresponding to a specified tolerance level. Corners in the process parameter space close to each other are clustered to reduce their number, which reduces the number of simulations required for design verification. The novel concept of a relaxation coefficient to ensure that the corners capture the minimum/maximum values of all the circuit performances at the desired tolerance level is also introduced. The corners are realistic since they are derived from the multivariate statistical distribution of the process parameters at the desired tolerance level. The methodology is demonstrated with examples showing extraction of corners from digital standard cells and also the corners for analog/radio frequency (RF) blocks found in typical communication ICs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided software engineering","Response surface methodology","Circuit simulation","Computational modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Robustness","SPICE","Statistical distributions","Radio frequency","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","application specific integrated circuits","statistical analysis","circuit simulation","circuit CAD","SPICE","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-specific worst case corners","response surfaces","statistical models","manufacturing variations","circuit simulation","quadratic functions","process parameters","statistical distributions","design verification","relaxation coefficient","digital standard cells","analog radio frequency blocks","communication IC","application specific integrated circuits","circuit modeling","tolerance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","circuit modeling","semiconductor device modeling","sensitivity","tolerance analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.852037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/32228/01501902.pdf","startPage":"1372","endPage":"1380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.852037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-specific worst case corners using response surfaces and statistical models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application-specific worst case corners using response surfaces and statistical models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501902/","volume":"24","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501902/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8557386","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-specific worst case corners using response surfaces and statistical models","sourcePdf":"01501902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062307S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"32228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"32228","articleId":"1501902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":1501906,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gang Wang","affiliation":["EM Academy, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China","Wireless Communications Research Center, City University of Hong Kong, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/32228/1501906/1501906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Gang Wang (M'04) was born in Guangdong Province, China.

In MLGFIM, the problem domain is first divided into multilevel cubes. Next, the peer-level Green's function interpolation technique is employed, and then, a new lower-to-upper-level Green's function interpolation technique is devised. They are used with the multilevel discretization to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in the iterative solution in which a computational complexity of O(N) is achieved. The MLGFIM is used to extract the capacitances encountered in radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) and microelectromechanical systems. Moreover, to demonstrate its efficiency both in simulation speed and memory storage requirement, MLGFIM is compared with FastCap for free space problems and applied to extract capacitances from multilayered structures. For problems with 375,000 unknowns, the proposed method only requires 343 MB of computer memory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multilevel Green's function interpolation method for large-scale low-frequency EM simulations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/32228/01501906.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new multilevel Green's function interpolation method for large-scale low-frequency EM simulations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1501906/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8557390","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multilevel Green's function interpolation method for large-scale low-frequency EM simulations","sourcePdf":"01501906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118312S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"32228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"32228","articleId":"1501906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501909,"authors":[{"name":"Hongliang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/32228/1501909/1501909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongliang Chang (S'05) received the B.E. degree from Qiqihar University, Qiqihaer, China, and the M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 1996 and 2001, respectively.

An efficient statistical timing analysis algorithm that predicts the probability distribution of the circuit delay considering both inter-die and intra-die variations, while accounting for the effects of spatial correlations of intra-die parameter variations, is presented. The procedure uses a first-order Taylor series expansion to approximate the gate and interconnect delays. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) techniques are employed to transform the set of correlated parameters into an uncorrelated set. The statistical timing computation is then easily performed with a program evaluation and review technique (PERT)-like circuit graph traversal. The run time of this algorithm is linear in the number of gates and interconnects, as well as the number of varying parameters and grid partitions that are used to model spatial correlations. The accuracy of the method is verified with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. On average, for the 100 nm technology, the errors of mean and standard deviation (SD) values computed by the proposed method are 1.06% and -4.34%, respectively, and the errors of predicting the 99% and 1% confidence point are -2.46% and -0.99%, respectively.

It may be difficult, however, for radiologists to distinguish malignant from benign nodules in LDCT. Our purpose in this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for distinction between benign and malignant nodules in LDCT scans by use of a massive training artificial neural network (MTANN). The MTANN is a trainable, highly nonlinear filter based on an artificial neural network. To distinguish malignant nodules from six different types of benign nodules, we developed multiple MTANNs (multi-MTANN) consisting of six expert MTANNs that are arranged in parallel. Each of the MTANNs was trained by use of input CT images and teaching images containing the estimate of the distribution for the \"likelihood of being a malignant nodule\", i.e., the teaching image for a malignant nodule contains a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and that for a benign nodule contains zero. Each MTANN was trained independently with ten typical malignant nodules and ten benign nodules from each of the six types. The outputs of the six MTANNs were combined by use of an integration ANN such that the six types of benign nodules could be distinguished from malignant nodules. After training of the integration ANN, our scheme provided a value related to the \"likelihood of malignancy\" of a nodule, i.e., a higher value indicates a malignant nodule, and a lower value indicates a benign nodule. Our database consisted of 76 primary lung cancers in 73 patients and 413 benign nodules in 342 patients, which were obtained from a lung cancer screening program on 7847 screenees with LDCT for three years in Nagano, Japan. The performance of our scheme for distinction between benign and malignant nodules was evaluated by use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Our scheme achieved an Az (area under the ROC curve) value of 0.882 in a round-robin test. Our scheme correctly identified 100% (76/76) of malignant nodules as malignant, whereas 48% (200/413) of benign nodules were identified correctly as benign. Therefore, our scheme may be useful in assisting radiologists in the diagnosis of lung nodules in LDCT.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2005.852048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/32229/01501920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2005.852048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32229","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided diagnostic scheme for distinction between benign and malignant nodules in thoracic low-dose CT by use of massive training artificial neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided diagnostic scheme for distinction between benign and malignant nodules in thoracic low-dose CT by use of massive training artificial neural network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8566762","pubMedId":"16156352","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501920/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided diagnostic scheme for distinction between benign and malignant nodules in thoracic low-dose CT by use of massive training artificial neural network","sourcePdf":"01501920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139383S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"32229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"32229","articleId":"1501920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1501944,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

This new package type is an extension of flip chip packaging technology to standard surface mount technology. The package has been targeted for low pin count (less than 30) and has high volume applications such as cellular phones, hand-held PDAs, etc. The WL-CSP is typically used without underfill and so solder joint reliability is a prime concern. Thus it is imperative to have a good understanding of the various design parameters of the package that affect the reliability of the solder joint. This paper presents the effect of geometrical parameters such as die size, die thickness, solder joint diameter and height on the reliability of solder joints. The effects of different dwell times, temperature range and ramp rates on the reliability of the solder joints is also studied by applying different temperature cycles to the package. A 16 I/O ADI WLCSP called MicroCSP is used as the primary test vehicle for the thermal cycling tests performed with different ramp/hold profiles.

In this paper, we solve equations for total energy to provide an analytical solution for the optimum V/sub DD/ and V/sub T/ to minimize energy for a given frequency in subthreshold operation. We show the dependence of the optimum V/sub DD/ for a given technology on design characteristics and operating conditions. This paper also examines the effect of sizing on energy consumption for subthreshold circuits. We show that minimum sized devices are theoretically optimal for reducing energy. A fabricated 0.18-/spl mu/m test chip is used to compare normal sizing and sizing to minimize operational V/sub DD/ and to verify the energy models. Measurements show that existing standard cell libraries offer a good solution for minimizing energy in subthreshold circuits.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501975.pdf","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and sizing for minimum energy operation in subthreshold circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and sizing for minimum energy operation in subthreshold circuits","volume":"40","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501975/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8560012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501975/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and sizing for minimum energy operation in subthreshold circuits","sourcePdf":"01501975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082842S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"352","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1501976,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The proposed method is fast and can be used to predict delay distribution in nanoscale CMOS technologies both at the circuit and the device design phase. The method is applied to predict the delay distributions in different logic gates and flip-flops and is verified with detail Monte Carlo simulations. It is observed that a 30% spread (STD/Mean) in Vt variation results in 5% spread in the delay of logic gates (inverter, NAND, etc.). The effect of Vt variation due to RDF is more significant in the setup time (STD/Mean = 11%) and clock-to-output delay (STD/Mean = 5% to 25%) of flip-flops.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501976.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of delay variations due to random-dopant fluctuations in nanoscale CMOS circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501976/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of delay variations due to random-dopant fluctuations in nanoscale CMOS circuits","volume":"40","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8560013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1501976/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of delay variations due to random-dopant fluctuations in nanoscale CMOS circuits","sourcePdf":"01501976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05214S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501978,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These atomic-level intrinsic fluctuations cannot be eliminated by external control of the manufacturing process and are most pronounced in minimum-geometry transistors commonly used in area-constrained circuits such as SRAM cells. Consequently, a large number of cells in a memory are expected to be faulty due to process variations in sub-50-nm technologies. This paper analyzes SRAM cell failures under process variation and proposes new variation-aware cache architecture suitable for high performance applications. The proposed architecture adaptively resizes the cache to avoid faulty cells, thereby improving yield. This scheme is transparent to processor architecture and has negligible energy and area overhead. Experimental results on a 32 K direct map L1 cache show that the proposed architecture can achieve 93% yield compared to its original 33%. The Simplescalar simulation shows that designing the data and instruction cache using the proposed architecture results in 1.5% and 5.7% average CPU performance loss (over SPEC 2000 benchmarks), respectively, for the chips with maximum number of faulty cells which can be tolerated by our proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501978.pdf","startPage":"1804","endPage":"1814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process variation in embedded memories: failure analysis and variation aware architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Process variation in embedded memories: failure analysis and variation aware architecture","volume":"40","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"8560015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501978/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process variation in embedded memories: failure analysis and variation aware architecture","sourcePdf":"01501978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117291S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1501979,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

It consists of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a clock generation system, and a digital back-end. The clock generation system provides different phases of a 300-MHz clock using four differential inverter stages. The specification of the jitter standard deviation is 100 ps. The Flash interleaved ADC provides four bit samples at 1.2 Gsps. The back-end uses parallelization to process these samples and to reduce the signal acquisition time to 65 /spl mu/s. The entire synchronization algorithm is implemented in the digital domain, without feeding any signals back to the clock control. The baseband processor and ADC were implemented on the same 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS die at 1.8 V as part of a complete baseband transceiver. A wireless data rate of 193 kb/s is demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501980.pdf","startPage":"1821","endPage":"1828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1501980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A baseband processor for impulse ultra-wideband communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Ultra wideband technology","Clocks","Signal processing","Analog-digital conversion","Inverters","Jitter","Synchronization","CMOS process","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband communication","digital signal processing chips","analogue-digital conversion","clocks","transceivers","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baseband processor","impulse ultra-wideband communications","analog-to-digital converter","clock generation system","digital back-end","synchronization algorithm","CMOS","baseband transceiver","radio receivers","ultra-wideband technology","193 kbit/s","300 MHz","0.18 micron","1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital conversion","radio receivers","synchronization","transceivers","ultra-wideband technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"A baseband processor for impulse ultra-wideband communications","volume":"40","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1501980/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8560017","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A baseband processor for impulse ultra-wideband communications","sourcePdf":"01501980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048331S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501981,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The core of the system is an array of 32 /spl times/ 32 rangefinding pixels that independently measure the time-of-flight of a ray of light as it is reflected back from the objects in a scene. A single cone of pulsed laser light illuminates the scene, thus no complex mechanical scanning or expensive optical equipment are needed. Millimetric depth accuracies can be reached thanks to the rangefinder's optical detectors that enable picosecond time discrimination. The detectors, based on a single photon avalanche diode operating in Geiger mode, utilize avalanche multiplication to enhance light detection. On-pixel high-speed electrical amplification can therefore be eliminated, thus greatly simplifying the array and potentially reducing its power dissipation. Optical power requirements on the light source can also be significantly relaxed, due to the array's sensitivity to single photon events. A number of standard performance measurements, conducted on the imager, are discussed in the paper. The 3-D imaging system was also tested on real 3-D subjects, including human facial models, demonstrating the suitability of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.848173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.848173","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501983.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and characterization of a CMOS 3-D image sensor based on single photon avalanche diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and characterization of a CMOS 3-D image sensor based on single photon avalanche diodes","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8560020","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1501983/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and characterization of a CMOS 3-D image sensor based on single photon avalanche diodes","sourcePdf":"01501983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049659S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1501984,"authors":[{"name":"KiYoung Nam","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Systems, Standford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/32231/1501984/1501984-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["KiYoung Nam (S'97) received the B.S. degrees in metallurgical system engineering and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 1999, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

The die contains 256 optical receive channels with -47 dBm optical sensitivity and 30 dB optical dynamic range at 500 kb/s/channel while consuming 67 mW. Received signals are amplified by digitally self-calibrated open-loop amplifiers and digitized before clock and data recovery. The sampled data also provide inputs for digital automatic gain and offset control loops closed around the analog amplifier chain to compensate for signal variations due to atmospheric turbulence and daylight interference. Gain control logic can adapt to incident signals over the 30 dB dynamic range within 28 bit periods. Low-power logic design and analog circuit techniques are used to minimize digital crosstalk to single-ended photodetectors referenced to a bulk substrate. Local arbitration circuitry at each channel forms an intrachip data passing network to multiplex received data words from the 16 /spl times/ 16 array onto a common off-chip bus. The 1.6 M transistor mixed-signal die fabricated in a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS process measures 6.5/spl times/6.5 mm/sup 2/. Reception at 500 kb/s through a 1.5 km atmospheric channel is demonstrated with 3 mW optical transmit power during nighttime and daylight hours.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.848148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32231/01501995.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.848148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 256-element CMOS imaging receiver for free-space optical communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1501995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 August 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A 256-element CMOS imaging receiver for free-space optical communication","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8560032","htmlLink":"/document/1501995/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 256-element CMOS imaging receiver for free-space optical communication","sourcePdf":"01501995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168603S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32231","articleId":"1501995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1501996,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Predicting the expected life of these components in this application is complicated by four factors. First, the electrical impedance of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is nonlinear with both frequency and temperature. Second, motor drives produce a spectrally rich ripple current waveform, which makes energy loss difficult to compute. Third, the heat transfer characteristic of capacitor banks is dependent on design geometry. Fourth, the expected life of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is extremely sensitive to operating temperature. This paper describes a method for predicting bus capacitor life that addresses these problems by using a multiple component model for capacitor impedance, a motor drive simulation to create ripple current waveforms, a heat transfer model based on bank geometry, and a capacitor life model derived from the device physics of failure. An example is given showing the effect of AC line impedance on relative expected life","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502060/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8540553","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502060/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Life prediction modeling of bus capacitors in AC variable frequency drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Life prediction modeling of bus capacitors in AC variable frequency drives","confLoc":"Jacksonville, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01502060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079112S","chronDate":"23-23 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10016","isNumber":"32160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10016","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"32160","articleId":"1502060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502115,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

Hence, the capture process should be guided by controlling the initial beam steering. On the other hand, the matrix pencil (MP) algorithm is used to estimate the direction of arrival of all users incident in the array antenna. It uses a single snapshot to estimate the DOA and is not affected by correlation sources problem. Also, the matrix pencil algorithm when combined with CDMA is able to separate the DOA of the different users based on the orthogonality of the used spreading codes. The first presented technique in this paper is to use the MP-CDMA to blindly estimate the initial beam steering of the LS-CMA array, this combination allows to steer the initial beam of LS-CMA array antenna toward the desired user's direction. Therefore the desired user will have a dominant power at the array output and LSCMA will capture it. This technique is called MP-CDMA guided LS-CMA algorithm. The second presented technique to use the MP-CDMA combined with the minimum square (MS) beamforming for moving target (user) detection and tracking. The MP-CDMA is used to blindly estimate the steering matrix response of all the incident signals on the array at every snapshot and estimates the update array weight using MS beamforming. Computer simulations show the high efficiency of the proposed MPCDMA-LSCMA in separating CDMA signals of co-channel users. Also, we show that the MP-CDMA combined with MS beamforming can be efficiently used for tracking a moving user operating with other stationary users","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Second National Radio Science Conference, 2005.

Both the multitarget least-squares constant modulus algorithm (MT-LSCMA) and the multitarget steepest-descent decision-directed (MT-SDDD) requires a high computational complexity. Here we modify the original algorithm to reduce the computational complexity by replacing the set of sorting and classifications by employing DOA estimation techniques. The DOA estimation is utilized to initialize the weights of the multitarget blind beamformers. It is shown from the simulation results that these modified algorithms have less complexity and faster convergence than the original ones. A computer simulation of these modified algorithms along with the-least squares de-spread re-spread multitarget array (LS-DRMTA) and least squares de-spread re-spread multitarget constant modulus algorithm (LS-DRMTCMA) are performed. The proposed initially guided multitarget adaptive array algorithms and the generalized LS-DRMTCMA are extended and studied for QPSK. base band modulation technique.

Methods based on cost function matched to the signal constellation namely alphabet matched algorithm (AMA) were previously reported and proves its superiority on CMA concerning the MSE. Thus dual mode algorithms between CMA and AMA were introduced. A hybrid technique combining CMA and AMA using a cosine square function as a constellation matched error (CME) was lately reported. In this paper two different CME functions are introduced. The MSE of the proposed algorithms are calculated using Matlab simulation under multipath fading channels for different signal to noise ratios (SNR) and different levels of QAM constellations. A comparison is established among them. Depicted results show that the choice of the CME function will mainly depend on the number of constellation points","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2005.194009","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Second National Radio Science Conference, 2005.

The problem is treated by designing a filter like algorithm to separate certain phone or a group of phones from the complete set. The designed filter conveys a good information regarding the phone it extracts. The speech data that is introduced to the filters are prepared by a certain speech model that is based on wavelet transform. This model is introduced into Amr M. Gody (2003) and Amr M. Gody (2002). A brief illustration of the model is included in the introduction section. The work is applied on the Arabic language phone set. A database of many hours of Arabic dialogs is used. The database is recorded from 30 male speakers. Genetic algorithm is utilized in phone pass filter (PPF) parameters design. The 6 coefficients filters are analyzed to extract all the possible phone properties. The speaker dependency is localized.

The proposed algorithm uses a modification to the root-selection algorithm for channel estimation and a generalized Akaike information criterion to estimate the channel length. The new algorithm is termed, the modified root-selection (MRS) algorithm. This algorithm together with the channel order estimation effectively reduces the signal space of the estimator, and hence improves the estimation performance as demonstrated using computer simulations. The proposed MRS with channel estimation algorithm has a 5 dB lower mean square error in channel estimation when compared to the conventional RS approach which translates to approximately 0.5 dB improvement in SNR at receiver. In addition, the proposed modification to the RS algorithm results in a more computationally efficient algorithm. It is applicable not only to standard OFDM transmitters with cyclic prefix, but also to the recently proposed zero padded OFDM transmissions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving channel estimation using a modified root selection algorithm with model order estimation in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Second National Radio Science Conference, 2005.

Two CCS-PRBG were used to design a chaotic key-dependent S-box for the AES encryption algorithm. The proposed S-box satisfies the strict avalanche criterion and the avalanche variable independence requirement. Large number of sequences that represent encrypted data using the AES encryption algorithm with chaotic key-dependent S-box have been tested using the NIST statistical tests. The proposed algorithm has been used to encrypt and decrypt an image. The encrypted image has been subjected to statistical analysis to demonstrate the confusion and diffusion properties by analyzing the histogram and correlations of pixels of the plain and ciphered image. The results indicate that the encrypted sequences have passed all NIST statistical tests.

In adaptive filtering, undetected noise bursts often disturb the adaptation and may lead to instabilities and divergence of the adaptive filter. The sensitivity against noise bursts increases with the convergence speed of the adaptive filter and limits the performance of signal processing methods where fast convergence is required. Typical applications which are sensitive against noise bursts are adaptive beamforming for audio signal acquisition or acoustic echo cancellation, where noise bursts are frequent due to undetected double-talk. In this paper, we apply double-talk resistant adaptive filtering (Gaensler (1998)) using a nonlinear optimization criterion to adaptive beamforming in the discrete Fourier transform domain for bin-wise adaptation controls. We show the efficiency of double-talk resilient adaptive filtering for a generalized sidelobe canceller for speech and audio signal acquisition. The improved robustness leads to faster convergence, to higher noise reduction, and to a better output signal quality in turn.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502235/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8531610","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502235/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of a double-talk resilient DFT domain adaptive filter for bin-wise stepsize controls to adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a double-talk resilient DFT domain adaptive filter for bin-wise stepsize controls to adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"01502235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037449S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10019","isNumber":"32163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10019","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"32163","articleId":"1502235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502336,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The optimal precoder varies with different correlation level and is evaluated with maximum likelihood detection and ZF-SIC detection schemes under different correlation scenarios.

Where required, it is also common to truncate the longer correlation to a sub-set of correlation coefficients by finding the set of N sequential correlation coefficients with the maximum power. This paper presents a new approach to selecting the optimal set of N CIR coefficients from the correlation rather than relying on power. The algorithm reconstructs a set of predicted symbols using the training sequence and various sub-sets of the correlation to find the sub-set that results in the minimum mean squared error between the actual received symbols and the reconstructed symbols. The application of the algorithm is presented in the context of the TDMA based GSM/GPRS system to demonstrate an improvement in the system performance with the new algorithm and the results are presented in the paper. However, the application lends itself to any training sequence based communication system often found within wireless consumer electronic device.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2005.1502372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Consumer Electronics, 2005.

In the receiver, at the same time, this system can not only combat severe dispersion effects of multipath propagation as the famous OFDM system does, but it is also insensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) due to the use of differential signalling. Such features make it a good candidate for asymmetrical communication applications, such as high-speed unidirectional wireless multimedia transmission or wireless sensor network (WSN) which require low cost and low power consumption.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Consumer Electronics, 2005.

The system used was the European digital video broadcast - terrestrial (DVB-T) but due to technological constraints at the time, the system chosen was the 2K system - a system that uses 1705 carriers to convey the digital television services through a hostile terrestrial environment. Today, these constraints are no longer applicable but in order to maintain backwards compatibility to the older set top boxes, the 2K system is still used. The 2K system has the disadvantage of excluding the possibility of employing a single frequency network (SFN) - something that can help minimise the required bandwidth for television services.

In this work a face-to-face bonding is utilized because it yields a higher density die-to-die interconnect than is possible with face-to-back. With sufficiently dense die-to-die interconnect, devices as complex as an iA32 microprocessor can be repartitioned or split between two die in order to simultaneously improve performance and power. The 3D structure of this emerging technology is examined and applied in this paper to a conventional 2D 32KB data cache. In this study, it is shown that a 3D implementation can potentially improve the silicon area, complexity, performance and power of a 2D circuit simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ICICDT.2005.1502578","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Integrated Circuit Design and Technology, 2005.

FinFET, a width-quantized, quasi-planar, double-gate technology, has emerged as the most likely candidate to replace classical technologies around the 45nm node. This paper studies the impact of FinFET design choices on device and SRAM circuit metrics to understand how its unique properties can be suitably harnessed. Width-quantization limits SRAM sizing choices, while quasi-planarity allows increased cell current by increasing fin height. Conversely, the latter property can be exploited to increase V/sub t/ and/or decrease V/sub dd/ to achieve exponential leakage savings at constant access time. The authors explored both approaches to selecting the right combination of device structure, V/sub t/ and V/sub dd/ that achieves maximum stability and minimum leakage over the design space. Increasing V/sub t/ with fin height and body thickness improves stability, decreases variability and decreases source-drain leakage exponentially. But this necessitates the use of small t/sub ox/ to control short channel effect; this increases gate leakage exponentially. On the other hand, increasing V/sub t/ and decreasing V/sub dd/ allows the use of larger t/sub ox/ to maintain short-channel effect and control gate leakage; however, this worsens stability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8540297","htmlLink":"/document/1502618/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","conferenceDate":"9-11 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Technology-circuit co-design in width-quantized quasi-planar double-gate SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology-circuit co-design in width-quantized quasi-planar double-gate SRAM","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"01502618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124604S","chronDate":"9-11 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10047","isNumber":"32240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10047","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32240","articleId":"1502618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1502621,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A prime reason is the lack of adhesion between Cu and epoxy compound. To solve the problem, self-assembly monolayer (SAM) is used to improve adhesion of copper-epoxy system. This paper focuses on simulation of adhesion in Cu-SAM-EMC system. In this study, molecular models of bi-material system, which consists of SAM and Cu, were built to evaluate the adhesion force of the Cu-SAM system. Interfacial energy density was derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The newly developed condensed phase optimization molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field enables prediction of adhesive strength of bi-material system in organic-metal oxide interface. The MD results were compared against shear load obtained from button shear tests. It has been illustrated that MD can provide a reasonable qualitatively prediction of the relative interfacial strength of the selected SAM samples. It is concluded that MD is an effective tool in screening SAM candidates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of adhesion properties of Cu-EMC interface by molecular dynamic simulation","publicationTitle":"EuroSimE 2005.

However, whenever the knowledge of the SOI steering vector is imprecise (as is often the case in practice), the performance of the Capon beamformer may become worse than that of the data-independent beamformer. Most of the early suggested robust adaptive methods are rather ad hoc in that the choice of their parameters are not directly related to the uncertainly of the steering vector. In this paper we provide a review of the recently proposed robust Capon beam-former (RCB) and doubly constrained robust Capon beamformer (DCRCB), which directly address the uncertainty of the steering vector and naturally extend the covariance fitting formulation of SCB to the case of uncertain steering vectors by enforcing a double constraint on the steering vector, viz. a constant norm constraint and an uncertainty set constraint. We also present several extensions and applications of RCB including constant-powerwidth RCB (CPRCB) and constant-beamwidth RCB (CBRCB) for acoustic imaging, rank-deficient robust Capon filter-bank (RCF) approach for spectral estimation, and rank-deficient RCB for landmine detection using forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) imaging systems. The excellent performances of RCB, DCRCB, and the various extensions of RCB are demonstrated by simulated and experimental examples.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502905","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502905.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502905","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Versatile robust Capon beamforming: theory and applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Versatile robust Capon beamforming: theory and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502905/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502905/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641670","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Versatile robust Capon beamforming: theory and applications","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062752S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1502906,"authors":[{"name":"C.

While the basic idea behind these algorithms is the same, namely the use of channel information at the transmitter to predict and then counteract the interference produced at each node in the network, each of the algorithms is based on achieving a different performance objective. We compare the various goals of the above algorithms, and detail their respective advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational complexity, required transmit power, network throughput, and assumed receiver capabilities. The results of several simulation studies are presented to quantify these comparisons.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502906","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","startPage":"43","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink transmit beamforming in multi-user MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink transmit beamforming in multi-user MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502906/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641671","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1502906/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink transmit beamforming in multi-user MIMO systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127044S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1502911,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Formerly, the authors proposed a 2-ch passive subtractive beamformer with a single sharp notch for noise reduction. It is obvious that the single sharp notch is insufficient for dealing with near-field, non-point sound sources. To solve this problem, this paper presents the hybrid subtractive beamformer that is realized as a cascade connection of single subtractive beamformers. The number of connections depends on frequency to minimize the negative effect caused by spatial aliasing when an objective signal is assumed as a wide-band speech signal. The experimental results verifies that the hybrid beamformer has an advantage in reducing signal distortion over the original single subtractive beamformer.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502911","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502911.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502911","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","startPage":"74","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive subtractive beamformer for near-field sound sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Passive subtractive beamformer for near-field sound sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502911/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641676","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive subtractive beamformer for near-field sound sources","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061405S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1502914,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, a large drop in output SINR occurs if the low-rank beamformer operates at an improper rank. Indirect dominant mode rejection (IDMR) is proposed wherein one first employs a high-resolution spatial spectrum estimation technique to estimate the directions and powers of the dominant interferers. Subsequently, this information is used to construct an estimate of the signal-free (interference plus noise only) autocorrelation matrix (for a given look-direction). In this process, any residual correlations between the interferers and the signal arriving from the look-direction due to finite sample averaging is effectively removed. Simulations reveal that IDMR yields a dramatic improvement in output SINR relative to CG and PCI/DMR, even when the latter operate at the optimal rank.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8641682","htmlLink":"/document/1502917/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming with low sample support via indirect dominant mode rejection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming with low sample support via indirect dominant mode rejection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045189S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502918,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Smart antennas are an efficient solution to reduce the interference level, thus increasing the number of users allowed in the system. The beamformer module of the adaptive antenna uses the information obtained from the array output to maximize the desired user's signal and minimize the interference's power, by properly combining the received signals. Typically, well-known adaptive algorithms are used to compute the optimum beamforming weights. An interesting alternative to traditional adaptive algorithms are artificial neural networks, specially for real-time implementation in a DSP. A digital beamformer based on a radial basis function neural network is presented in this paper, and its main features are studied. Its performance is compared to the results obtained with typical and optimal beamformers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8641685","htmlLink":"/document/1502920/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a neural network-based digital beamformer for a UMTS smart antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a neural network-based digital beamformer for a UMTS smart antenna","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056338S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502921,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

An exact analysis of the symbol error rate (SER) is presented for several alternative schemes: the standard Alamouti system without feedback as well as three different systems with one-bit feedback. Later schemes involve systems with transmit antenna selection, diagonal weighting, and power control at the transmitter. Our study shows that quite significant performance improvements can be obtained by exploiting one-bit feedback if it is (nearly) perfect. However, if the feedback is unreliable then the performance of the methods designed under the perfect feedback assumption deteriorates substantially and can be even worse than that of the standard Alamouti system without feedback. To improve the performance of the feedback-based schemes in the imperfect feedback case, we propose new robust modifications of the one-bit feedback-based Alamouti-type schemes. Thus robust technique takes the advantages of reliable feedback knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502925","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502925.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","startPage":"143","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alamouti-type wireless communication systems with one-bit feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Alamouti-type wireless communication systems with one-bit feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502925/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641690","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1502925/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alamouti-type wireless communication systems with one-bit feedback","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094545S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1502927,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Particularly, in multiple access systems with multiple transmit and receive antenna, many antenna selection algorithms that exploit instantaneous channel information have been presented in the literature. On the other hand, MAC protocols control the access to the channel by evaluating average performance parameters such as throughput and delay. Both approaches, namely PHY layer and MAC layer approaches, present advantages and drawbacks. Far from being competitive, we argue that such approaches are complementary. Therefore, we present a unified view of both, PHY and MAC layer visions for a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) multiple access channel. First, we evaluate the impact in terms of throughput of a PHY layer scheduling strategy. Second, a multipacket MAC algorithm is presented. Finally, we show the benefits of a PHY-MAC cross-layer optimization and present mathematical expressions to evaluate them. We also present our cross-layer design as an extension of multiuser diversity for the multi-user detector case.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502930","startPage":"168","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502930.pdf","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipacket MAC for multiple antenna systems: a cross-layer approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Multipacket MAC for multiple antenna systems: a cross-layer approach","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502930/","accessionNumber":"8641695","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502930/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipacket MAC for multiple antenna systems: a cross-layer approach","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043477S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1502934,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The major objective is the extraction of action potentials from neural data streams continuously acquired from a multi-electrode sensor array. For the actual detection process a wavelet-based method will be proposed, which allows efficient filtering as well as the definition of a robust threshold. In order to match the real time constraints for the wavelet transform an efficient and fast algorithm (lifting scheme) was used. An exemplary 8-channel implementation will be described exploiting the parallel potentials of a Xilinx Virtex field programmable gate array (FPGA).

We use a two stage protocol, where in one stage the transmitter sends information and in the other, the relay nodes encode their received signals into a \"distributed\" linear dispersion code, and then transmit the coded signals to the receiver. We show that for high SNR the pairwise error probability (PEP) behaves as (log P/P)/sup min{T,R}/ with T the coherence interval, R the number of relay nodes and P the total transmit power. Thus, apart from the log P factor and assuming T/spl ges/R, the system has the same diversity as a multi-antenna system with R transmit antennas, which is the same as assuming that the R relay nodes can fully cooperate and have full knowledge of the transmitted signal. We further show that for a fixed total transmit power across the entire network, the optimal power allocation is for the transmitter to expend half the power and for the relays to collectively expend the other half. We also show that at low and high SNR, the coding gain is the same as that of a multi-antenna system with R antennas. At intermediate SNR, it can be quite different, which has implications for the design of distributed space-time codes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","Intelligent networks","Relays","Power system relaying","Transmitters","Protocols","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Space technology","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","radio networks","radio transmitters","error statistics","diversity reception","antenna arrays","radio receivers","linear codes","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","multiple antenna system","wireless communication","relay network","protocol","transmitter","encoding","distributed linear dispersion code","receiver","pairwise error probability","PEP","diversity","transmitting antenna","power allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502947","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502947.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed space-time codes in wireless relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed space-time codes in wireless relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502947/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502947/","accessionNumber":"8641712","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed space-time codes in wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502947.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045873S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1502948,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper expands this approach in order to reduce the computational cost of the SVM solution by means of an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) procedure. The robustness of the proposed beam former is examined in several mismatch scenarios, showing a good performance even when the signal DOA mismatch error is underestimated: a situation where other robust approaches typically fail.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","startPage":"342","endPage":"346","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502966.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IRWLS procedure for robust beamforming with sidelobe control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1502966/","displayDocTitle":"An IRWLS procedure for robust beamforming with sidelobe control","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641731","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IRWLS procedure for robust beamforming with sidelobe control","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069839S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1502968,"authors":[{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Shefeng Yan","id":"37416582200"},{"name":"Yuanliang Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yuanliang Ma","id":"37274225800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8545-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1502968","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Noise robustness","Array signal processing","White noise","Acoustical engineering","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Performance gain","Covariance matrix","Acoustic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","white noise","statistical analysis","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supergain beamforming algorithm","circular array","endfire line array","sensor array","white noise gain constraint","WNC","random error","second-order cone programming","optimization"]}],"abstract":"The phenomenon of supergain for a circular array and its robust version are presented. The superdirective array gain for the circular array, although it is not so extreme as an endfire line array, outperforms a lot over that of a conventional beamformer in isotropic noise fields when the interelement spacings are less than one-half wavelength. However, optimum beamforming algorithms can be extremely sensitive to slight errors in array characteristics. The performance are known to degrade if some of underlying assumptions on the sensor array violated. Therefore white noise gain constraint (WNC) is used to increase the robustness of supergain beamforming against random errors. We show that the robust supergain beamforming can be reformulated in a form of second-order cone programming and resolved easily. Some computer simulations are also given to illustrate the presented approach.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502968","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502968.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502968","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","startPage":"352","endPage":"356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust supergain beamforming for circular array via second-order cone optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Robust supergain beamforming for circular array via second-order cone optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502968/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641733","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust supergain beamforming for circular array via second-order cone optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042049S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502969,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Although standard beamforming approaches are aimed at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), maximizing SINR does not guarantee a small mean-squared error (MSE), hence on average a signal estimate maximizing the SINR can be far from s(t). To ensure that s/spl I.cap/(t) is close to s(t), we propose using the more appropriate design criterion of MSE. Since the MSE depends in general on s(t) which is unknown, it cannot be minimized directly. Instead, we suggest two beamforming methods that minimize a worst-case measure of MSE. We first consider a minimax MSE beamformer that minimizes the worst-case MSE. We then consider a minimax regret beamformer that minimizes the worst-case difference between the MSE using a beamformer ignorant of s(t) and the smallest possible MSE attainable with a beamformer that knows s(t). We demonstrate through numerical examples that the proposed minimax methods outperform several existing standard and robust beamformers, over a wide range of SNR values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8641735","htmlLink":"/document/1502970/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Uniformly robust mean-squared error beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniformly robust mean-squared error beamforming","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064517S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1502973,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The so-obtained CSI can then be used in any coherent multiuser MIMO receiver.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502976","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","startPage":"392","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-blind MIMO channel estimation for space-time coded space-division multiple-access systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semi-blind MIMO channel estimation for space-time coded space-division multiple-access systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502976/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641741","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1502976/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-blind MIMO channel estimation for space-time coded space-division multiple-access systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075002S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1502977,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

These techniques include techniques based on deterministic modeling of the unknown symbols such as (signal and noise) subspace fitting methods, subchannel response matching (SRM), deterministic maximum likelihood (DML), and techniques based on a Gaussian white noise model for the unknown symbols such as Gaussian ML (GML) methods and covariance matching. The presence of a cyclic prefix transforms spatiotemporal channels into a set of parallel spatial channels, coupled by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the FIR channel impulse response. The associated blind channel estimation methods become computationally much more attractive and also become more straightforward to analyze and to compare in terms of performance. Working in the DFT domain reveals immediately that temporal whiteness of the additive noise is unessential, only spatial whiteness matters. Furthermore, the blind channel identifiability conditions become extremely weak when zero padded (ZP) systems are considered.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502978.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502978","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502978","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502978","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Channel estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Gaussian noise","Maximum likelihood estimation","White noise","Fourier transforms","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Blind equalizers","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","blind equalisers","transient response","AWGN channels","spatiotemporal phenomena","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite impulse response","blind FIR channel estimation","multichannel cyclic prefix system","communication system","subchannel response matching","SRM","deterministic maximum likelihood technique","DML modeling","Gaussian white noise model","spatiotemporal channel","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","additive noise","channel identifiability condition","zero padded system","ZP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502978/","displayDocTitle":"Blind FIR channel estimation in multichannel cyclic prefix systems","accessionNumber":"8641743","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1502978/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind FIR channel estimation in multichannel cyclic prefix systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049176S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1502979,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Such blind channel estimates, especially those based on subspaces in the data, are often only partial and ill-conditioned. On the other hand, in wireless communications the channel is typically modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e. with a Gaussian (prior) distribution expressing variances of and correlations between channel coefficients. In recent years, such prior information on the channel has started to get exploited in pilot-based channel estimation, since often (as e.g. in 3G WCDM A systems) the pure pilot-based (deterministic) channel estimate is of limited quality. The fading in wireless communications leads indeed often to a poor data to parameter ratio. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian approach to (semi-)blind channel estimation, exploiting a priori information on fading channels. Two case can be considered, either given prior information or joint estimation of channel and prior. In the second case there are still identifiability issues whereas in the first case there are typically none. However, the identifiability issues can be resolved with a reduced amount of training in a semiblind approach. Various models/parameterizations for the channel correlation structure and the fading process can be considered.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502981.pdf","endPage":"421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian blind and semiblind channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502981","startPage":"417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian blind and semiblind channel estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502981/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8641746","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1502981/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian blind and semiblind channel estimation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045355S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1502984,"authors":[{"name":"Chong-Yung Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chong-Yung Chi","id":"37267801400"},{"name":"Chun-Hsien Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-Hsien Peng","id":"37278385900"},{"name":"Wang-Da Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wang-Da Li","id":"37558026600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8545-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1502984","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"abstract":"With a given set of multichannel measurements of instantaneous mixture of multiple sources, some blind source separation (BSS) algorithms including the fast kurtosis maximization algorithm (FKMA) and turbo source separation algorithm (TSSA) proposed by Chi et al., can only extract one source signal and the associated column of the mixing matrix A.

Unlike the usual \"blind\" isotropic broadcasting scenario, the availability of CSI allows transmit optimization. We adopt a minimum transmission power criterion, subject to prescribed minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each of the intended receivers. We also consider a related max-min SNR \"fair\" problem formulation subject to a transmit power constraint. The basic problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve; however, we show that a suitable reformulation allows the application of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. SDR yields a (generally approximate) solution, but in many cases our solution is optimal, and in most cases it is within 3-4 dB from the optimal solution, which is often good enough in our intended applications. While the focus of the paper is on a wireless communication scenario, we also discuss related problems in downstream preceding for broadcasting in digital subscriber line systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcasting with channel state information","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1502996","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01502996.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1502996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1502996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1502996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Broadcasting with channel state information","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1502996/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641761","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcasting with channel state information","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01502996.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049735S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1502996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1503001,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The cut-off rate has been considered for a long time as the practical bound on the performance that could be achieved by feasible codes, providing an exponential upper bound on the error probability for the average over the ensemble of codes with block length N. A Bayesian formulation is used to design an optimal transmitter based on noisy CSI estimates.

Furthermore, the degree of angular spread is also evaluated by using these estimated parameters.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1503017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1503017","startPage":"589","endPage":"593","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01503017.pdf","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for spatially non-symmetric distributed sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for spatially non-symmetric distributed sources","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503017/","accessionNumber":"8641782","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-arrival estimation for spatially non-symmetric distributed sources","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01503017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043773S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1503017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1503024,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We consider the use of antenna arrays at the base station (BS) and present different pre-filtering schemes for two different receiver configurations at the mobile terminal: a simple despreading receiver without channel equalization and an EGC conventional receiver. We show that the space-frequency pre-filtering approaches proposed allow to format the transmitted signals so that the multiple access interference at mobile terminals is reduced allowing to transfer the most computational complexity from mobile terminal (MT) to the base station. One important issue for all pre-filtering scheme is that their effectiveness relies on the accuracy of the uplink channel estimates in modeling the downlink channel. Therefore, we evaluate the performance of both schemes in scenarios where the channel changes between an uplink and downlink slot, in order to obtain the performance penalties as a function of the lime separation between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) slots.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1503035","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01503035.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1503035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of space-frequency pre-filtering schemes for downlink TDD MC-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1503035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503035/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of space-frequency pre-filtering schemes for downlink TDD MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641800","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503035/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of space-frequency pre-filtering schemes for downlink TDD MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01503035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077613S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1503035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1503036,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

In this paper we focus on the systems with optimal precoder designs based on the minimization of bit error rate (BER) which is the more meaningful criterion in data communications. The linear receivers employed in these systems include zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers. Recently, block decision feedback equalization (DFE) has also been suggested to be used in the design of such block data transmission systems. We also revisit the jointly optimum designs of the precoder coupled with the DFE receivers. First we derive the block-data error rate for all of these different systems with their corresponding optimal precoders. Then we rank their performance accordingly. Simulation results are also obtained to verify our analysis. Later, we evaluate the computational complexity on the various systems and draw some conclusions on their relative merits.

This problem is solved by a two-stage optimization procedure in which a lower bound on the BER is first minimized, followed by showing that this lower bound is actually achieved by the solution obtained in the first stage. In the first stage, we can transform the formulation of the original non-convex optimization problem into a convex one by optimally allocating the subcarriers based on the largest subchannel gain.

We also provide some analysis using measured data to demonstrate the gain in coordinating large number of pairs.","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1503039","startPage":"696","endPage":"700","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01503039.pdf","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1503039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of next limited multichannel DSL","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Crosstalk","AWGN","Additive white noise","Signal analysis","Data analysis","Gain measurement","Ethernet networks","Power cables","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","digital subscriber lines","crosstalk","statistical analysis","matrix algebra","Gaussian channels","multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","multipair DSL system","digital subscriber line","crosstalk","statistical model","cross spectral matrix","multiple Gaussian interfering signal","data measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of next limited multichannel DSL","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503039/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","accessionNumber":"8641804","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of next limited multichannel DSL","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01503039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033698S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1503039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1503040,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper linear precoding, which combats the effects of antenna correlation, is applied to orthogonal space-time block coded systems with two transmit antennas. The precoding technique exploits the knowledge of the long-term characteristics of the channel, namely the channel correlation matrix at the transmitter. For low antenna correlation values the proposed technique is equivalent to space-time block coding, whereas for high correlation values it is proved to be equivalent to beamforming. For intermediate antenna correlation values the proposed technique outperforms both schemes. The sensitivity of the proposed precoding technique to channel state information errors at the transmitter is also investigated and its robustness is demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Fading","MIMO","Block codes","Channel state information","Adaptive arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitting antennas","correlation methods","space-time codes","block codes","channel coding","matrix algebra","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna correlation","linear precoding","orthogonal space-time block coded system","transmitting antenna","long-term characteristic","channel correlation matrix","transmitter","beamforming","channel state information"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1503040","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01503040.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1503040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust linear precoding to compensate for antenna correlation in orthogonal space-time block coded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1503040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust linear precoding to compensate for antenna correlation in orthogonal space-time block coded systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503040/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503040/","accessionNumber":"8641805","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust linear precoding to compensate for antenna correlation in orthogonal space-time block coded systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01503040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060435S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1503040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1503041,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Since a global optimization might not be solvable in real time, the AP has several alternatives involving both the physical layer, e.g. beam-forming and power/bit allocation, and the DLC, such as scheduling. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, for K/spl les/Q we compare traditional bit allocation strategies with a novel modified approach, especially in terms of fairness. Second, we focus on the combinatorial problem that arises when K>Q, and propose several alternatives for the scheduling of the users into groups, which is done together with the bit allocation. Simulations show that better performance is obtained at the expense of complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser spatial scheduling in the downlink of wireless systems","publicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","doi":"10.1109/SAM.2004.1503041","displayPublicationTitle":"Processing Workshop Proceedings, 2004 Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal","pdfPath":"/iel5/10049/32242/01503041.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAM.2004.1503041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1503041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2004","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser spatial scheduling in the downlink of wireless systems","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503041/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8641806","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser spatial scheduling in the downlink of wireless systems","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01503041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069429S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10049","isNumber":"32242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10049","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"32242","articleId":"1503041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1503164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper presents a semantic genetic algorithm (SGA) to learn a complete qualitative structure of a Bayesian network from a database. SGA builds on recent advances in the field and focuses on the generation of initial population, crossover, and mutation operators. Particularly, we introduce two semantic crossover and mutation operators that aid in faster convergence of the SGA. The crossover and mutation operators in SGA incorporate the semantic of the Bayesian network structures to learn the structure with very minimal errors. SGA has been proved to perform better than existing classical genetic algorithms for learning Bayesian networks.

On the other hand, with the rapid rise in link speeds, collecting all packets has become difficult, so packet sampling has been attracting attention as a scalable means of measuring flow statistics. We have therefore established a method of detecting performance degradation at the TCP flow level from sampled flow behaviors. The proposed method is based on the following two flow characteristics: (i) sampled flows tend to have high flow-rates and (ii) when a link becomes congested, the performance of high-rate flows becomes degraded first. These characteristics indicate that sampled flows are sensitive to congestion, so we can detect performance degradation of flows that are sensitive to congestion by observing the rate of sampled flows. We also show the effectiveness of our method using measured data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Telecommunication traffic","Fluid flow measurement","Sampling methods","Velocity measurement","Statistics","Laboratories","IP networks","Power measurement","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transport protocols","telecommunication links","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance degradation detection","TCP flow level","sampled packet stream","traffic measurement","network management","packet sampling","flow statistics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HPSR.2005.1503214","publicationTitle":"HPSR. 2005 Workshop on High Performance Switching and Routing, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"HPSR. 2005 Workshop on High Performance Switching and Routing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10052/32245/01503214.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPSR.2005.1503214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of detecting performance degradation at TCP flow level from sampled packet streams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1503214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A method of detecting performance degradation at TCP flow level from sampled packet streams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503214/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503214/","accessionNumber":"8642533","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of detecting performance degradation at TCP flow level from sampled packet streams","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01503214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06519S","chronDate":"12-14 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10052","isNumber":"32245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10052","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32245","articleId":"1503214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1503230,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Ming Hu","id":"37276787700"},{"name":"Junshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Junshan Zhang","id":"37066444600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8924-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-5552"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-5560"}],"articleNumber":"1503230","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Media Access Protocol","Routing","Intelligent networks","Ad hoc networks","Throughput","Delay","Mobile ad hoc networks","Fading","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","access protocols","routing protocols","ad hoc networks","mobile radio","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO medium access control","network routing","mobile ad hoc network","spatial diversity","end-to-end delay","hop distance"]}],"abstract":"We explore joint design of MIMO medium access control (MAC) and routing in mobile ad hoc networks using spatial diversity.

Sparse sample processing is used, as the echo signal for the image lines is reconstructed in 512 equidistant focal points along the line through its in-phase and quadrature components. That information is sufficient for presenting a B-mode image and creating a color flow map. The high sampling rate provides the necessary delay resolution for the focusing. The low channel data width (1-bit) makes it possible to construct a compact beamformer logic. The signal reconstruction is done using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, applied on selected bit sequences of the delta-sigma modulator output stream. The approach allows for a multichannel beamformer to fit in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. A 32-channel beamformer is estimated to occupy 50% of the available logic resources in a commercially available midrange FPGA, and to be able to operate at 129 MHz. Simulation of the architecture at 140 MHz provides images with a dynamic range approaching 60 dB for an excitation frequency of 3 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/32255/01503973.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2005","displayDocTitle":"Compact FPGA-based beamformer using oversampled 1-bit A/D converters","volume":"52","issue":"5","pubMedId":"16048188","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8501685","htmlLink":"/document/1503973/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"May 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact FPGA-based beamformer using oversampled 1-bit A/D converters","sourcePdf":"1503973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073549S","chronDate":"May  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"32255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"32255","articleId":"1503973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1503974,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The architecture of these systems is therefore also sequential in nature and processes most of the data in a sequential pipeline. This often makes it difficult to implement radically different imaging strategies on the platforms and makes the scanners less accessible for research purposes. A system designed for imaging research flexibility is the prime concern. The possibility of sending out arbitrary signals and the storage of data from all transducer elements for 5 to 10 seconds allows clinical evaluation of synthetic aperture and 3D imaging. This paper describes a real-time system specifically designed for research purposes. The system can acquire multichannel data in real-time from multi-element ultrasound transducers, and can perform some real-time processing on the acquired data. The system is capable of performing real-time beamforming for conventional imaging methods using linear, phased, and convex arrays. Image acquisition modes can be intermixed, and this makes it possible to perform initial trials in a clinical environment with new imaging modalities for synthetic aperture imaging, 2D and 3D B-mode, and velocity imaging using advanced coded emissions. The system can be used with 128-element transducers and can excite 128 transducer elements and receive and sample data from 64 channels simultaneously at 40 MHz with 12-bit precision. Two-to-one multiplexing in receive can be used to cover 128 receive channels. Data can be beamformed in real time using the system's 80 signal processing units, or it can be stored directly in RAM. The system has 16 Gbytes RAM and can, thus, store more than 3.4 seconds of multichannel data. It is fully software programmable and its signal processing units can also be reconfigured under software control. The control of the system is done over a 100-Mbits/s Ethernet using C and Matlab. Programs for doing, e.g., B-mode imaging can be written directly in Matlab and executed on the system over the net from any workstation running Matlab. The overall system concept is presented along with its implementation and examples of B-mode and in vivo synthetic aperture flow imaging.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32255","startPage":"881","endPage":"891","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/32255/01503974.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound research scanner for real-time synthetic aperture data acquisition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1503974/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound research scanner for real-time synthetic aperture data acquisition","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2005","accessionNumber":"8517349","pubMedId":"16048189","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound research scanner for real-time synthetic aperture data acquisition","sourcePdf":"1503974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086633S","chronDate":"May  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"32255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"32255","articleId":"1503974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1503999,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Adaptive imaging improves contrast and resolution by compensating for tissue-induced phase errors. Aberrator strength and spatial frequency content markedly impact the desirable operating characteristics and performance of these methods for improving image quality. Adaptive imaging, receive-spatial compounding, and a combination of these two methods are presented in contrast and resolution tasks under various aberration characteristics. All three imaging methods yield increases in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of anechoic cysts; however, the improvements vary depending on the properties of the aberrating layer. Phase correction restores image spatial frequencies, and the addition of compounding opposes the restoration of image spatial frequencies. Lesion signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), an image quality metric for predicting lesion detectability, shows that combining spatial compounding with phase correction yields the maximum detectability when the aberrator strength or spatial frequency content is high. Examples of these modes are presented in thyroid tissue.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/32256/01503999.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1503999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive imaging and spatial compounding in the presence of aberration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1503999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1503999/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive imaging and spatial compounding in the presence of aberration","volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8545650","pubMedId":"16212252","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1503999/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive imaging and spatial compounding in the presence of aberration","sourcePdf":"1503999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091539S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"32256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"32256","articleId":"1503999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504048,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Mei Wang","affiliation":["College of Logistics, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, china"],"lastName":"Shao-Mei Wang","id":"37087540856"},{"name":"Wen-Bin Hu","affiliation":["College of computer science and technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, china"],"lastName":"Wen-Bin Hu","id":"37087536436"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-84600-002-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1504048","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Product design","Logistics","Computer science","Collaboration","Costs","Manufacturing","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groupware","CAD","negotiation support systems","genetic algorithms","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilateral negotiation algorithm","cooperative design system","genetic algorithm","conflict problem","Pareto solution","scalar-optimal problems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504048","abstract":"The negotiation of conflict problem in the cooperation design system was studied from the view of solving negotiation problems.

Two new features are proposed to capture model surface orientation information. In the method, each model class is represented by four HMMs corresponding to four type features. During the training process, for each type of feature, the feature statistics of each model class and the spatial dynamics are learned by an HMM. During the classification process, characteristics of the test model are analyzed by the HMMs corresponding to each model class. The likelihood scores provided by the HMMs are calculated, and the highest weighted sum score provides the class identification of the test model. Furthermore, with unsupervised learning, each HMM and type weight are adapted with test models, which results in better modeling over time. Based on experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves much better performance than a baseline method and better performance than HMMs using only two features with fixed weights method.","doi":"10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194236","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10055/32248/01504143.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"581 Vol. 1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-weighted hidden Markov models based 3D model classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504143/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-weighted hidden Markov models based 3D model classification","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8605150","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504143/","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-weighted hidden Markov models based 3D model classification","confLoc":"Coventry, UK","sourcePdf":"01504143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048891S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10055","isNumber":"32248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10055","xplore-issue":"32248","articleId":"1504143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Coventry University","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1504208,"authors":[{"name":"Zhimin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science of Shandong, University of Weihai, China"],"lastName":"Zhimin Yang","id":"37087283340"},{"name":"Xiumei Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science of Shandong, University of Weihai, China"],"lastName":"Xiumei Wei","id":"37087809554"},{"name":"Luyan Bi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science of Shandong, University of Weihai, China"],"lastName":"Luyan Bi","id":"37087599369"},{"name":"Dongping Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science of Shandong, University of Weihai, China"],"lastName":"Dongping Shi","id":"37087256590"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science of Shandong, University of Weihai, China"],"lastName":"Hui Li","id":"37089130770"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-84600-002-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1504208","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504208","abstract":"Based on the information system of Shanhua Company, this paper discusses the structure and function of intrusion detection system based on RBF, the steps and method of intrusion detection.

This method consists of two parts: one is a communication-centric framework for the simulation system mapped onto FPGA. The other is the establishment of the module library. While a modification should be made to the simulation requirements, the designer simply selects required modules from the library and their replaces the unneeded modules only with few alterations to the platform. So, the design speed can be accelerated.

Finally, a parallel BCH (2184, 2040) encoder with 8-bit parallelism is realized in TSMC's 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology for high-speed optical communication that can operate at 400 MHz and process data at the rate of 2.5 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504560","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE International Workshop on VLSI Design and Video Technology, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE International Workshop on VLSI Design and Video Technology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10054/32247/01504560.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized design for high-speed parallel BCH encoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized design for high-speed parallel BCH encoder","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8634267","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504560/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2005","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized design for high-speed parallel BCH encoder","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"01504560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060587S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10054","isNumber":"32247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10054","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32247","articleId":"1504560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504567,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Xia Han","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Li-Xia Han","id":"37554786600"},{"name":"Yuping Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Yuping Wang","id":"37293653000"},{"name":"Fu-Ying Guo","affiliation":["Computer Basic Teaching and Experiment Center, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Fu-Ying Guo","id":"37548868500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9005-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1504567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"abstract":"A novel genetic algorithm for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree (d-MST) is proposed in this paper.

The beamforming processing is done classically by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the desired signals and actual array outputs. The MSE beamformer, which uses only second-order statistics, can provide good performance and can readily be implemented usually. However, the transmission performance of the MSE beamformer degrades under severe channel, such as strong interference condition or severe noise. In this paper, the minimum entropy beamformer that considers all the higher order statistics of the error is proposed. Simulation results show that proposed beamforming technique can reach lower BER compared to the minimum MSE beamforming technique under severe channel. Furthermore, the minimum entropy beamformer can provide fast convergence and is adequate for next generation of wireless communication.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32247","startPage":"252","endPage":"255","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE International Workshop on VLSI Design and Video Technology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10054/32247/01504598.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive minimum entropy beamformer for wireless communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504598/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive minimum entropy beamformer for wireless communication","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8634270","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive minimum entropy beamformer for wireless communication","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"01504598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034023S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10054","isNumber":"32247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10054","xplore-issue":"32247","articleId":"1504598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1504604,"authors":[{"name":"Kongfeng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shangdong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Kongfeng Zhu","id":"37087304727"},{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shangdong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Wei Jiang","id":"37089048175"},{"name":"Duanfang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shangdong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Duanfang Wang","id":"37087528394"},{"name":"Xian Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shangdong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Xian Zhou","id":"37087257591"},{"name":"Jin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shangdong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Jin Zhang","id":"37087149804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9005-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1504604","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"In automatic focusing system, the focusing window directly affects the speed and veracity of auto focusing.

The clustered result by the implemented chip is then sent to an AHC (adaptive heuristic critic) architecture (emulated by a personal computer) to learn to balance an inverted pendulum system, which is also emulated by the personal computer for verifying the implemented architecture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Neurons","Computer architecture","Microcomputers","Network topology","Resonance","Subspace constraints","Unsupervised learning","Neural networks","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","self-adjusting systems","pendulums","microcomputers","field programmable gate arrays","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","reinforcement learning algorithm","flexible adaptable-size topology","adaptive resonance theory","self organizing architecture","adaptive heuristic critic architecture","inverted pendulum system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504643","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE International Workshop on VLSI Design and Video Technology, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE International Workshop on VLSI Design and Video Technology, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10054/32247/01504643.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of FAST-based reinforcement learning algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of FAST-based reinforcement learning algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504643/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504643/","accessionNumber":"8642911","conferenceDate":"28-30 May 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 May 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of FAST-based reinforcement learning algorithm","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"01504643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06447S","chronDate":"28-30 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10054","isNumber":"32247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10054","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32247","articleId":"1504643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1504661,"authors":[{"name":"B.

They find that on small, stand-alone projects, agile practices are less burdensome and more in tune with the software industry's increasing needs for rapid development and coping with continuous change. Managers face several barriers, real and perceived, when they try to bring agile approaches into traditional organizations. They categorized the barriers either as problems only in terms of scope or scale, or as significant general issues needing resolution. From these two categories, we've identified three areas - development process conflicts, business process conflicts, and people conflicts - that we believe are the critical challenges to software managers of large organizations in bringing agile approaches to bear in their projects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504661/","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1504661/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8592017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Management challenges to implementing agile processes in traditional development organizations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Management challenges to implementing agile processes in traditional development organizations","sourcePdf":"01504661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080889S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"52","isNumber":"32260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"32260","articleId":"1504661","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504688,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In particular, the problem can be made more tractable by deliberately using algorithms that are biased toward solutions of the requisite kind. In this paper, we argue that recurrent neural networks have a natural bias toward a problem domain of which biological sequence analysis tasks are a subset. We use experiments with synthetic data to illustrate this bias. We then demonstrate that this bias can be exploitable using a data set of protein sequences containing several classes of subcellular localization targeting peptides. The results show that, compared with feed forward, recurrent neural networks will generally perform better on sequence analysis tasks. Furthermore, as the patterns within the sequence become more ambiguous, the choice of specific recurrent architecture becomes more critical.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504688/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","volume":"2","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8609754","pubMedId":"17044187","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504688/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The applicability of recurrent neural networks for biological sequence analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The applicability of recurrent neural networks for biological sequence analysis","sourcePdf":"01504688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066961S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"32261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"32261","articleId":"1504688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1504696,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The log-distance model of the normalized received power (NRP) is used to fit the measured data for both line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) cases. Also, the impact of the biconical antennas and the reflective environment on the channel properties is analyzed and explained. Results show that the most favorable NRP values are found in the case that the Tx and Rx antennas are at the same height. Also, in most cases, the scatter paths have more contributions on the total received power than the direct path. In addition, in the LOS case, the NRPs become less dependent on the Tx-Rx separation owing to the combined effect of the antenna and the reflective environment. In the NLOS region, the contribution level of the strongest path becomes less dominant with increasing virtual Tx-Rx separation. The analysis of these results can be instructive for the deployment of a 60-GHz system in a reflective environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of antenna pattern and reflective environment on 60 GHz indoor radio channel characteristics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2005.855635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/30362/01504697.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2005.855635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=30362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"Impact of antenna pattern and reflective environment on 60 GHz indoor radio channel characteristics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8685948","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of antenna pattern and reflective environment on 60 GHz indoor radio channel characteristics","sourcePdf":"01504697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024775S","chronDate":"2005","isNumber":"30362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"23","articleId":"1504697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504699,"authors":[{"name":"Qinjiang Rao","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Qinjiang Rao","id":"37087148813"},{"name":"T.A.

Through the augmented reality interface, the operator can monitor real-time changes of the nanoenvironment during nanomanipulation through a movie-like AFM image. In this paper, the behavior of some nanowires under pushing is theoretically analyzed and the interaction among the tip, substrate, and nanowires has been modeled. Based on these models, the real-time interactive forces can be used to locally update the AFM image in order to obtain movie-like visual feedback in video frame rate.

The theory of optimal experiments is applied to adaptively optimize the sequence of target-sensor orientations considered. This is motivated by the fact that if fewer, better-chosen measurements are used then targets can be recognized more accurately with less time and expense. Specifically, based on the previous sequence of observations O/sub t/={O/sub 1/,...,O/sub t/}, the technique determines what change in relative target-sensor orientation /spl Delta//spl theta//sub t+1/ is optimal for performing measurement t+1, to yield observation O/sub t+1/. The target is assumed distant or hidden, and, therefore, the absolute target-sensor orientation is unknown.

However, taking real-time traffic data and transforming them into optimal route decisions are a computational challenge. This is in a large part due to the amount of data available that could be valuable in the route selection. The authors model the dynamic route determination problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and present procedures for identifying traffic data having no decision-making value. Such identification can be used to reduce the state space of the MDP, thereby improving its computational tractability. This reduction can be achieved by a two-step process. The first is an a priori reduction that may be performed using a stationary deterministic network with upper and lower bounds on the cost functions before the trip begins. The second part of the process reduces the state space further on the nonstationary stochastic road network as the trip optimally progresses. The authors demonstrate the potential computational advantages of the introduced methods based on actual data collected on a road network in southeast Michigan.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/32264/01504787.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2005.853695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2005.853695","startPage":"273","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State space reduction for nonstationary stochastic shortest path problems with real-time traffic information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504787/","displayDocTitle":"State space reduction for nonstationary stochastic shortest path problems with real-time traffic information","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504787/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8567697","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State space reduction for nonstationary stochastic shortest path problems with real-time traffic information","sourcePdf":"01504787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093483S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"32264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"32264","articleId":"1504787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504791,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The accuracy of a traffic-simulation system depends highly on the quality of the traffic-flow model at its core, with the two main critical components being the car-following and lane-changing models. This paper presents findings from a comparative evaluation of car-following behavior in a number of traffic simulators [advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN), parallel microscopic simulation (PARAMICS), and Verkehr in Stadten-simulation (VISSIM)]. The car-following algorithms used in these simulators have been developed from a variety of theoretical backgrounds and are reported to have been calibrated on a number of different data sets. Very few independent studies have attempted to evaluate the performance of the underlying algorithms based on the same data set. The results reported in this study are based on a car-following experiment that used instrumented vehicles to record the speed and relative distance between follower and leader vehicles on a one-lane road. The experiment was replicated in each tool and the simulated car-following behavior was compared to the field data using a number of error tests. The results showed lower error values for the Gipps-based models implemented in AIMSUN and similar error values for the psychophysical spacing models used in VISSIM and PARAMICS. A qualitative \"drift and goal-seeking behavior\" test, which essentially shows how the distance headway between leader and follower vehicles should oscillate around a stable distance, also confirmed the findings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/32264/01504791.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2005.853705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2005.853705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative evaluation of microscopic car-following behavior","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microscopy","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Road vehicles","Testing","Intelligent systems","Vehicle dynamics","Analytical models","Instruments","Psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic engineering computing","knowledge based systems","automobiles","road traffic","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microscopic car-following behavior","microscopic traffic-simulation tools","intelligent transport systems","lane-changing models","advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks","parallel microscopic simulation","Verkehr in Stadten","Gipps-based models","psychophysical spacing models","qualitative drift and goal-seeking behavior test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Car-following models","microscopic traffic simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Comparative evaluation of microscopic car-following behavior","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1504791/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567701","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative evaluation of microscopic car-following behavior","sourcePdf":"01504791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073785S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"32264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"32264","articleId":"1504791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504800,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The system is based on a textile wearable interface implemented by integrating sensors, electrodes, and connections in fabric form, advanced signal processing techniques, and modern telecommunication systems. Sensors, electrodes and connections are realized with conductive and piezoresistive yarns. The sensorized knitted fabric is produced in a one step process. The purpose of this paper is to show the feasibility of a system based on fabric sensing elements. The capability of this system to acquire simultaneously several biomedical signals (i.e. electrocardiogram, respiration, activity) has been investigated and compared with a standard monitoring system. Furthermore, the paper presents two different methodologies for the acquisition of the respiratory signal with textile sensors. Results show that the information contained in the signals obtained by the integrated systems is comparable with that obtained by standard sensors. The proposed system is designed to monitor individuals affected by cardiovascular diseases, in particular during the rehabilitation phase. The system can also help professional workers who are subject to considerable physical and psychological stress and/or environmental and professional health risks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/32265/01504803.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2005.854512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2005.854512","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504803/","displayDocTitle":"A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504803/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8567892","pubMedId":"16167687","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors","sourcePdf":"01504803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044032S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"464","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504804,"authors":[{"name":"Enzo Pasquale Scilingo","affiliation":["Interdepartmental Research Center E.

Truly wearable instrumented garments capable of recording behavioral and vital signals are crucial for several fields of application. Here we report on results of a careful characterization of the performance of innovative fabric sensors and electrodes able to acquire vital biomechanical and physiological signals, respectively. The sensing function of the fabric sensors relies upon newly developed strain sensors, based on rubber-carbon-coated threads, and mainly depends on the weaving topology, and the composition and deposition process of the conducting rubber-carbon mixture. Fabric sensors are used to acquire the respitrace (RT) and movement sensors (MS). Sensing features of electrodes, instead rely upon metal-based conductive threads, which are instrumental in detecting bioelectrical signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG). Fabric sensors have been tested during some specific tasks of breathing and movement activity, and results have been compared with the responses of a commercial piezoelectric sensor and an electrogoniometer, respectively. The performance of fabric electrodes has been investigated and compared with standard clinical electrodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","volume":"9","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"8567893","pubMedId":"16167688","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504804/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of sensing fabrics for monitoring physiological and biomechanical variables","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of sensing fabrics for monitoring physiological and biomechanical variables","sourcePdf":"01504804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059546S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1504806,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchu Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/32265/1504806/1504806-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianchu Yao (S'01) was born in Hunan, China, in 1971.

Reconfigurability, interoperability, and scalability are important. Standardization supports these requirements, and encourages an open market where lower product prices result from vendor competition. This paper first discusses candidate standards for wireless communication, plug-and-play device interoperability, and medical information exchange in point-of-care systems. It then addresses the design and implementation of a wearable, plug-and-play system for home care which adopts the IEEE 1073 Medical Information Bus (MIB) standards, and uses Bluetooth as the wireless communication protocol. This standards-based system maximizes user mobility by incorporating a three-level architecture populated by base stations, wearable data loggers, and wearable sensors. Design issues include the implementation of the MIB standards on microcontroller-driven embedded devices, low power consumption, wireless data exchange, and data storage and transmission in a reconfigurable body-area network.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2005.854507","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/32265/01504806.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2005.854507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","startPage":"363","endPage":"371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wearable point-of-care system for home use that incorporates plug-and-play and wireless standards","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"A wearable point-of-care system for home use that incorporates plug-and-play and wireless standards","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504806/","volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1504806/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567895","pubMedId":"16167690","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wearable point-of-care system for home use that incorporates plug-and-play and wireless standards","sourcePdf":"01504806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087534S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1504807,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A particular conductive mixture based on commercial products is realized and directly spread over a piece of fabric, which shows, after the treatment, piezoresistive properties, i.e., a change in resistance when it is strained. This property is exploited to realize sensorized garments such as gloves, leotards, and seat covers capable of reconstructing and monitoring body shape, posture, and gesture. In general, this technology is a good candidate for adherent wearable systems with excellent mechanical coupling with body surface. Here, we mainly focused on a sensorized glove able to detect posture and movements of the fingers. It could be used in several fields of application. We report on experimental results of a sensorized glove used as movements recorder for rehabilitation therapies and medicine. Furthermore, we describe a dedicated methodology used to read the output sensors which allowed to avoid using metallic wires for the connections. The price to be paid for all these advantages is a nonlinear electric response of the fabric sensor and a too long settling time, that in principle, make these sensors not suitable for real-time applications. Here we propose a hardware and computational solution to overcome this limitation.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2005.854510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/32265/01504807.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2005.854510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strain sensing fabric for hand posture and gesture monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504807/","displayDocTitle":"Strain sensing fabric for hand posture and gesture monitoring","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567896","pubMedId":"16167691","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504807/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strain sensing fabric for hand posture and gesture monitoring","sourcePdf":"01504807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069972S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504808,"authors":[{"name":"C.W.

Unfortunately, MR images always contain a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, equipment, and the environment, which can lead to serious inaccuracies with segmentation. A robust segmentation technique based on an extension to the traditional fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. A neighborhood attraction, which is dependent on the relative location and features of neighboring pixels, is shown to improve the segmentation performance dramatically. The degree of attraction is optimized by a neural-network model. Simulated and real brain MR images with different noise levels are segmented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique compared to other FCM-based methods. This segmentation method is a key component of an MR image-based classification system for brain tumors, currently being developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8567905","htmlLink":"/document/1504816/","pubMedId":"16167700","displayDocTitle":"MRI fuzzy segmentation of brain tissue using neighborhood attraction with neural-network optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRI fuzzy segmentation of brain tissue using neighborhood attraction with neural-network optimization","sourcePdf":"01504816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094033S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":1504817,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Efficient utilization of this dwindling resource is a critical problem if hospitals are to maximize patient care while minimizing costs.

Rapid assessment in the emergency room (ER) necessarily limits the amount of usable information available (with respect to independent variables available). This study evaluates the efficacy of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the transfusion requirements of trauma patients using readily available information. A total of 1016 patient records are used to train and test a backpropagation neural network for predicting the transfusion requirements of these patients during the first 2, 2-6, and 6-24 h, and for total transfusions. Sensitivity and specificity analysis are used along with the mean absolute difference between blood units predicted and units transfused to demonstrate that ANNs can accurately predict most ER patient transfusion requirements, while only using information available at the time of entry into the ER.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2005.847510","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/32265/01504817.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2005.847510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network medical decision support tool: predicting transfusion requirements of ER patients","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network medical decision support tool: predicting transfusion requirements of ER patients","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8567906","pubMedId":"16167701","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504817/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network medical decision support tool: predicting transfusion requirements of ER patients","sourcePdf":"01504817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108535S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"32265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"32265","articleId":"1504817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":1504824,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Specifications for MIPEC designing come out from many considerations concerning traction drive and reference driving cycle, on-board power source and storage unit characteristics. However, to date sizing and configuration of both storage units and on-board generators are directly related to traction drive and driving profile (i.e., vehicle performances and characteristics) and no relation with power electronic interface is considered during preliminary design. Then, power electronic interface is selected in order to fit traction drive requirements with power source and storage unit characteristics; as a consequence converter mode of operation lacks of optimization, as well dynamic behavior and efficiency cannot be maximized. In this paper, MIPEC design and power source and storage unit selection are achieved at the same project stage according to traction drive requirements.

In the proposed strategy, a coupled inductor with a lower-voltage-rated switch is used for raising the voltage gain (whether the switch is turned on or turned off). Moreover, a passive regenerative snubber is utilized for absorbing the energy of stray inductance so that the switch duty cycle can be operated under a wide range, and the related voltage gain is higher than other coupled-inductor-based converters. In addition, all devices in this scheme also have voltage-clamped properties and their voltage stresses are relatively smaller than the output voltage. Thus, it can select low-voltage low-conduction-loss devices, and there are no reverse-recovery currents within the diodes in this circuit. Furthermore, the closed-loop control methodology is utilized in the proposed scheme to overcome the voltage drift problem of the power source under the load variations. As a result, the proposed converter topology can promote the voltage gain of a conventional boost converter with a single inductor, and deal with the problem of the leakage inductor and demagnetization of transformer for a coupled-inductor-based converter. Some experimental results via examples of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) power source and a traditional battery are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power conversion strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.854023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/32268/01504873.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.854023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High step-up converter with coupled-inductor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"High step-up converter with coupled-inductor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504873/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8569620","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504873/","volume":"20","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High step-up converter with coupled-inductor","sourcePdf":"01504873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059122S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"32268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"441","xplore-issue":"32268","articleId":"1504873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1504874,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

The optimum AVC control is compared with previous fixed or narrow frequency range control strategies to show that it improves performance over all the output power range for different loads.

The control law is designed in Simulink/Matlab and applied to the converter via a 1920-Hz pulse width modulator both executed in real time using the DS1104 DSP of dSPACE. A 1.25 kW laboratory prototype is developed for validation. The experimental results are given for different operating conditions: nominal power operation, balanced and unbalanced dc load steps, boost inductor variation, and reactive power control. The proposed control law performs perfectly in a wide operation range giving low output voltage ripple, low line-current THD, a small overshoot and a fast settling time under system parameters variation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2005.854034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/32268/01504879.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2005.854034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"A DSP-based implementation of a nonlinear model reference adaptive control for a three-phase three-level NPC boost rectifier prototype","volume":"20","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504879/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8569626","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504879/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSP-based implementation of a nonlinear model reference adaptive control for a three-phase three-level NPC boost rectifier prototype","sourcePdf":"01504879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084186S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"32268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"32268","articleId":"1504879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1504880,"authors":[{"name":"B.

From a semi-tutorial perspective, a number of previous results are rederived and new insights are gained within a unified framework. A probabilistic derivation of the well-known Viterbi algorithm, forward-backward, and sum-product algorithms, shows that a basic metric emerges naturally under very general causality and finite-memory conditions. This result implies that detection solutions based on one algorithm can be systematically extended to other algorithms. For stochastic channels described by a suitable parametric model, a conditional Markov property is shown to imply this finite-memory condition. This conditional Markov property, although seldom met exactly in practice, is shown to represent a reasonable and useful approximation in all considered cases. We consider, as examples, linear predictive and noncoherent detection schemes. While good performance for increasing complexity can often be achieved with a finite-memory detection strategy, key issues in the design of detection algorithms are the computational efficiency and the performance for limited complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504903/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567150","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A unified framework for finite-memory detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified framework for finite-memory detection","sourcePdf":"01504903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08254S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1504905,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper, we tackle this problem and present a receiver design consisting of a single filter and a subsequent noncoherent sequence detector. This receiver outperforms the conventional discriminator detector by more than 4 dB for typical Bluetooth channels. Thereby, the proposed noncoherent sequence detection (NSD) algorithm is both favorably low complex as it operates on a two-state trellis and highly robust against channel phase variations caused by low-cost local oscillators. The particular filter design accomplishes effective out-of-band interference suppression. Different from previous work on sequence detector receivers published in the literature, we take possible variations of the Bluetooth modulation parameters into account, and we also devise efficient methods for combined NSD and forward error correction decoding. Hence, the presented receiver design is an attractive solution for practical Bluetooth devices.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bluetooth","Detectors","Filters","Forward error correction","Frequency","Phase detection","Robustness","Local oscillators","Interference suppression","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","trellis coded modulation","Gaussian channels","oscillators","interference suppression","forward error correction","error correction codes","adaptive decoding","continuous phase modulation","frequency shift keying","filtering theory","receivers","adaptive signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth system","noncoherent sequence detection algorithm","NSD","two-state trellis","channel phase variation","local oscillators","filter design","out-of-band interference suppression","modulation parameter","forward error correction decoding","adaptive receivers","continuous phase modulation","CPM","Gaussian frequency-shift keying","GFSK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive receivers","Bluetooth systems","continuous phase modulation (CPM)","Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK)","noncoherent sequence detection (NSD)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853791","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504905.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent sequence detection receiver for Bluetooth systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent sequence detection receiver for Bluetooth systems","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8567152","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","volume":"23","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504905/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent sequence detection receiver for Bluetooth systems","sourcePdf":"01504905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071626S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1504906,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The suboptimal differential detection in this work refers to the bit metric calculation based only on the difference between two consecutive symbols, in contrast to more complex maximum-likelihood (ML)-based differential detection, which makes use of all the observed consecutive symbols for its metric calculation in channel decoding. As benchmarks of coded system performance, we analyze the average mutual information (AMI) and cutoff rate of this system. Exact probability density functions of the suboptimal differential detector outputs are derived for this purpose. Comparative studies suggest that the performance loss of the suboptimal approach is in fact noticeable.

The proposed algorithms are obtained as an application of the sum-product algorithm to the factor graph representing the joint a posteriori probability mass function of the information bits given the channel output. In order to overcome the problems due to the presence in the factor graph of continuous random variables, we apply the method of canonical distributions . Several choices of canonical distributions have been considered in the literature. Well-known approaches consist of discretizing continuous variables or treating them as jointly Gaussian, thus obtaining a Kalman estimator. Our first new approach, based on the Fourier series expansion of the phase probability density function, yields better complexity/performance tradeoff with respect to the usual discretized-phase method. Our second new approach, based on the Tikhonov canonical distribution, yields near-optimal performance at very low complexity and is shown to be much more robust than the Kalman method to the placement of pilot symbols in the coded frame. We present numerical results for binary LDPC codes and LDPC-coded modulation, with particular reference to some phase-noise models and coded-modulation formats standardized in the next-generation satellite Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-S2). These results show that our algorithms achieve near-coherent performance at very low complexity without requiring any change to the existing DVB-S2 standard.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504908.pdf","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for iterative decoding in the presence of strong phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for iterative decoding in the presence of strong phase noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504908/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8567155","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504908/","volume":"23","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for iterative decoding in the presence of strong phase noise","sourcePdf":"01504908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128502S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1504909,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With a pragmatic approach, we show how to design LDPC codes tailored for simple and robust modulation formats, such as differentially encoded (DE) modulations. The LDPC codes are optimized through the use of a recently proposed analysis technique based on extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. In particular, we optimize, through a \"clever\" random walk in the parametric space, the degree distributions of the outer LDPC codes, obtaining significant insights on the impact of such distributions on the performance of the proposed concatenated schemes. The optimization is carried out for transmission over both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and a noncoherent channel. The performance predicted by the EXIT chart-based optimization is confirmed by results obtained via computer simulations, considering phase-shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation at the transmitter side, and iterative demodulation/decoding at the receiver side. The significance of the proposed optimized design of LDPC-coded schemes with DE modulations is validated by the fact that standard nonoptimized LDPC codes perform poorly when used together with inner DE modulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504909.pdf","startPage":"1758","endPage":"1768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Serial concatenation of LDPC codes and differential modulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Serial concatenation of LDPC codes and differential modulations","volume":"23","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504909/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567156","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504909/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Serial concatenation of LDPC codes and differential modulations","sourcePdf":"01504909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193368S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1504910,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We explore two possible solutions for this channel with increasing degree of sophistication. The first one utilizes pilots at the transmitter and a simple and explicit noniterative channel estimation algorithm at the receiver. We show that this pilot-assisted system is exactly equivalent, in terms of performance analysis and design, to an appropriately \"degraded\" system having perfect CSI at the receiver. The second scheme utilizes pilots and a family of well-justified and simple suboptimal iterative detection/estimation algorithms. It is shown that when turbo-like codes are considered in conjunction with this pilot-assisted transmission scheme and the proposed receiver algorithm, the unitary constellations investigated in the literature are inferior to simple pilot-assisted constellations in both complexity and performance. Specific instances of the proposed systems (that use optimized irregular low-density parity-check outer codes) are designed. The design examples provided show that the proposed systems can achieve a good tradeoff between complexity and performance and can be used to bridge the gap between the high complexity/high-performance optimal scheme and low-complexity/mediocre performance noniterative estimation/coherent detection scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504910.pdf","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1778","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code and receiver design for the noncoherent fast-fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Code and receiver design for the noncoherent fast-fading channel","volume":"23","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504910/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567157","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code and receiver design for the noncoherent fast-fading channel","sourcePdf":"01504910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066632S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1504911,"authors":[{"name":"Jibing Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/32269/1504911/1504911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jibing Wang (S'98-M'03) received the Ph.

The original CD codes are designed based on the criterion of maximizing the expected distance between codeword pairs. However, in practical systems, it is more sensible to design the codes according to the minimum error rate criterion. The main difficulty in such a design is that the error probability does not admit a closed-form expression and, thus, conventional optimization methods cannot be applied. In this paper, we formulate the minimum error-rate CD code design as an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem, and employ the stochastic approximation technique with gradient estimation to solve it. Simulation results show that codes generated by the proposed design procedure generally outperform the CD codes designed by maximizing the expected distance between codeword pairs and the Cayley threaded algebraic space-time codes that satisfy the full rank criterion. The new CD codes also enjoy better or comparable performance over other group based or nongroup designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504911.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of minimum error-rate Cayley differential unitary space-time codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Stochastic processes","Decoding","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Modulation coding","Error analysis","Error probability","Closed-form solution","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","error statistics","stochastic processes","optimisation","gradient methods","algebraic codes","MIMO systems","channel coding","antenna arrays","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cayley differential code","unitary space-time modulation","noncoherent communication","multiple-antenna system","maximization","codeword pair","minimum error rate criterion","error probability","stochastic optimization problem","gradient estimation","codes generation","algebraic code","multiple-input-multiple-output","MIMO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cayley differential (CD) unitary space\u2013time coding","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","optimization","score function","stochastic approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of minimum error-rate Cayley differential unitary space-time codes","volume":"23","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504911/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567158","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of minimum error-rate Cayley differential unitary space-time codes","sourcePdf":"01504911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081649S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1504912,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/32269/1504912/1504912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, both in electrical engineering.

Acquiring knowledge of the fading coefficients in a MIMO channel is already very challenging in the frequency-flat (fast) fading case. In the frequency-selective case, this task becomes significantly more difficult due to the presence of multiple paths, which results in an increased number of parameters to be estimated. In this paper, we address code design for noncoherent frequency-selective MIMO-OFDM fading links, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel. We derive the code design criteria, quantify the maximum achievable diversity gain, and provide explicit constructions of full-diversity (space and frequency) achieving codes along with an analytical and numerical performance assessment. We also demonstrate that unlike in the coherent case, noncoherent space-frequency codes designed to achieve full spatial diversity in the frequency-flat fading case can fail completely to exploit not only frequency diversity but also spatial diversity when used in frequency-selective fading environments.

The proposed detector, termed an eigen-assisted (EA) receiver, constructs a sample-correlation matrix from the L length-N received signals, determines its two principal eigenvectors, and uses these eigenvectors to reconstruct the two transmitted length-N patterns. Scalar differential encoding is performed at the transmit antennas, and as a result, the transmitted data can be recovered from the reconstructed patterns using scalar multiple-symbol differential detection. In other words, ST-differential encoding is not required at the transmitter and the constellation expansion typically observed with nonbinary signaling is avoided; a highly desirable result under a peak power constraint. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed EA-receiver is only 0.25 dB away from the coherent detection (with differential encoding) lower bound for the modulations considered. For quadrature phase-shift keying at a bit-error rate of 10/sup -4/, our EA-receiver with N=64 outperforms a decision feedback detector by 1 dB (L=1) and conventional ST-differential detection by more than 2.5 dB (L=2). Note that the complexity of our receiver, per symbol decision, is essentially independent of N and is comparable to that of a conventional ST-differential detector. The conclusion is reached that the proposed encoder/receiver pair is a promising alternative to currently known noncoherent techniques employing Alamouti-type ST-modulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853811","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1820","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504914.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An eigen-assisted noncoherent receiver for Alamouti-type space-time modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An eigen-assisted noncoherent receiver for Alamouti-type space-time modulation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","volume":"23","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504914/","accessionNumber":"8567161","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504914/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An eigen-assisted noncoherent receiver for Alamouti-type space-time modulation","sourcePdf":"01504914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08292S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1504915,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Ling","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Newcastle, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/32269/1504915/1504915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Ling (A'01-S'02-M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Nanjing Institute of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2005.","He is currently a Postdoc at the University of Newcastle, Australia.

Their approximate decoding algorithm, however, has not unleashed the full potential of lattice decoding. In this paper, we present several improved algorithms, generally referred to as differential lattice decoding (DLD), for multiantenna communication. We first analyze two distinct approximate DLD algorithms, and then develop an algorithm that exactly finds the closest lattice point in the Euclidean space. This exact DLD is subsequently augmented by local search to compensate for the remaining approximation. The small amount of extra complexity of the exact or augmented DLD is rewarded by a clear performance gain. We find that employing basis reduction is very effective to reduce the overall decoding complexity for high lattice dimensions. Moreover, the dimension of the lattice defined in this paper is independent of the number of receive antennas, which results in not only lower complexity, but also better performance for a multiantenna receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853795","startPage":"1821","endPage":"1829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504915.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-antenna differential lattice decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504915/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple-antenna differential lattice decoding","volume":"23","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504915/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8567162","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-antenna differential lattice decoding","sourcePdf":"01504915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058155S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1504919,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.S.

Due to its simplicity, there is renewed interest in TR signaling for ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) systems. To assess the performance of these systems, we develop an analytical framework based on the sampling expansion approach. In particular, we derive closed-form expression for the bit-error probability (BEP) of TR signaling with AcR that can be used to exploit multipath diversity inherent in wideband channels. We further extend our analysis to the BEP derivation of modified AcR with noise averaging. Our methodology does not require the Gaussian approximation and is applicable for any fading scenario, provided that the correlator output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be characterized in terms of a characteristic function. We show that the validity of the conventional Gaussian approximation depends on the time-bandwidth product and the number of transmitted pulses per symbol. Our results enable the derivation of a computationally simple lower bound on the BEP of TR signaling with AcR. This lower bound allows us to obtain the SNR penalty associated with an AcR, as compared with All-Rake and Partial-Rake receivers.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504919.pdf","startPage":"1863","endPage":"1874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of UWB transmitted-reference communication systems in dense multipath channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504919/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of UWB transmitted-reference communication systems in dense multipath channels","volume":"23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567166","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1504919/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of UWB transmitted-reference communication systems in dense multipath channels","sourcePdf":"01504919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086425S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504921,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The error, which is a quadratic function of the equalizer vector, is used to design an adaptive algorithm of stochastic gradient type. The approach differs from those proposed previously, which linearize the post-detection error to enable the use of least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive equalizers. The proposed quadratic-error (Q) algorithm has complexity comparable to that of LMS, and equal convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate performance improvement over methods based on linearized-error (L) algorithm.

The performance of fixed decode-and-forward and selection relaying protocols is evaluated in both symmetric and asymmetric interuser-channel cases. The lower bound on the performance of the decode-and-forward protocol is given, while the exact bit-error probability of the selection relaying protocol is thoroughly derived. The decode-and-forward relaying protocol achieves a performance gain when the signal-to-noise ratios in the interuser channels are symmetric and sufficiently high. The selection relaying protocol shows a larger performance gain and does not exhibit an error floor like in the case of the decode-and-forward protocol. In addition, it is robust to the asymmetric interuser channels.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2005.853792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/32269/01504922.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2005.853792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32269","startPage":"1891","endPage":"1900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential modulation for two-user cooperative diversity systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential modulation for two-user cooperative diversity systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504922/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8567169","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504922/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential modulation for two-user cooperative diversity systems","sourcePdf":"01504922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091822S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"32269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"32269","articleId":"1504922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1504923,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

In traditional analyses of MIMO systems, such superdirectivity is not observed due to the commonly applied constraint that limits the excitation current magnitudes. However, when an electromagnetically appropriate constraint on the power radiated by the array is applied, the computed capacity can include effects of transmit superdirectivity. A similar result occurs at the receiver for spatially colored noise. This paper formulates the MIMO system capacity under these circumstances and provides a framework for computing this capacity when the level of tolerable superdirectivity (as measured by the superdirectivity Q factor) is constrained. Example computations using the framework illustrate the impact that superdirectivity can have on achievable MIMO system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.854530","startPage":"2850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/32270/01504941.pdf","endPage":"2857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.854530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504941/","displayDocTitle":"Superdirectivity in MIMO systems","volume":"53","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504941/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8568638","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superdirectivity in MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"01504941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089576S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"32270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"32270","articleId":"1504941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504942,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

In simulations involving structured finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grids, this strategy is often referred as subgridding (SG). Although SG can lead to major computational savings, it is known to cause instabilities, spurious reflections, and other accuracy problems. In this paper, we introduce two strategies to combat these problems. First, we present an overlapped SG (OSG) approach combined with digital filters (in space). OSG can recover standard SG (SSG) schemes but it is based upon a more general, explicit separation between interpolation/decimation operations and the FDTD field update itself. This allows for a better classification of errors associated with the subgrid interface. More importantly, digital filters and phase matching techniques can be then employed to combat those errors. Second, we introduce SG with a domain overriding (SG-DO) strategy, consisting of overlapped (sub)grid regions that contain auxiliary (buffer) subdomains with perfectly matched layers (PML) to allow explicit control on the reflection and transmission properties at SG interfaces. We provide two-dimensional (2-D) numerical examples showing that residual errors from 2-D SG-DO FDTD simulations can be significantly reduced when compared to SSG schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/32270/01504951.pdf","startPage":"2938","endPage":"2951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.854558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.854558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved FDTD subgridding algorithms via digital filtering and domain overriding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Filtering algorithms","Digital filters","Reflection","Two dimensional displays","Numerical simulation","Maxwell equations","Grid computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Maxwell equations","finite difference time-domain analysis","digital filters","interpolation","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Maxwell equations","disparate geometric scales","finite-difference time-domain grids","FDTD","reflection","overlapped subgridding","OSG approach","digital filters","standard subgridding scheme","SSG","interpolation operation","phase matching techniques","domain overriding strategy","perfectly matched layers","PML","transmission property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital filtering","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","subgridding (SG)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Improved FDTD subgridding algorithms via digital filtering and domain overriding","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504951/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568648","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved FDTD subgridding algorithms via digital filtering and domain overriding","sourcePdf":"01504951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128734S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"32270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"32270","articleId":"1504951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504952,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.

The basic idea is to define suitable algebraic expressions that reflect numerical inaccuracies reliably.

In order to apply this procedure, an error expansion in terms of cylindrical harmonic functions is performed, which also enables accuracy enhancement for all propagation angles. The design process produces a set of two-dimensional (2-D) FDTD algorithms with optimized frequency response. Contrary to conventional methodologies, the proposed techniques adjust their reliability range according to the requirements of the examined problem and can be, therefore, more efficient in computationally demanding simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/32270/01504952.pdf","startPage":"2952","endPage":"2960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.854559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.854559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of higher order FDTD schemes with controllable dispersion error","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Error correction","Frequency estimation","Process design","Algorithm design and analysis","Two dimensional displays","Design optimization","Frequency response","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","higher order statistics","finite difference time-domain analysis","minimisation","circular waveguides","electromagnetic wave propagation","frequency response","reliability theory","computational electromagnetics","error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inherent dispersion error control","higher order finite-difference time-domain scheme","two-dimensional FDTD algorithm","algebraic expressions","minimization","error estimator","cylindrical harmonic functions","propagation angles","optimization","frequency response","reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","higher order methods","numerical dispersion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Development of higher order FDTD schemes with controllable dispersion error","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504952/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568649","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of higher order FDTD schemes with controllable dispersion error","sourcePdf":"01504952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125515S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"32270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32270","articleId":"1504952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1504962,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/32270/1504962/1504962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiqin Zhao received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, in 1990, 1993, and 2002, respectively.","From 1996 to 1999, he was with the Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

If the structure is large relative to wavelengths of interest, the large number of required frequency-domain computations may require significant computational resources. An active learning framework is introduced to reduce the number of frequencies needed for frequency-domain numerical computations or measurements. This method is used to optimally select frequency points at which a computation of measurement should be performed, resulting in nonuniform frequency sampling and often a reduced number of total frequency points (vis-a/spl grave/-vis uniform sampling). In this paper we focus on wide-band frequency-domain numerical modeling, demonstrating a reduction in the required number of computations. The method consists of two basic steps, tied to fitting the frequency-domain data to a simple parametric model. One step involves estimation of model parameters using a least-square (LS) algorithm. This process is based on data from frequency points computed thus far by the rigorous numerical model. The next step is to optimally choose the next frequency point for analysis by the numerical model. This new frequency point is selected with the goal of reducing uncertainty in the simplified parametric model (quantified via the Fisher information matrix). Iterating these two steps, a sequence of numerical computations are performed, each at the most informative frequency for learning the parameters of the associated simpler parametric model. After demonstrating this technique with scattering problems, the idea is employed for design of an ultrawide-band antenna. In this design, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the geometry and the resistive loading of an antenna, with the number of required frequency-domain numerical computations reduced by the parametric model and active learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504962/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568659","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform frequency sampling with active learning: application to wide-band frequency-domain modeling and design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform frequency sampling with active learning: application to wide-band frequency-domain modeling and design","sourcePdf":"01504962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06186S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"32270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"32270","articleId":"1504962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1504963,"authors":[{"name":"Dehong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/32270/1504963/1504963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dehong Liu was born in Hubei, China, in 1975.

We first investigate the theory of electromagnetic time-reversal imaging, followed by an experimental demonstration. A transmitter-receiver antenna array is connected to a network analyzer and applied to transmit wideband waveforms for detecting a target within a cluttered environment. We assume the cluttered background is fixed, thus the target signature is extracted by observing changes manifested by the introduction of a target. A numerical algorithm is required for computation of the Green's function employed within the time-reversal imager, with this implemented here via ray tracing. Example time-reversal images of different cluttered backgrounds and different targets are presented using measured data, with comparisons to a traditional radar imaging technique. Results show that the time-reversal imagery yields good focusing at the target, significantly better than when the background is not accounted for.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.854563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32270","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3066","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/32270/01504963.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic time-reversal imaging of a target in a cluttered environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1504963/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic time-reversal imaging of a target in a cluttered environment","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568660","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic time-reversal imaging of a target in a cluttered environment","sourcePdf":"01504963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07035S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"32270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"32270","articleId":"1504963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-09"},{"_id":1504985,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With the dual-plane configuration, the proposed structure displays an ultrawide stopband with high attenuation within a small circuit area. Chebyshev distribution is adopted to eliminate ripples in the passband caused by the periodicity of the EBG structure. This gives rise to a compact EBG structure that exhibits excellent transmission and rejection characteristics in the passband and the stopband, respectively. The proposed structures are implemented and the measurement results are found to be in good agreement with the simulation results, verifying the excellent stopband and passband performance obtained using the proposed configuration. These novel structures are easy to fabricate and are promising structures that have wide applications for compact and high performance circuit component designs in microwave circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/32271/01504986.pdf","startPage":"2656","endPage":"2664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.854212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.854212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1504986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tapered dual-plane compact electromagnetic bandgap microstrip filter structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","Microstrip filters","Passband","Band pass filters","Metamaterials","Microwave circuits","Displays","Attenuation","Chebyshev approximation","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip filters","band-pass filters","band-stop filters","photonic band gap","periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact electromagnetic bandgap filter","microstrip filter","dual-plane configuration","ultrawide stopband","Chebyshev distribution","ripples elimination","EBG structure","transmission characteristic","rejection characteristic","stopband performance","passband performance","circuit component designs","microwave circuits","bandstop filters","low sidelobe array theory","tapering functions","tapering techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandstop filters","dual-plane","electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures","low sidelobe array theory","microstrip filters","tapering functions","tapering techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1504986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Tapered dual-plane compact electromagnetic bandgap microstrip filter structures","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1504986/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568695","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tapered dual-plane compact electromagnetic bandgap microstrip filter structures","sourcePdf":"01504986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066801S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"32271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"32271","articleId":"1504986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1504988,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems Laboratory Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/32271/1504988/1504988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming-Dou Ker (S'92\u2013M'94\u2013SM'97) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986, 1988, and 1993, respectively.","In 1994, he joined the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Design Department, Computer and Communication Research Laboratories (CCL), Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan, R.O.C., as a Circuit Design Engineer.

Then, the solution of the volume integral-equation concerning with the NRD-guide circuits has been reduced to a two-dimensional planar problem in connection with each vertical mode. In this way, only the diagonal submatrices need to be calculated due to the orthogonal property of different vertical modes.

It is a systematic computational method to address the situation where an existing device model cannot fit new device data well. By modifying the current and voltage relationships in the model, Neuro-SM produces a new model exceeding the accuracy limit of the existing model. In this paper, a novel analytical formulation of Neuro-SM is proposed to achieve the same accuracy as the basic formulation of Neuro-SM (known as circuit-based Neuro-SM) with much higher computational efficiency. Through our derivations, the mapping between the existing (coarse) model and the overall Neuro-SM model is analytically achieved for dc, small-signal, and large-signal simulation and sensitivity analysis. The proposed analytical formulation is a significant advance over the circuit-based Neuro-SM, due to the elimination of extra circuit equations needed in the circuit-based formulation. A two-phase training algorithm utilizing gradient optimization is also developed for fast training of the analytical Neuro-SM models. Application examples on modeling heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT), metal-semiconductor-field-effect transistor (MESFET), and high-electron mobility transmistor (HEMT) devices and the use of Neuro-SM models in harmonic balance simulations demonstrate that the analytical Neuro-SM is an efficient approach for modeling various types of microwave devices.

The direct conversion is accomplished using six-port technology. In order to demodulate various phase-shift-keying/quadrature-amplitude-modulation (PSK/QAM) modulated signals at a high bit rate, a new analog baseband circuit was specially designed according to the I/Q equations presented in the theoretical part. An experimental prototype has been fabricated and measured. Simulation and measurement results for binary PSK, quaternary PSK (QPSK), 8 PSK, 16 PSK, and 16 QAM modulated signals at a bit rate up to 40 Mb/s are presented to validate the proposed approach. A software-defined radio can be designed using the new front-end and only two analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) because the I/Q output signals are generated by analog means. Previous six-port receivers make use of four ADCs to read the six-port dc levels and require digital computations to generate the I/Q output signals. With the proposed approach, the load of the signal processor will therefore be reduced and the modulation speed can be significantly increased using the same digital signal processor.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.854181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32271","startPage":"2768","endPage":"2776","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/32271/01505000.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.854181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ka-band analog front-end for software-defined direct conversion receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Receivers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit rate","Signal design","Quadrature phase shift keying","Signal generators","Application software","Phase modulation","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software radio","phase shift keying","microwave receivers","quadrature amplitude modulation","microwave circuits","analogue processing circuits","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ka-band analog front-end","software-defined direct conversion receiver","software-defined radio","six-port technology","PSK/QAM modulated signals","analog baseband circuit","I/Q equations","analog-to-digital converters","digital signal processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct conversion","front-end","phase-shift keying (PSK)","quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)","six-port"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Ka-band analog front-end for software-defined direct conversion receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1505000/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8577104","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ka-band analog front-end for software-defined direct conversion receiver","sourcePdf":"01505000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064238S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"32271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"32271","articleId":"1505000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1505006,"authors":[{"name":"Se-Ho You","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/32271/1505006/1505006-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Se-Ho You (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea, and the M.S degree from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.

These field and circuit analysis components are consistently interfaced and the resulting coupled set of nonlinear equations is evolved in time by a multidimensional Newton-Raphson scheme. The solution procedure is accelerated by allocating field- and circuit-related computations across the processors of a distributed-memory cluster, which communicate using the message-passing interface standard. Furthermore, the electromagnetic field solver, whose demand for computational resources far outpaces that of the circuit solver, is accelerated by a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based algorithm, viz. the time-domain adaptive integral method. The resulting parallel FFT accelerated transient field-circuit simulator is applied to the analysis of various active and nonlinear microwave circuits, including power-combining arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.854260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/32271/01505009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.854260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32271","startPage":"2851","endPage":"2865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel FFT accelerated transient field-circuit simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A parallel FFT accelerated transient field-circuit simulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8577113","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1505009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel FFT accelerated transient field-circuit simulator","sourcePdf":"01505009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120951S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"32271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"32271","articleId":"1505009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1505011,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The boundary condition is formulated for the general three-dimensional analysis of waveguides with an arbitrary cross section. All waveguide modes, including transverse electromagnetic, transverse electric, and transverse magnetic modes, are accounted for in the boundary condition in a unified formulation. Both propagating and evanescent modes can be properly absorbed. The proposed formulation is validated by numerical examples, and the accuracy and stability of the algorithm are investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/32271/01505027.pdf","startPage":"3014","endPage":"3023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.854223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.854223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate waveguide port boundary condition for the time-domain finite-element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Time domain analysis","Finite element methods","Electromagnetic waveguides","Finite difference methods","Magnetic analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic propagation in absorbing media","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","finite element analysis","boundary-elements methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide port boundary condition","time domain finite element method","mesh truncation","finite difference time domain method","waveguide 3D analysis","transverse electromagnetic modes","transverse electric modes","transverse magnetic modes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-element method (FEM)","numerical analysis","time-domain analysis","waveguide devices","waveguide port boundary condition (WPBC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"An accurate waveguide port boundary condition for the time-domain finite-element method","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1505027/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8577131","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate waveguide port boundary condition for the time-domain finite-element method","sourcePdf":"01505027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054211S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"32271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"32271","articleId":"1505027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1505030,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

Single event upsets (SEU), (also known as soft-errors) account for a considerable amount of radiation induced errors. SEU are difficult to detect & correct when they affect memory-elements present in the FPGA, which are used for the implementation of finite state machines (FSM). Conventional practice to improve FPGA design reliability in the presence of soft-errors is through configuration memory scrubbing, and through component redundancy. Configuration memory scrubbing, although suitable for combinatorial logic in an FPGA design, does not work for sequential blocks such as FSM. This is because the state-bits stored in flip-flops (FF) are variable, and change their value after each state transition. Component redundancy, which is also used to mitigate soft-errors, comes at the expense of significant area overhead, and increased power consumption compared to nonredundant designs. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach to implement the FSM using synchronous embedded memory blocks to enhance the runtime reliability without significant increase in power consumption. Experiments conducted on various benchmark FSM show that this approach has higher reliability, lower area overhead, and consumes less power compared to a component redundancy technique.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/32272/01505051.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2005.853438","doi":"10.1109/TR.2005.853438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced reliability of finite-state machines in FPGA through efficient fault detection and correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced reliability of finite-state machines in FPGA through efficient fault detection and correction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505051/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505051/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8568684","volume":"54","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced reliability of finite-state machines in FPGA through efficient fault detection and correction","sourcePdf":"01505051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07019S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"32272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"32272","articleId":"1505051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1505072,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The motion can either be intentional, as in an active stereo head, or due to vibrations, heat etc. which is commonly found in automotive applications. However, most approaches for finding the essential matrix relating the two cameras are computationally very expensive and, hence, this problem must be addressed. In this paper, we suggest deferring a large portion of the image processing onto a field programmable gate array (FPGA) since most operations can be heavily parallelized. The specific algorithm chosen to find point correspondences between the left and the right images is SIFT, which has the advantage of producing a very small number of outliers. Having few outliers is important as computing the essential matrix from point correspondences is an inherently unstable problem, particularly in the case where the cameras are nearly parallel. We present a system, which computes the computationally intensive parts of SIFT (Gaussian pyramid, Sobel etc) using an FPGA. The host computer then uses the resulting point correspondences to estimate the essential matrix with the help of a reduced model of the camera setup. On-line stereo calibration at frame rate (60Hz) is then possible without excessively loading the host computer.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2005.1505077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

It is usually done using several kinds of sensors (proprioceptive, GPS, camera). All the data are uncertain and even momentarily unavailable (GPS in urban areas for example). A data fusion process is necessary for sensors data to compensate one each other. We propose here to combine GPS absolute localization with data computed by a vision system giving the position and orientation of the vehicle on the road. This last local information is transformed into a global reference using a map of the environment. The localization parameters are estimated using a particles filter making it possible to manage multimodal estimations (the vehicle can be on the left lane or on the right one for example). Many results have been obtained in real time and on real roads by implementing this solution in an experimental vehicle. The best standard deviation reached is 48 cm along the road axis and 8 cm along the axis normal to the road.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1505109/","conferenceDate":"6-8 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8642954","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle localization on a digital map using particles filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle localization on a digital map using particles filtering","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01505109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059531S","chronDate":"6-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10053","isNumber":"32246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10053","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"32246","articleId":"1505109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1505110,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In IVC systems that use a spread spectrum communication (SS) scheme, when communication traffic goes into crowded conditions due to an increase of density of vehicles and IVC traffics, communication resources beyond the capacity of the system are sometimes required and this leads to unstable communication. Under this situation, the incident information that must be transmitted immediately is afraid to be jammed by excessive IVC traffics and relay transmission of the incident information may be intercepted. In this paper, an IVC system based on slotted MCS/CDMA scheme is proposed in order to avoid such a situation. The proposed system prepares an exclusive time slot for incident information in order to prioritize incident information from the general IVC packets that are less important than the incident information packets. As the result, it is considered that the possibility of interception of relay transmission can be decreased. Since the proposed system prepares an exclusive slot of incident information, there is a disadvantage where IVC throughput is reduced by an addition of an exclusive slot. In this paper, the performance of the proposed system is examined by computer simulation and optimization of parameters is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2005.1505110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

Such a framework is of major interest for driver assistance in an intelligent automotive cockpit environment. The proposed approach consists of two components. First, signs are detected using a set of Haar wavelet features obtained from AdaBoost training. Compared to previously published approaches, our solution offers a generic, joint modeling of color and shape information without the need of tuning free parameters. Once detected, objects are efficiently tracked within a temporal information propagation framework. Second, classification is performed using Bayesian generative modeling. Making use of the tracking information, hypotheses are fused over multiple frames. Experiments show high detection and recognition accuracy and a frame rate of approximately 10 frames per second on a standard PC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A system for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition using color, shape, and motion information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

In this paper, a collision mitigation system is proposed and evaluated towards various typical road situations. The aim of the system is to decrease the kinetic energy of the collision through automatic emergency braking that occurs 1 second before the collision. This emergency braking is triggered by an alarm coming from a decision unit taking into consideration the results of a generic obstacles detection system -based on fusion between stereovision and laser scanner- and a warning area in front of the vehicle. The different sub-systems are presented. Various typical dangerous road situations are then introduced. The behavior of the collision mitigation system towards these situations is presented through real tests carried out in the context of the ARCOS French project. These experiments show the reliability, the genericity and the efficiency of the system. In particular, the false alarm rate is low, the detection rate is high and the system proves to be reactive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A collision mitigation system using laser scanner and stereovision fusion and its assessment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

To be an intelligent vehicle, lane boundary is necessary information, so the system and the algorithm should be as simple and fast as possible. In this paper, we propose a new method based on color information and this method is applicable in complex environment. In this system, we first choose a region of interest to find out a threshold using statistical method in a color image. The threshold then will be used to distinguish possible lane boundary from the road. We use color-based segmentation to find out the lane boundary and use a quadratic function to approach it. This system demands low computational power and memory requirements, and is robust in the presence of noise, shadows, pavement, and obstacles such like cars, motorcycles and pedestrians conditions. The result images can be used as pre-processed images for lane tracking, road following or obstacle detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

Experimental results show good retrieval and classification performance, with robustness to environmental conditions such as variable lighting and shadows.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2005.1505198","startPage":"771","endPage":"776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings.

Sophisticated facilities of creating, editing, and managing documents are strongly required.

In this paper, we present a business card creation support system as one practical application of the model. The system manages aesthetic rules in an XML database and determines the business card layout by using genetic algorithm.

Therefore, future research and design of mobile networks shall focus on multi-carrier hybrid modulation systems with adaptive technology and multiple smart antennas. This paper describes multiple access techniques suitable for mobile communication systems, stresses the importance of resource allocation techniques, briefly touches on present mobile network technology and finally gives an overview of multiple-access techniques for future mobile networks","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2005.193713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2005.193713","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","displayPublicationTitle":"47th International Symposium ELMAR, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10014/32158/01505714.pdf","publicationTitle":"47th International Symposium ELMAR, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple access techniques for future generation mobile networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multiple access techniques for future generation mobile networks","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505714/","accessionNumber":"8614170","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505714/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple access techniques for future generation mobile networks","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"01505714.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080578S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10014","isNumber":"32158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10014","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32158","articleId":"1505714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ELMAR, Zadar","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1505772,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This array-receiver employs a fuzzy-logic control mechanism to perform the substantially nonlinear mapping of a two-parameter input vector of the squared error and squared error variation, denoted by (e/sup 2/, /spl Delta/e/sup 2/), into a scalar forgetting factor /spl lambda/. For the real-time applicability, a computationally efficient version of the proposed receiver is derived based on the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm using the fuzzy-inference controlled step-size /spl mu/. The proposed receiver achieves an arithmetic complexity similar to the conventional LMS and exponentially windowed (EW) RLS versions of the MMSE DS-CDMA receiver plus the slightly fuzzy-incurred computational cost. Moreover, this receiver is capable of providing both fast convergence/tracking capability as well as small steady-state misadjustment as compared with the conventional LMS and EW-RLS MMSE DS-CDMA receivers. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the convergence and tracking behavior of the proposed receiver with the amount of the L-sample iteration, the array of the M-element receiving antenna, and the size of the P-variable fuzzy set. The performance advantage of the receiver over other DS-CDMA receivers is investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505864.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression using fuzzy-logic-based space-time filtering techniques in multipath DS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Multiaccess communication","Least squares approximation","Resonance light scattering","Error correction","Convergence","Robustness","Adaptive arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy reasoning","least mean squares methods","antenna arrays","receiving antennas","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","interference suppression","multipath channels","convergence of numerical methods","sampling methods","iterative methods","adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear minimum mean-squared error","MMSE array-receiver","fuzzy-inference-based recursive least-squares algorithm","exponentially windowed RLS","asynchronous DS-CDMA interference suppression","direct sequence code division multiple access","frequency selective multipath fading","fuzzy-logic control mechanism","nonlinear mapping","least-mean-square algorithm","LMS","convergence","tracking capability","L-sample iteration","M-element receiving antenna","P-variable fuzzy set","space-time filtering technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression using fuzzy-logic-based space-time filtering techniques in multipath DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505864/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670135","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interference suppression using fuzzy-logic-based space-time filtering techniques in multipath DS-CDMA","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054999S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1505866,"authors":[{"name":"X.

This problem causes the overall interference to be a limiting factor, especially when high symbol rate signaling is considered. In order to resolve this problem the literature has proposed many code management techniques, based essentially on code sharing mechanisms among the active users in the system.

In this paper, we consider the optimal power scheduling for the joint estimation of a Gaussian source by an inhomogeneous Gaussian sensor network. The goal is to minimize the total power consumption while satisfying a certain mean squared distortion constraint. We assume that sensors transmit their observations in an analog fashion: each sensor simply amplifies and forwards its noise-corrupted analog observation through an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel to the fusion center (FC), while the latter combines the received sensor messages to generate the final estimate. Such analog forwarding strategy can be shown to be optimal in the single sensor case by Shannon's separation principle. For the multiple sensor case, we derive the optimal power scheduling using convex optimization and show that it admits a simple distributed implementation. Simulations show that the proposed power scheduling improves the mean squared error (MSE) performance by a large margin when compared to that achieved by the uniform power scheduling.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505884","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505884.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-efficient analog forwarding transmission in an inhomogeneous Gaussian sensor network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Power-efficient analog forwarding transmission in an inhomogeneous Gaussian sensor network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1505884/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670155","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-efficient analog forwarding transmission in an inhomogeneous Gaussian sensor network","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056274S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1505885,"authors":[{"name":"J.-J.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, this frequency offset causes large errors in the signal values and therefore it is important to minimize this offset. In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based scheme for carrier frequency offset synchronization in OFDM systems. The scheme is based on maximum-likelihood estimation and it is applicable for acquisition purposes as only one OFDM training symbol block is required, the algorithm has no inherent limit for the carrier frequency offset being estimated, and it is independent of any carrier phase offset that may occur. Its performance is compared against a method in the literature that also can estimate the carrier frequency offset using the received samples of only one OFDM training symbol block.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505890.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"155","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interpolation-based frequency-synchronization scheme for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency synchronization","Phase estimation","Signal processing","Laboratories","Oscillators","Radio transmitters","Doppler shift"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","OFDM modulation","oscillators","maximum likelihood estimation","radio transmitters","Doppler shift","synchronisation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation-based scheme","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM system","oscillator mismatch","Doppler shift","carrier frequency offset synchronization","maximum-likelihood estimation","training symbol block","radio transmitter","radio receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"An interpolation-based frequency-synchronization scheme for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670161","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interpolation-based frequency-synchronization scheme for OFDM systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049269S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1505892,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In order to reach these high data rates, it is indispensable for the receiver to cancel multiple access interference (MAI) as to obtain a sufficiently high channel quality. In practice this renders the usage of conventional RAKE receivers impossible and makes equalization attractive to circumvent these problems. This paper describes and compares known equalization schemes (MMSE, selected adaptive techniques) as well as new proposals (MMSE-RAKE). Other than related publications, the performance evaluation is based on measurements over a physical channel at 2.45 GHz and is hence truly representative for a real HSDPA system. Further, the comparison is drawn both on performance and complexity, keeping a real-time implementation in focus.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and real-time measurement of HSDPA equalizers","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505893","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505893.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design and real-time measurement of HSDPA equalizers","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505893/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670164","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and real-time measurement of HSDPA equalizers","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0522S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1505895,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The proposed approach is to make each relay node to detect only a fraction (sub-stream) of the source data stream and forward all sub-streams simultaneously over the same physical channel. Then, multiple receive antennas at the destination allow the sub-streams to be detected separately based on their spatial characteristics. The distinctive benefit of this approach is the reduction of transmit and receive processing requirements on each relay node. Therefore, the proposed approach is particularly attractive in sending high-rate data where each relay node can handle only low-rates due to limited resources in terms of energy, computation power, hardware, and space (size).","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505896","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505896.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505896/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spatial multiplexing for high-rate wireless communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505896/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spatial multiplexing for high-rate wireless communications","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09122S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1505897,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This definition is motivated by an analysis of the pairwise error probability. The maximum-SNR (MSNR) class of prefilters includes decision feedback equalization (DFE) and channel shortening equalization (CSE) prefilters. The feedback taps are completely suppressed by the CSE prefilter and not suppressed at all by the DFE prefilter. The MSNR class includes hybrid prefilters which are a combination of CSE and DFE prefilters. Hybrid prefilters allow middle ground for suppressing feedback taps which is desirable for equalization using decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE). We show simulation results for joint DFSE demodulation of two 8-PSK modulated cochannel EDGE users using a single antenna receiver. We find that a hybrid prefilter performs best for this example.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505897","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","startPage":"186","endPage":"190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum SNR prefiltering for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum SNR prefiltering for MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670168","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1505897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum SNR prefiltering for MIMO systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07058S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1505898,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This topic is critical in many environments where new broadband systems are required to coexist with legacy narrowband systems. This paper is focused on minimisation of the performance degradation of the narrow-band system(s) caused by the CDMA one. Common background in most of this topic deals with notch-filtering of CDMA signals in transmitter to minimise its interference over the narrowband signal. However, this solution results in effective spreading codes longer that bit time, causing ISI within the CDMA system. The solution that is proposed in this contribution is the design of spreading codes that notch the CDMA power spectrum density (PSD) on specified bandwidth intervals where narrow-band signals are transmitted. To achieve this, spreading codes are selected from the orthogonal set of polynomials arising from digital prolate functions (DPF) which have property of energy concentration in specified intervals. Provided solution guarantees null interference in CDMA system with orthogonal codes, strictly located within the bit period.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505900","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505900.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum interference prolate based spreading codes design DS-CDMA overlaying narrow band systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505900/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum interference prolate based spreading codes design DS-CDMA overlaying narrow band systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505900/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum interference prolate based spreading codes design DS-CDMA overlaying narrow band systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036808S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1505902,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The update can utilize information fed back from the turbo decoder output, resulting in a turbo equalizer, or from a soft decision operation without involving the decoder, yielding an iterative equalizer.

We investigate the impact of non-omnidirectional propagation pattern of antennas along with the impact of non-uniform distribution of the scatterers in the propagation environment which introduces non-isotropic wave propagation, at both transmitter and receiver ends. The non-isotropic propagation is described by non-uniform probability density functions (pdf) for the direction-of-departure (DOD) and the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the outgoing/incoming propagating waves from/to stations. The propagation patterns of antenna elements (and the effect of mutual coupling between them) are also described by the Fourier series expansion of antenna propagation patterns. The expression of the cross-correlation function (CCF) turns out to be a linear expansion of a number of Bessel functions of the first kind. The coefficients of this expansion are given by linear convolution of the Fourier series coefficients (FSC) of the corresponding antenna patterns and the FSCs of the corresponding pdf of the non-isotropic propagation directions. The Fourier analysis on the CCF shows impacts of non-isotropic environment and non-omnidirectional antennas on the spectrum of the received channel process while the maximum Doppler frequency shift remains invariant with variations of beam-patterns and the pdf of propagating waves.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505910.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"255","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross-correlation model for non-isotropic scattering with non-omnidirectional antennas in MIMO propagation channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas and propagation","MIMO","Rayleigh scattering","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Fourier series","Power capacitors","Fading","Random media","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","directive antennas","MIMO systems","antenna radiation patterns","antenna theory","radiowave propagation","Rayleigh channels","random media","radio receivers","radio transmitters","probability","Fourier series","Fourier analysis","Bessel functions","spectral analysis","Doppler shift","direction-of-arrival estimation","multipath channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-correlation function","CCF","nonisotropic scattering","nonomnidirectional antenna","MIMO channel","multiple-input multiple-output","antenna propagation pattern","Rayleigh fading channel","two-dimensional multipath random media","receiver","transmitter","nonuniform distribution","outgoing wave propagation","incoming wave propagation","probability density function","PDF","direction-of-departure","DOD","direction-of-arrival","DOA","antenna element","linear expansion","Bessel function","linear convolution","Fourier series coefficient","FSC","Fourier analysis","channel spectrum","Doppler frequency shift","beam-pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A cross-correlation model for non-isotropic scattering with non-omnidirectional antennas in MIMO propagation channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505910/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670181","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross-correlation model for non-isotropic scattering with non-omnidirectional antennas in MIMO propagation channels","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069623S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1505912,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

These protocols are, however, complicated by the fact that they require strict transmitter synchronization in order for the carrier signals from each source to arrive in phase and constructively combine at the intended destination. This paper develops an explicit method for synchronizing the carriers of two sources in a cooperative communication system with one destination. Unlike the prior work in this area, the approach described in this paper allows for source and/or destination mobility. The performance of the proposed carrier synchronization system is investigated for several channel models and practical design considerations are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8670183","htmlLink":"/document/1505912/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A method for carrier frequency and phase synchronization of two autonomous cooperative transmitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for carrier frequency and phase synchronization of two autonomous cooperative transmitters","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058918S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":1505913,"authors":[{"name":"L.S.

In general it was observed that, the number of clusters to optimize the energy consumption is a non-increasing function of long haul distance. By virtue of this, we conclude that as the long haul distance increases the cooperation among the nodes increases. Also, for large long haul distances the optimal number of clusters is shown to converge to a constant. Next, we propose a provably convergent block coordinate descent algorithm to determine the optimal joint rate and number of clusters. Through our numerical results it was observed that a cluster optimized cooperative MIMO transmission scheme can be more energy efficient than a rate only optimized scheme. Also a joint rate and cluster optimized transmission scheme can yield large scale energy savings for short and medium range applications compared to the rate only or cluster only optimized transmission schemes.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505913","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505913.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint rate and cluster optimization in cooperative MIMO sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505913/","displayDocTitle":"Joint rate and cluster optimization in cooperative MIMO sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670184","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1505913/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint rate and cluster optimization in cooperative MIMO sensor networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059726S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1505915,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A signal with a large crest factor is not only vulnerable in the presence of nonlinear components such as power amplifiers, but also leads to low transmission power efficiency. In this paper, we propose two blind selected mapping techniques to reduce the crest factor of a forward link CDMA signal. Both techniques are built on the concept of selecting for transmission, the signal with the lowest crest factor from a set of equivalent representations. They are \"blind\" in the sense that no side information on the selection is transmitted. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed crest factor reduction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505919","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01505919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1505919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","startPage":"294","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortionless crest factor reduction for forward link CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1505919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distortionless crest factor reduction for forward link CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1505919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670190","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1505919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortionless crest factor reduction for forward link CDMA","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01505919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050596S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1505919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506036,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zhang","id":"37278432600"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang-Gen Xia","id":"37274950700"},{"name":"P.C.

A new blind approach, is proposed to jointly estimate the channel matrix and the CFO. Our technique is based on a relaxed version of maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that ignores the finite alphabet constraint. Using such an approach, we show that the joint channel and CFO estimation problem is equivalent to finding the parameter estimates that maximize the principal eigenvalue of a certain data dependent matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite relaxing the finite alphabet constraint, the performance of the proposed blind detection scheme can approach that of the coherent receiver, provided that there are sufficient data blocks available per channel realization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506048.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint blind channel and carrier frequency offset estimation in orthogonally space-time block coded MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","MIMO","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Parameter estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Transmitters","Frequency synchronization","Context","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO systems","space-time codes","block codes","matrix algebra","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","maximum likelihood estimation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel-carrier frequency offset estimation","CFO","multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO communication system","orthogonal space-time-block code","OSTBC","channel matrix","maximum likelihood estimator","parameter estimation","maximization","eigenvalue","data dependent matrix","blind detection scheme","coherent receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Joint blind channel and carrier frequency offset estimation in orthogonally space-time block coded MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506048/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670204","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint blind channel and carrier frequency offset estimation in orthogonally space-time block coded MIMO systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041756S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506058,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The training sequence is sent during time-slots different from those of the signal. An advantage of this transmission scheme is that the channel estimation and the signal detection are independent. However, the training sequence occupies transmission bandwidth which would otherwise be available for transmission of the signal. This paper shows that in certain linearly precoded communication systems, such an independence can still be achieved without the training sequence consuming transmission bandwidth. A method for constructing such affine precoders, along with optimal training sequence design, and power allocation between the training sequence and the precoded signal are considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506064.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal superimposed training on linear precoding: a new affine precoder design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","White noise","Colored noise","Signal design","Fading","Design engineering","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Signal detection","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","precoding","bandwidth allocation","channel allocation","channel estimation","signal detection","sequential codes","affine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal superimposed training sequence","linear precoding","affine precoder design","wireless communication system","bandwidth transmission scheme","channel estimation","signal detection","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal superimposed training on linear precoding: a new affine precoder design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670220","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal superimposed training on linear precoding: a new affine precoder design","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103436S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506065,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such systems result from the use of a multiple beamforming strategy that exploits the channel eigenmodes or, in other words, from the use of joint transmit-receive linear signal processing techniques in multiantenna systems. Since an analytical closed-form expression for the average BER of the multiple beamforming scheme is difficult to be found, we derive an approximation of the BER performance for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) assuming a Rayleigh flat fading channel. In the high SNR regime, the BER versus SNR curve can be characterized in terms of two key parameters: the array gain and the diversity gain. Thus, the proposed analysis offers a simple approach to determine the average performance of the multiple beamforming scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical BER performance in spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506067.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analytical BER performance in spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506067/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical BER performance in spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052959S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506069,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A signal exhibits cyclostationarity if its cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) is non-zero for a non-zero cyclic frequency. The CAF and cyclic frequencies differ from one signal to another depending on their characteristics such as carrier frequency and baud rate. Therefore, the property of cyclostationarity exhibited by modulated signals can be exploited for signal recognition, extraction, and synchronization. In this paper, we employ cyclostationarity for the recognition of CDMA signals that use orthogonal spreading codes. First, we derive an explicit formula for the CAF of such CDMA signals, and then demonstrate how the cyclostationarity in association with the chip rate decreases as the number of multiplexed codes increases. We also show that this cyclostationarity completely disappears if a scrambling code is used together with the spreading code. Furthermore, we consider two cases for enhancing the detection probability: i) the case of antenna diversity and ii) the case when multiple CDMA signals exist in different channels in the same frequency bands. Finally, computer simulations show that the detection probability of a CDMA signal can be improved in the above two cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506071.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of CDMA signals with orthogonal codes using cyclostationarity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency synchronization","Autocorrelation","Sampling methods","Computer simulation","OFDM modulation","Probability","Laboratories","Reconnaissance","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","signal detection","cyclic codes","synchronisation","diversity reception","correlation theory","probability","modulation coding","antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","CDMA signal recognition","orthogonal spreading code","cyclostationarity","cyclic autocorrelation function","CAF","nonzero cyclic frequency","synchronization","probability detection","antenna diversity","signal modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of CDMA signals with orthogonal codes using cyclostationarity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670227","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of CDMA signals with orthogonal codes using cyclostationarity","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046499S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506074,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

For the single-input single-output Rayleigh fading channel it is zero. In contrast it is greater than zero in channels with a certain kind of diversity, e.g., multiple antennas at one side of the link. The optimal transmission strategy in single-channel systems is channel inversion. If multiple parallel channels are available for transmission, the power allocation across channels influences the temporal power allocation. In this work, we study the delay-limited capacity of parallel fading channels. We implicitly characterize it using the temporal waterfilling-level and derive two lower bounds that are tight either for small or high SNR. Then, the results are applied to parallel weighted Gaussian fading channels and the impact of the weights is derived.

In our model the source broadcasts the message and only the relays that are able to produce an inference of acceptable quality retransmit the message by using orthogonal space-time codes. The novelty of our transmission protocol is that, unlike other works on cooperative space-time coding, the code assignment is performed in a completely distributed way by having each node pick one column of the space-time code matrix at random. The interesting result of our analysis is that this simple method achieves the maximum possible diversity order for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below a threshold SNR/sub t/, which increases with node density. Hence depending on the SNR range of a given system, one can achieve the maximum diversity order by increasing the number of relay nodes. In addition, for any SNR, the average error probability of the scheme decreases proportional to L/sup N/, where L is the number of columns in the space-time code matrix, and N is the number of active relay nodes.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506075","startPage":"500","endPage":"504","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506075.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized distributed space-time coding for cooperative communication in self organized networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Randomized distributed space-time coding for cooperative communication in self organized networks","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506075/","accessionNumber":"8670231","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506075/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized distributed space-time coding for cooperative communication in self organized networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06358S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1506078,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An innovative concept for performance improvement in IR system, based on signal processing and adaptive modulation, is proposed. This technique, known from DSL, and currently under discussion for RF wireless, seems also attractive for IR indoor systems, but needs to be examined under the specific conditions of the wireless optical channel (new problem statement). As first evaluation step, we perform capacity analysis to assess potential data rates in the multi-path IR channel present in most rooms. We derive the optimal power control for IR channels subject to an optical power constraint. Results show that, depending on the channel state, system capacity dramatically varies which can be efficiently exploited only by an adaptive system.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2005.1506125","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 7th International Conference Transparent Optical Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 7th International Conference Transparent Optical Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10062/32277/01506125.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"174 Vol. 2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2005.1506125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis in indoor wireless infrared communication using adaptive multiple subcarrier transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506125/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis in indoor wireless infrared communication using adaptive multiple subcarrier transmission","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670691","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506125/","conferenceDate":"7-7 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis in indoor wireless infrared communication using adaptive multiple subcarrier transmission","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01506125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041369S","chronDate":"3-7 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10062","isNumber":"32277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10062","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"32277","articleId":"1506125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1506136,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We derive the arrival rate stability region and the adaptive scheduling policy that stabilizes any arrival rate point inside the region without knowing explicitly the arrival statistics. Then, we apply these results to the case of \"opportunistic\" beam-forming and space-time coding. The ability of accurately predicting the channel SNR dominates the performance of opportunistic beamforming. Hence, we propose to exploit synchronous pseudo-random beamforming matrices known a priori by the receivers in order to improve the channel state information quality. Under this scheme, it appears that for given feedback delay the relative merit of opportunistic beamforming and space-time coding (transmit diversity) strongly depends on the channel Doppler bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506198.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506198","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","startPage":"540","endPage":"544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of multiple transmit antennas in a queued SDMA/TDMA downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Impact of multiple transmit antennas in a queued SDMA/TDMA downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506198/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506198/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670239","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of multiple transmit antennas in a queued SDMA/TDMA downlink","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046341S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506199,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, we propose a low complexity adaptive FDFR code for closed loop multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. We show that with only channel singular vector knowledge at the transmitter, the open loop FDFR code can be adapted to the channel while maintaining the special layer structure of the code at the receiver. That special layer structure enables us to decouple the joint detection into optimal, but separate, decoding of each of the different layers which reduces the complexity exponent. The proposed low complexity adaptive scheme maintains the full diversity order. To fully exploit channel knowledge and improve the performance, adaptive power loading is also incorporated with the information of the singular values of the channel. The optimal loading scheme is derived from the upper bound of the symbol vector error rate, and the loading coefficients can be seen as match filtering to the singular values of the channel. The proposed scheme can also be implemented by spatial multiplexing with adaptive linear precoding.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506199","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506199.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity full diversity full rate code for closed loop MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506199/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity full diversity full rate code for closed loop MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670240","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506199/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity full diversity full rate code for closed loop MIMO","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071751S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506200,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The channel bandwidth resource is assumed to be allocated equally for broadcast and relay transmissions. Separate power constraints are assumed at the source and the two users. The fading state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver of each link, and hence the source and the two users can allocate their power adaptively according to the instantaneous channel state information in a distributed manner. For a fixed allocation of time (for TD broadcast) and power, an achievable rate region based on the relays using the decode-forward scheme for this model is derived. The resource (time and power) allocation is then optimized to maximize each boundary point of this rate region.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506200.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed optimal resource allocation for fading relay broadcast channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Fading","Relays","Broadcasting","Bandwidth","Downlink","Transmitters","Channel state information","Decoding","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","channel allocation","fading channels","broadcast channels","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","fading channel","orthogonal relay broadcast channel model","time-division scheme","power constraint","transmitter","receiver","channel state information","distributed manner","decode-forward scheme","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Distributed optimal resource allocation for fading relay broadcast channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506200/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670241","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed optimal resource allocation for fading relay broadcast channels","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04775S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1506201,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Stopping the BCG iterations before the algorithm converges, reduces the computational complexity as well as the performance loss due to channel estimation errors which is especially a problem in low sample support scenarios. We investigate the inherent robustness of the BCG method by deriving the corresponding filter factor matrix which is a well-known tool in the theory of ill-posed problems to describe and analyze regularizing effects. Moreover, we present a robust BCG algorithm where we applied the regularization method of diagonal loading in order to increase both robustness against estimation errors and flexibility in choosing the number of BCG iterations without decreasing performance. Finally, we use quasi-optimal loading instead of common heuristic choices. Simulation results of a frequency-selective multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system show the improved performance of the robust BCG filter compared to the conventional MWF despite of the enormously reduced computational complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Wiener filter","Signal processing algorithms","Equations","Estimation error","Computational complexity","Channel estimation","Autocorrelation","Circuit theory","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","matrix algebra","Wiener filters","channel estimation","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block conjugate gradient algorithm","BCG iteration","matrix Wiener filter","MWF","channel estimation error","regularization method","diagonal loading","flexibility","frequency-selective system","multiuser single-input multiple-output system","MU-SIMO"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506201","startPage":"555","endPage":"559","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506201.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and reduced-rank matrix Wiener filter based on the conjugate gradient algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust and reduced-rank matrix Wiener filter based on the conjugate gradient algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8670242","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506201/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust and reduced-rank matrix Wiener filter based on the conjugate gradient algorithm","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065686S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506202,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed K.

Based on a previous work on low-complexity nulling/canceling without prior information and with SNR ordering, we present a modified \"square-root\" algorithm for the proposed nulling canceling detection scheme, with cubic-order complexity. We compared the performance of an iterative detection and decoding scheme based on the proposed MIMO detector and that based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector. In a 4/spl times/4 system, our proposed detector had the same performance as the MAP detector for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation.

We find that cooperation with adaptive modulation provides large throughput improvement over multihop and direct transmissions.

However, these promising techniques have not been realized in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose transceiver architecture with MIMO-OFDM and medium access control (MAC) scheme for broadband ad hoc networks. In our scheme, each node has multiple antennas and the independent data flows from different nodes are made into virtual MIMO OFDM scheme. At each transmit node, space-time coding (STC) is used among multiple antennas to improve the reliability of the communication between nodes to nodes. Data flows from independent nodes can be separated using detection algorithms in receiver nodes. For this transceiver architecture, a new cross layer design MAC scheme-multiple antennas receiver initiated busy tone medium access (MARI-BTMA) is proposed based on receiver initiated busy tone medium access (RI-BTMA). MARI-BTMA uses multiple out of band busy-tones to notify the nodes about the number of users in the system to avoid the collision of the nodes on the same channel.

SML exploits the dissimilarities in spatial multipath propagation characteristics of distinct locations, as reflected in the received respective signal subspaces to localize a transmitter. The location detector utilizes a match of the received signal subspace with those in a database. The database can be constructed by measurement campaigns, or ray tracing based simulations. In this paper, we report the localization accuracy of SML using a database that is constructed using a measurement campaign and up to two base stations. Issues regarding the variations of signal subspace due to non-stationarities in the environment and tracking of mobile transmitters are also addressed briefly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506219.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"649","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical performance of subspace matching mobile localization using experimental data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Radio transmitters","Mobile communication","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation","Antenna arrays","Spatial databases","Base stations","FCC","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","radio transmitters","radio tracking","microcellular radio","statistical databases","ray tracing","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical performance","subspace matching localization","SML","microcellular environment","antenna array","spatial multipath propagation","location detector","mobile transmitter tracking","ray tracing simulation","database construction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Statistical performance of subspace matching mobile localization using experimental data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506219/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670260","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical performance of subspace matching mobile localization using experimental data","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05961S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506222,"authors":[{"name":"R. de Francisco","affiliation":["Institut Eur\u00e9com, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"R.","lastName":"de Francisco","id":"37294312700"},{"name":"D.T.M.

These schemes were designed for the case of absence of channel state information at the Transmitter (CSIT) (whereas at the receiver the coherent case of full CSIR is assumed). These spatiotemporal spreading schemes have been shown to allow to attain the optimal rate-diversity trade-off at high SNR. On the other hand, the capacity achieving solution for the case of full CSIT is based on spatial prefiltering with water filling on the streams. Extensions of this scheme have been proposed recently for the case of partial CSIT, but like the full CSIT schemes, they do not take advantage of maximal diversity. In this paper a combination of the solutions described above for no and full CSIT is proposed for the general case of partial CSIT, exploiting diversity sources in all cases of CSIT.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506222","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506222.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear precoding for MIMO transmission with partial CSIT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506222/","displayDocTitle":"Linear precoding for MIMO transmission with partial CSIT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506222/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear precoding for MIMO transmission with partial CSIT","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079529S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506224,"authors":[{"name":"T.Y.

However, for proper recovery of the input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for joint channel and data recovery. The algorithm makes use of the rich structure of the underlying communication problem-a structure induced by the data and channel constraints. These constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet constraints on the data, and sparsity, finite delay spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward (FB) Kalman filter. We also suggest a suboptimal modification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506224","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A forward-backward Kalman for the estimation of time-variant channels in OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A forward-backward Kalman for the estimation of time-variant channels in OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506224/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670265","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A forward-backward Kalman for the estimation of time-variant channels in OFDM","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065359S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1506225,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The channel expansion into this propagation signature subspace yields coefficients that are subject to fast fading. They are modeled as independent lowpass autoregressive processes.

The formulation developed in this paper holds for flat fading channels, and also for frequency selective channels; in this latter case, through a multicarrier perspective.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506228","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506228.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust power allocation techniques for MIMO systems under modulus channel knowledge at the transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506228/","displayDocTitle":"Robust power allocation techniques for MIMO systems under modulus channel knowledge at the transmitter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670269","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506228/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust power allocation techniques for MIMO systems under modulus channel knowledge at the transmitter","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05778S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506229,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The MLE is further simplified to be implementable with a delay locked loop (DLL) fine timing structure based on channel power delay profile (PDP).

Pricing is introduced to each user's performance objective to make that user notice the power it consumes. It then serves as a control signal to motivate users to efficiently share the limited transmission power at base station, even thought the adaptation of users signature sequences is independent. It is shown that the proposed adaptation scheme will converge to a set of signature sequences at which no user can further improve its own performance with unilateral adaptation. Simulation result indicates that a simple linear pricing function with a properly chosen unit price can significantly improve the system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed signature sequence adaptation via pricing for downlink of MC-CDMA system","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506238.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Distributed signature sequence adaptation via pricing for downlink of MC-CDMA system","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506238/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670279","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed signature sequence adaptation via pricing for downlink of MC-CDMA system","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074914S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506239,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In RTUM, we employ unitary matrices as constellation symbols, and utilize a recursive procedure to perform channel estimation and demodulation/decoding in an alternating manner. Central benefits of RTUM include: low-complexity implementation; transformation of the original fading channel without CSI into a series of parallel subchannels, each with perfect receive CSI but additional Gaussian noise; and convenience of analysis. By inspecting the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the RTUM, we are further able to identify three operating regimes that lead to distinct channel behaviors. For typical channels we establish a new rule of thumb that spectrally-efficient low-SNR \"coherent\" communication can be realized when the average channel SNR is larger than the mean square one-step prediction error of the block fading process.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506239","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506239.pdf","startPage":"746","endPage":"750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive training with unitary modulation for correlated block-fading MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506239/","displayDocTitle":"Recursive training with unitary modulation for correlated block-fading MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670280","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506239/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive training with unitary modulation for correlated block-fading MIMO channels","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054107S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506240,"authors":[{"name":"M.

On the other hand, it has recently been shown that, over a wide range of dimensions and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), the sphere decoder can be used to find the exact solution with an expected complexity that is roughly cubic in the dimension of the problem. However, the computational complexity of sphere decoding becomes prohibitive if the SNR is too low and/or if the dimension of the problem is too large. In recent work M. Stonjic et al. (2005), we have targeted these two regimes and attempted to find faster algorithms by employing a branch-and-bound technique based on convex relaxations of the original integer least-squares problem. In this paper, using ideas from H/sup /spl infin// estimation theory, we propose new lower bounds that are generally tighter than the ones obtained in M. Stonjic et al. (2005).

Sharif et al., (2005). In this paper, we study the generalization of this scheme to wideband broadcast channels. By using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, an L-tap wideband channel can be decomposed to N parallel narrowband channels, where N is larger than L. Neighboring subchannels are therefore highly correlated, and it is intuitive to say that each group of neighboring subchannels (forming a cluster) can be characterized by one channel quality. We show in this paper that users need only feedback the best signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio at the center of each cluster. Our results indicate that for cluster size of order N/L/spl radic/K, where K is the number of users, this feedback scheme maintains the same throughput scaling as when full CSI is known. Simulation results show that larger cluster sizes (N/2L) can also be implemented for a small throughput hit.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506244.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"775","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput analysis in wideband MIMO broadcast channels with partial feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Wideband","MIMO","Broadcasting","Feedback","Array signal processing","Channel state information","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","broadcast channels","channel coding","broadband antennas","transmitting antennas","antenna arrays","OFDM modulation","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput scaling","wideband MIMO","wideband broadcast channel","partial feedback","opportunistic transmit beamforming","partial channel state information","CSI","dirty paper coding","transmit antenna","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis in wideband MIMO broadcast channels with partial feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506244/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670285","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis in wideband MIMO broadcast channels with partial feedback","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086174S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506247,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The key idea consists of reformulating this problem as a support vector regression (SVR) problem in which the channel coefficients are the Lagrange multipliers of the dual problem. By employing the Vapnik's e-insensitivity loss function, the solution can be expanded in terms of a reduced number of Lagrange multipliers (i.e., the nonzero filter coefficients) and then a sparse solution is found. This method can be also used for non-sparse channels when the channel order has been highly overestimated. In this situation, the SRM principle pushes zero to the small leading and trailing terms of the impulse response.

Amplify forward and decoding forward are the widely used protocols for the cooperative diversity in the wireless communication networks. In both protocols, the information received by relay terminals are \"forwarded\" to destination or next relay terminals. Since signals sent at relay terminals and ones sent at the source terminal are correlated, there is information redundancy. To improve the energy efficiency of cooperative networks, we propose an encoding protocol, which is referred to as a nested cooperative encoding protocol. In our proposed protocol, the received signal at each relay terminal is divided into several sub-signals with the nest lattice structure of source information. Each of the sub-signals contains only a partial information with a smaller size of constellation compared to the original information sent by the source terminal. We show that our new protocols can achieve both high cooperative diversity and high energy efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested cooperative encoding protocol for wireless networks with high energy efficiency","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506254.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Nested cooperative encoding protocol for wireless networks with high energy efficiency","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506254/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670295","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested cooperative encoding protocol for wireless networks with high energy efficiency","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057851S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1506255,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The covariance matrix of the input that maximizes the throughput is obtained. Results show that beamforming can achieve the maximal throughput only if the SNR of the CSI feedback is sufficiently large. With a new throughput metric, a necessary condition for the optimality of beamforming is determined, and the necessary and sufficient condition is numerically found with the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature method. Analysis of beamforming transmission shows that at a fairly high SNR for CSI feedback the rate allocation needs to be reduced, while at low SNR for CSI feedback, the allocated rate should be increased. When two-mode transmission is adopted, beamforming may be preferred over spatial diversity even when the necessary condition for the optimality of beamforming is not met.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506255.pdf","endPage":"830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput effects of noisy feedback of channel state information in multiple-antenna systems","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506255","startPage":"826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Throughput effects of noisy feedback of channel state information in multiple-antenna systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506255/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8670296","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506255/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput effects of noisy feedback of channel state information in multiple-antenna systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058536S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506257,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The array antenna and MIMO techniques are developing toward 4th generation mobile communication systems, and the accurate estimation of propagation environment becomes more important. This paper attracts attention to the accurate detection of the number of incident waves which is one of important characteristics in multidirectional communication. There are some recent papers on the accurate detection, but they still have problems of computational cost or estimation accuracy in severe environment like low SNR, small number of snapshots or adjacent waves. Thus AIC and MDL methods based on information theory are still often used. In this paper, we propose an accurate estimation method of the number of arrival signals using the orthogonality of sub-spaces derived from preliminary estimation of signal sub-space. The proposed method accurately estimates the number of signals especially in severe environments where AIC and MDL methods can hardly estimate.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506258","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","startPage":"840","endPage":"844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate detection of the number of arrival signals using pre-estimated signal subspace","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate detection of the number of arrival signals using pre-estimated signal subspace","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506258/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670299","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate detection of the number of arrival signals using pre-estimated signal subspace","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061178S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506261,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

However, prior works have ignored the rate overhead associated with feedback of MIMO BC channel state information (CSI), which is roughly K times larger than single-user MIMO CSI (i.e., it is O(tr) where r=/spl Sigma//sub k=1//sup K/r/sub k/ and r/sub k/ is the number of antennas at the kth MS). Considering the amount of feedback signaling, quantization is a necessity for effective feedback transmission as a form of partial CSI. In this paper, we propose the greedy multi-channel selection diversity (greedy MCSD) scheme bases on block MMSE QR decomposition with dirty paper coding (block MMSE-DP), where partial CSI is almost sufficient. The sum-rate performance of our novel scheme approaches extremely close to the sum capacity of MIMO BC as the number of users increases, whereas the feedback overhead is reduced by a factor of 2t/sup 3//L(t/sup 2/-t), in which L is the number of active channel vectors. Simulation results validate the expectation from the analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited feedback signaling for MIMO broadcast channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506261","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506261.pdf","startPage":"855","endPage":"859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Limited feedback signaling for MIMO broadcast channels","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506261/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited feedback signaling for MIMO broadcast channels","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071757S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1506262,"authors":[{"name":"X.

However, a long CP costs extra bandwidth and reduces power efficiency. This paper designs a channel shortening filter for differential OFDM systems with unknown multipath channels with long delay spreads. Without introducing extra redundancy, our design shortens the length of the effective channel response and bypasses the channel estimation, thus improving bandwidth and power efficiencies. The design is easy to be implemented at both transmitter and receiver with low computational complexity. Simulation results corroborate the merits of our design.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506262","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506262.pdf","startPage":"860","endPage":"864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel shortening equalization for differential OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506262/","displayDocTitle":"Channel shortening equalization for differential OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506262/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel shortening equalization for differential OFDM systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051381S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1506265,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For such networks, cross-layer design coupled with node cooperation and rate adaptation can significantly reduce both energy consumption and delay. In this paper, we propose a cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique where multiple nodes within a cluster cooperate in signal transmission and reception with optimal rate. In our scheme, local information exchange within the cluster is not necessary if Alamouti codes are used with appropriate transmission scheduling. A cross-layer design framework is then applied that optimizes routing and rate to minimize the energy consumption and delay. For the cooperative MIMO scheme, routing is optimized based on an equivalent non-cooperative system, where each cooperating cluster is treated as a super node. We derive the best energy-delay tradeoff curve under this optimization model and show that the cooperative MIMO approach dramatically improves energy and delay performance, especially when rate adaptation is used.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506282","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","startPage":"960","endPage":"964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer optimization of sensor networks based on cooperative MIMO techniques with rate adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer optimization of sensor networks based on cooperative MIMO techniques with rate adaptation","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506282/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670323","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506282/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer optimization of sensor networks based on cooperative MIMO techniques with rate adaptation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060647S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506284,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our study is motivated by practical considerations that limit the choice of parameters in a real relay network. We show that BPSK modulation suffices to achieve much of the relaying throughput in the SNR range where relaying is most advantageous. We also show that smartly choosing either completely correlated or uncorrelated signals incurs negligible loss in rate compared to optimally correlated signals. Furthermore, the achievable rate is not diminished significantly if we use equal time slots for relay transmission and reception, instead of using the optimum time ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that even when time and correlation are both restricted, relaying with appropriate power control still carries substantial gains over direct and two-hop channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506284.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of achievable rates for half-duplex relay channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN","Binary phase shift keying","Throughput","Power system relaying","Digital relays","Communication systems","Robustness","Power control","Information theory","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","AWGN channels","correlation methods","phase shift keying","power control","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["achievable rate sensitivity","half-duplex relay channel","AWGN channel","source-relay correlation","BPSK modulation","relay transmission","relay reception","optimum time ratio","power control","two-hop channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of achievable rates for half-duplex relay channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506284/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670325","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of achievable rates for half-duplex relay channel","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10057S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1506285,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The scheme builds on recent promising advances realized in the area of multi-user downlink precoding and scheduling based on partial transmitter channel state information (CSIT) using random beamforming-based SDMA. Although random precoding followed by SDMA scheduling is optimal within the set of unitary precoders, it is only so in the asymptotic number of users K. For-practically relevant-sparse networks (i.e., with low to moderate number of users) random beam-forming SDMA yields severely degraded performance. In this work we present a scheme allowing to restore robustness with respect to cell sparsity. The core idea here is to preserve the low complexity low feedback advantage of random opportunistic beamforming in selecting a target group of users, while much more efficient beamforming schemes can be used to serve the group of users once it has been identified. We propose different designs, optimal and suboptimal, based upon variable levels of feedback requirement. We show substantial gain over opportunistic beamforming for a range of K.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506285","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506285.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust multi-user opportunistic beamforming for sparse networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506285/","displayDocTitle":"Robust multi-user opportunistic beamforming for sparse networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506285/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust multi-user opportunistic beamforming for sparse networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05039S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506289,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

Given the constraints of allowing no transmit notch filters, and adequate receive side mitigation of narrow band jammers, we jointly optimize the selection of guard interval length, transmit pulse-shaping and receive side windowing for throughput performance on the average power line channel.

The design objective is to minimize the maximum transmit power on each transmit antenna while satisfying an SINR constraint for each user. This per-antenna power optimization is more realistic than the usual sum-power criterion because in practice each transmit antenna has its own power amplifier. The main contribution of this paper is a uplink-downlink duality result for this new setting. We prove that the optimal downlink transmit beamformers with per-antenna power constraints are identical to the optimal receive beamformers of a dual uplink channel with a uncertain noise. This mirrors our previous result on the capacity region duality with per-antenna power constraints, and it extends the previously known beam-forming duality for sum-power constrained channels. The per-antenna beamforming duality derived in this paper is based on a new interpretation of beamforming duality based on Lagrangian duality. Duality is useful in practice because the uplink problem is typically easier to solve. In the final part of this paper, we propose efficient numerical algorithms to solve the per-antenna problem.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506302","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506302.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink beamforming with per-antenna power constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Downlink beamforming with per-antenna power constraints","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670342","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506302/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink beamforming with per-antenna power constraints","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114727S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506303,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The flexibility and efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through an application of robust estimation.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506308","publicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10050/32243/01506308.pdf","startPage":"1088","endPage":"1092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2005.1506308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized consensus computation in networked systems with erasure links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506308/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized consensus computation in networked systems with erasure links","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670348","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506308/","conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized consensus computation in networked systems with erasure links","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01506308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066742S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10050","isNumber":"32243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10050","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"32243","articleId":"1506308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506394,"authors":[{"name":"H.

On the other hand, because such position data include deeply personal information, the protection of location privacy is one of the most significant problems in location-based services. In this paper, we propose an anonymous communication technique to protect the location privacy of the users of location-based services. In our proposed technique, such users generate several false position data (dummies) to send to service providers with the true position data of users. Because service providers cannot distinguish the true position data, user location privacy is protected. We also describe a cost reduction technique for communication between a client and a server. Moreover, we conducted performance study experiments on our proposed technique using practical position data. As a result of the experiments, we observed that our proposed technique protects the location privacy of people and can sufficiently reduce communication costs so that our communication techniques can be applied in practical location-based services.","doi":"10.1109/PERSER.2005.1506394","publicationTitle":"ICPS '05.

This paper describes a connectionist architecture (framework) and its rationale, in which knowledge embedded in one network may be reused in another. This allows information reuse and integration (inheritance) in the context of information acquired by a neural net. The paper focuses on early (initial) results; some of the aims have been demonstrated and amplified through the experimental work. This also enables us to assess the strength and weakness of the approach. It concludes that the underpinning concepts - inheritance and transformation - are viable and demonstrate the basic feasibility of the architecture (and framework).","doi":"10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506501","startPage":"368","endPage":"373","publicationTitle":"IRI -2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Conf, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32280","displayPublicationTitle":"IRI -2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Conf, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10065/32280/01506501.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information reuse and integration in artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506501/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Information reuse and integration in artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506501/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8689339","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information reuse and integration in artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01506501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105457S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10065","isNumber":"32280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10065","xplore-issue":"32280","articleId":"1506501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1506502,"authors":[{"name":"M.O.

The calculation of future vehicle lateral position is achieved with cooperative modular artificial neural networks, trained using data generated from a known, but somewhat slow, mathematical model. The performance of a single monolithic neural network is compared against a cooperative modular neural network trained with uniform matching criteria. Additionally, an algorithm to calculate a best achievable matching criterion for each network is described and the best achievable matching criterion is combined with a modular network partitioning scheme. The use of cooperative modular artificial neural networks reduces mean error between 46% and 55% compared with the single network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Road vehicles","Road safety","Artificial neural networks","Displays","Vehicle driving","Wheels","Vehicle safety","Road transportation","Snow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicles","road safety","driver information systems","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle steering control","modular neural network","RoadView project","Advanced Highway Maintenance Construction Technology research center","road safety","snow removal","driver information"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506502","startPage":"374","endPage":"379","publicationTitle":"IRI -2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Conf, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IRI -2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Conf, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10065/32280/01506502.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle steering control using modular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle steering control using modular neural networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8689340","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506502/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle steering control using modular neural networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01506502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.349594S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10065","isNumber":"32280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10065","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32280","articleId":"1506502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1506581,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Following a user-defined protocol the system architecture enables sample aspiration, reagent dispensing, mixing, and thermal cycling, with intermediate imaging steps for in-process monitoring of critical fluid delivery steps. A serial pipeline process is used to provide flexibility, reproducibility, and reliability for the reactions prepared. A typical reaction comprises a 0.5 /spl mu/L sample aspirated from a microplate well followed by 1 to 8 reagents dispensed in 40-100 pL droplet volumes using piezoelectric reagent dispensers. Reactions are then mixed to prepare a 2.0 /spl mu/L final reaction volume. Reaction volumes from 0.5-2 /spl mu/L have been demonstrated, representing performance comparable to the state-of-the-art in a majority of core sequencing facilities. A5K has been extensively tested in the preparation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing reactions. Other applications of the A5K platform of technologies include quantitation of minimal residual disease, protein crystallography, and potential for application in drug discovery, forensics, and DNA analysis of environmental samples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Glass","Biochemical analysis","DNA","Amplitude shift keying","Protocols","Monitoring","Pipelines","Reproducibility of results","Testing","Polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","DNA","biological fluid dynamics","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput biochemical analyses","glass capillaries","sample preparation","capillary-based fluid handling system","user-defined protocol","sample aspiration","reagent dispensing","mixing","thermal cycling","intermediate imaging steps","in-process monitoring","serial pipeline process","piezoelectric reagent dispensers","deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction","DNA sequencing reactions","minimal residual disease","protein crystallography","8 hr"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COASE.2005.1506737","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10067/32283/01506737.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2005.1506737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample preparation in glass capillaries for high-throughput biochemical analyses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample preparation in glass capillaries for high-throughput biochemical analyses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506737/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506737/","accessionNumber":"8661820","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample preparation in glass capillaries for high-throughput biochemical analyses","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01506737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067238S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10067","isNumber":"32283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10067","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32283","articleId":"1506737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1506755,"authors":[{"name":"Yangmin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"lastName":"Yangmin Li","id":"37279899000"},{"name":"Qingsong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"lastName":"Qingsong Xu","id":"37290823000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9425-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-8070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-8089"}],"articleNumber":"1506755","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Micromanipulators","Kinematics","Fasteners","Atomic force microscopy","Manufacturing","Nanoelectromechanical systems","Assembly","Manipulators","Two dimensional displays","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","micromanipulators","manipulator kinematics","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanomanipulation","2-DOF compliant parallel micromanipulator","optimal design","piezo-actuators","flexure hinges","kinematic optimization","compliant mechanism","PRB model"]}],"abstract":"A new two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) compliant parallel micromanipulator (CPM) utilizing flexure joints has been proposed for two-dimensional (2-D) nanomanipulation in this paper.

The defective regions were usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Dozens of people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions leading to a significant amount of personnel cost. In addition, potential misjudgment may introduce due to human fatigue. In this paper, a two-layer Hopfield neural network called the competitive Hopfield wafer-defect detection neural network (CHWDNN) is proposed to detect the defective regions of wafer image. The CHWDNN extends the one-layer 2-D Hopfield neural network at the original image plane to a two-layer 3-D Hopfield neural network with defect detection to be implemented on its third dimension. With the extended 3-D architecture, the network is capable of incorporating a pixel's spatial information into a pixel-classifying procedure. The experimental results show the CHWDNN successfully identifies the defective regions on wafers images with good performances.","doi":"10.1109/COASE.2005.1506786","startPage":"301","endPage":"306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10067/32283/01506786.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COASE.2005.1506786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a two-layer competitive Hopfield neural network for semiconductor wafer defect detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Inspection","Neural networks","Costs","Circuit testing","Scanning electron microscopy","Personnel","Humans","Fatigue","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","semiconductor device manufacture","object detection","image recognition","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-layer competitive Hopfield neural network","semiconductor wafer defect detection","scanning electron microscope","wafer image","pixel-classifying procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Using a two-layer competitive Hopfield neural network for semiconductor wafer defect detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8671319","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a two-layer competitive Hopfield neural network for semiconductor wafer defect detection","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01506786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057872S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10067","isNumber":"32283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10067","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32283","articleId":"1506786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1506788,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

Basic signal statistics (mean and standard deviation) are used for membership function construction, and fuzzy c-means (FCMs) data clustering is used to automate the construction of a simple amplitude-driven inference rule base. The result is a system that is transparent to, and easily \"tweaked\" by, the prosthetist/clinician. Other algorithms in current literature assume a longer period of unperceivable delay, while the system we present has an update rate of 45.7 ms with little postprocessing time, making it suitable for real-time application. Five subjects were investigated (three with intact limbs, one with a unilateral transradial amputation, and one with a unilateral transradial limb-deficiency from birth). Four subjects were used for system offline analysis, and the remaining intact-limbed subject was used for system real-time analysis. We discriminated between four EMG patterns for subjects with intact limbs, and between three patterns for limb-deficient subjects. Overall classification rates ranged from 94% to 99%. The fuzzy algorithm also demonstrated success in real-time classification, both during steady state motions and motion state transitioning. This functionality allows for seamless control of multiple degrees-of-freedom in a multifunctional prosthesis.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2005.847357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/32284/01506815.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2005.847357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32284","startPage":"280","endPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic fuzzy logic approach to EMG pattern recognition for multifunctional prosthesis control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic fuzzy logic approach to EMG pattern recognition for multifunctional prosthesis control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8576738","pubMedId":"16200752","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506815/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic fuzzy logic approach to EMG pattern recognition for multifunctional prosthesis control","sourcePdf":"01506815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103056S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"32284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"278","xplore-issue":"32284","articleId":"1506815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506819,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Preliminary experiments aimed at testing the proposed system and gaining insight into the potential of EMG-triggered, robot-assisted therapy are reported.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customized interactive robotic treatment for stroke: EMG-triggered therapy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2005.850423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/32284/01506819.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2005.850423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Customized interactive robotic treatment for stroke: EMG-triggered therapy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1506819/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8576742","pubMedId":"16200756","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customized interactive robotic treatment for stroke: EMG-triggered therapy","sourcePdf":"01506819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154751S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"32284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"32284","articleId":"1506819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1506823,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

In the standard one-dimensional application, the cursor moves horizontally from left to right at a fixed rate while vertical cursor movement is continuously controlled by sensorimotor rhythm amplitude. The right edge of the screen is divided among 2-6 targets, and the user's goal is to control vertical cursor movement so that the cursor hits the correct target when it reaches the right edge. Up to the present, vertical cursor movement has been a linear function of amplitude in a specific frequency band [i.e., 8-12 Hz (mu) or 18-26 Hz (beta)] over left and/or right sensorimotor cortex. The present study evaluated the effect of controlling cursor movement with a weighted combination of these amplitudes in which the weights were determined by an regression algorithm on the basis of the user's past performance. Analyses of data obtained from a representative set of trained users indicated that weighted combinations of sensorimotor rhythm amplitudes could support cursor control significantly superior to that provided by a single feature. Inclusion of an interaction term further improved performance. Subsequent online testing of the regression algorithm confirmed the improved performance predicted by the offline analyses. The results demonstrate the substantial value for brain-computer interface applications of simple multivariate linear algorithms. In contrast to many classification algorithms, such linear algorithms can easily incorporate multiple signal features, can readily adapt to changes in the user's control of these features, and can accommodate additional targets without major modifications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface (BCI): feature selection by regression improves performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2005.848627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/32284/01506823.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2005.848627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface (BCI): feature selection by regression improves performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1506823/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8576746","pubMedId":"16200760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interface (BCI): feature selection by regression improves performance","sourcePdf":"01506823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102446S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"32284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"32284","articleId":"1506823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506824,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The application of robotics and automation technology can serve to assist, enhance, evaluate, and document neurological and orthopedic rehabilitation. This paper deals with the application of \"patient-cooperative\" techniques to robot-aided gait rehabilitation of neurological disorders. We define patient-cooperative to mean that, during movement, the technical system takes into account the patient's intention and voluntary efforts rather than imposing any predefined movements or inflexible strategies. It is hypothesized that such cooperative robotic approaches can improve the therapeutic outcome compared to classical rehabilitation strategies. New cooperative strategies are presented that detect the patient's voluntary efforts. First, this enables the patient increased freedom of movement by a certain amount of robot compliance. Second, the robot behavior adapts to the existing voluntary motor abilities. And third, the robotic system displays and improves the patient contribution by visual biofeedback. Initial experimental results are presented to evaluate the basic principle and technical function of proposed approaches. Further improvements of the technical design and additional clinical testing is required to prove whether the therapeutic outcome can be enhanced by such cooperative strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2005.848628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2005.848628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/32284/01506824.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patient-cooperative strategies for robot-aided treadmill training: first experimental results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"Patient-cooperative strategies for robot-aided treadmill training: first experimental results","volume":"13","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506824/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8576747","pubMedId":"16200761","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506824/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patient-cooperative strategies for robot-aided treadmill training: first experimental results","sourcePdf":"01506824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109214S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"32284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"477","xplore-issue":"32284","articleId":"1506824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1506825,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Ferromagnetic materials or other magnetic fields near the sensor module disturb the local earth magnetic field and, therefore, the orientation estimation, which impedes many (ambulatory) applications. In the filter, the gyroscope bias error, orientation error, and magnetic disturbance error are estimated. The filter was tested under quasi-static and dynamic conditions with ferromagnetic materials close to the sensor module. The quasi-static experiments implied static positions and rotations around the three axes. In the dynamic experiments, three-dimensional rotations were performed near a metal tool case. The orientation estimated by the filter was compared with the orientation obtained with an optical reference system Vicon. Results show accurate and drift-free orientation estimates.

Axons of different diameters (1-20 /spl mu/m) can be blocked when the stimulation frequency is above 4 kHz. At higher frequency, a higher stimulation intensity is needed to block nerve conduction. Larger diameter axons have a lower threshold intensity for conduction block. High-frequency sinusoidal electrical currents are less effective in blocking nerve conduction than biphasic square pulses of the same frequency. The activation of potassium channels, rather than inactivation of sodium channels, is the possible mechanism underlying the nerve conduction block of the unmyelinated axon induced by high-frequency biphasic (sinusoidal or square pulse) stimulation. This simulation study, which provides more information about the axonal conduction block induced by high-frequency sinusoidal currents, can guide future animal experiments, as well as optimize stimulation waveforms for electrical nerve block in possible clinical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2005.847356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/32284/01506827.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2005.847356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506827/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of nerve block by high-frequency sinusoidal electrical current based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8576750","pubMedId":"16200764","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506827/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of nerve block by high-frequency sinusoidal electrical current based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model","sourcePdf":"01506827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073339S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"32284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"32284","articleId":"1506827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506835,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wen","affiliation":["World Wide Packets, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bo Wen received the M.S. degree in computer science from Washington State University, Pullman, in 2001.

In a conventional WR network, an entire wavelength is assigned to a given connection (or session). This can lead to lower channel utilization when individual sessions do not need the entire channel bandwidth. This paper considers a TDM-based approach to reduce this inefficiency, where multiple connections are multiplexed onto each wavelength channel. The resultant network is a TDM-based WR network (TWRN), where the wavelength bandwidth is partitioned into fixed-length time slots organized as a fixed-length frame. Provisioning a connection in such a network involves determining a time-slot assignment, in addition to the route and wavelength. This problem is defined as the routing, wavelength, and time-slot-assignment (RWTA) problem. In this paper, we present a family of RWTA algorithms and study the resulting blocking performance. For routing, we use the existing shortest path routing algorithm with a new link cost function called least resistance weight (LRW) function, which incorporates wavelength-utilization information. For wavelength assignment, we employ the existing least loaded (LL) wavelength selection; and for time-slot allocation, we present the LL time-slot (LLT) algorithm with different variations. Simulation-based analyses are used to compare the proposed TDM architecture to traditional WR networks, both with and without wavelength conversion. The objective is to compare the benefits of TDM and wavelength conversion, relative to WR networks, towards improving performance. The results show that the use of TDM provides substantial gains, especially for multifiber networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.854039","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/32285/01506835.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.854039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32285","startPage":"2598","endPage":"2609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing, wavelength and time-slot-assignment algorithms for wavelength-routed optical WDM/TDM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Routing, wavelength and time-slot-assignment algorithms for wavelength-routed optical WDM/TDM networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8591167","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506835/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing, wavelength and time-slot-assignment algorithms for wavelength-routed optical WDM/TDM networks","sourcePdf":"01506835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091195S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"32285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"32285","articleId":"1506835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506842,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The irregular LDPC codes has different row-weight variances of a parity-check matrix from 10.9 to 18.8 and a row-weight mean of 60. Simulation is carried out under various conditions including the impairment factors such as dispersion, polarization-mode dispersion (PMD), and fiber nonlinearities. Results suggest that the irregular LDPC code with a low row-weight variance (=10.9) generally has better performance for the most impairment factors except for the factor of dispersion. On the other hand, for the factor of dispersion the irregular LDPC code performs better with a high row-weight variance (=18.8). A specific LDPC code can overcome the impairment limits in a deployed link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","volume":"23","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8591175","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506843/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BER performance due to irregularity of row-weight distribution of the parity-check matrix in irregular LDPC codes for 10-gb/s optical signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance due to irregularity of row-weight distribution of the parity-check matrix in irregular LDPC codes for 10-gb/s optical signals","sourcePdf":"01506843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073634S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"32285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32285","articleId":"1506843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1506845,"authors":[{"name":"Guohua Qi","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/32285/1506845/1506845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guohua Qi received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1986 and 1989, respectively.

We demonstrate theoretically that the odd-order electrical harmonics are cancelled and even-order electrical harmonics are generated at the output of a photodetector when the optical carrier is filtered out from the phase-modulated optical spectrum. Analysis shows that dispersion compensation is required in order to maintain the suppression of the odd-order electrical harmonics, in order to eliminate signal fading of the generated electrical signal when the optical signal is distributed using conventional single-mode optical fiber. It is experimentally demonstrated that, when the electrical drive signal is tuned from 18.8-25 GHz, two bands of mm-wave signals from 37.6 to 50 GHz and from 75.2 to 100 GHz with high signal quality are generated locally and remotely. This approach does not suffer from the direct current (dc) bias-drifting problem observed when an optical intensity modulator is used.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2005.854067","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/32285/01506845.pdf","startPage":"2687","endPage":"2695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2005.854067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical generation and distribution of continuously tunable millimeter-wave signals using an optical phase modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506845/","displayDocTitle":"Optical generation and distribution of continuously tunable millimeter-wave signals using an optical phase modulator","volume":"23","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8591177","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506845/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical generation and distribution of continuously tunable millimeter-wave signals using an optical phase modulator","sourcePdf":"01506845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052966S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"32285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"32285","articleId":"1506845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506850,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In the present investigation, two different formulations of particle-free conductive solutions are introduced that are low in cost, easy to deposit, and possess good electrical properties. A novel aqueous solution consisting of silver nitrate and additives is initially described. This solution demonstrates excellent adherence to glass and polymers and has an electrical resistivity only 2.9 times that of bulk silver after curing. A metallo-organic decomposition (MOD) ink is subsequently introduced. This ink produces a close-packed silver crystal microstructure after low-temperature thermolysis and subsequent high-temperature annealing. The electrical conductance of the final consolidated trace produced with the MOD ink is very close to bulk silver. In addition, the traces produced with the MOD material exhibit excellent wear and fracture resistance. When utilized in a specialized continuous inkjet (CIJ) printing technology system, both particle-free solution inks are able to produce conductive traces in three dimensions. The importance of three-dimensional (3-D) printing of conductive traces is finally discussed in relation to the broad range of applications in the freeform fabrication industry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506874/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8576601","volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Formulation and processing of novel conductive solution inks in continuous inkjet printing of 3-D electric circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formulation and processing of novel conductive solution inks in continuous inkjet printing of 3-D electric circuits","sourcePdf":"01506874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061882S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"32286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"32286","articleId":"1506874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506887,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Because supply voltages have hardly been reduced however, circuits operating at a supply voltage above the collector-emitter breakdown voltage (BV/sub CEO/) are common practice today and collector-base avalanche currents are therefore of major concern. Transistors that need to handle a collector-emitter voltage above (BV/sub CEO/) are typically found as output transistors in output driver stages and in bias current circuits. Such circuits can be designed to tolerate collector-emitter voltages above (BV/sub CEO/) by driving the base terminal with a relatively low impedance. This paper analyzes various conventional as well as two new bias current circuits supporting operation at collector voltages above (BV/sub CEO/). In the new circuits, feedforward and feedback avalanche current compensation techniques are introduced that obtain a substantial increase in output breakdown voltage of the bias circuits and improve the accuracy of the current mirror at output voltages above (BV/sub CEO/). With the feedback technique, a measured increase in output breakdown voltage by more than 2 V is demonstrated while the accuracy of the current mirror ratio at output voltages of 2 to 3 times (BV/sub CEO/) is improved by an order of magnitude.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32287/01506888.pdf","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2018","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyses and design of bias circuits tolerating output voltages above BV/sub CEO/","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Analyses and design of bias circuits tolerating output voltages above BV/sub CEO/","volume":"40","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1506888/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8577057","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyses and design of bias circuits tolerating output voltages above BV/sub CEO/","sourcePdf":"01506888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074865S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"32287","articleId":"1506888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1506890,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It operates up to 30 Gb/s and stands out for a maximum (nonlinear) transimpedance in the limiting mode of 25 k/spl Omega/, resulting in a gain /spl times/ speed product as high as 750 k/spl Omega//spl middot/Gb/s. This record value could be achieved by applying several techniques for suppression of noise coupling simultaneously. The effectiveness of each technique was verified experimentally by measuring the output eye diagrams of different mounted amplifier versions. The high accuracy potential of the substrate modeling tools applied for optimizing the amplifier design has been demonstrated separately by measurements on special (mounted) test structures up to 40 GHz. These investigations also showed the strong degradation of shielding measures by bond inductances with increasing frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506891/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8577060","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Substrate coupling in a high-gain 30-Gb/s SiGe amplifier-modeling, suppression, and measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Substrate coupling in a high-gain 30-Gb/s SiGe amplifier-modeling, suppression, and measurement","sourcePdf":"01506891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059715S","chronDate":"Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32287","articleId":"1506891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1506894,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The HFET employed achieves reduction in a gate leakage current while maintaining a high maximum drain current. For precise design of an amplifier, large-signal FET model parameters are extracted using pulsed I-V and S-parameter measurements. Based on this model, second harmonic impedances as well as fundamental impedances are determined for obtaining high efficiency and input- and output-matching circuits which are assembled in a compact package are designed to achieve a high-efficiency internally matched amplifier. As a result, the amplifier delivers a high saturated output power of 70 W and a high power-added efficiency of 51%. These characteristics are the record power performance in C-band in terms of simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency.

The model enables the magnetic field distribution in the air gap and magnet regions to be determined, by neglecting the eddy-current redistribution effect and assuming that the eddy currents are resistance limited. It can account for space-harmonic magnetomotive forces (MMFs) resulting from the winding distribution and time-harmonic MMFs due to nonsinusoidal phase currents, as well as for the effect of curvature and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. We have validated the model by finite-element analysis, and used it to investigate the eddy-current loss in the magnets of three surface-mounted magnet brushless motors that have similar slot and pole numbers, and employ identical rotors but different stators, when they are operated in brushless ac (BLAC) and dc (BLDC) modes.

For a random-chopping comparator, the polarity of its offset is detected by observing the code density of its comparison results. Binary feedback is then used to digitally adjust the comparator's offset so that the offset is minimized. All calibration procedures are performed in the digital domain. The calibration performance is characterized by the converging speed of the feedback loop and the offset fluctuation due to the disturbance of the ADC's input. These two performance indexes of a background-calibrated comparator (BCC) are determined by three parameters: the probabilistic distribution of the ADC's input, the BCC's offset quantized step size, and the threshold of an internal bilateral peak detector. The offset fluctuation of a BCC can be drastically reduced by employing a windowing mechanism. The use of windowed BCCs in a flash ADC can introduce nonmonotonic-threshold (NMT) effects which include an increase in calibration settling time and an increase in /spl sigma/(V/sub OS/). The use of uncorrelated random chopping for neighboring BCCs can ensure the validity of offset detection and mitigate the NMT effects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/32290/01506973.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.852198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.852198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A background comparator calibration technique for flash analog-to-digital converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Analog-digital conversion","Circuits","Fluctuations","Linearity","Degradation","Voltage","Feedback loop","Performance analysis","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","comparators (circuits)","calibration","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog to digital converters","code density","binary feedback","background calibrated comparator","probabilistic distribution","internal bilateral peak detector","offset fluctuation","windowing mechanism","flash ADC","nonmonotonic threshold effects","offset detection","NMT effects","offset calibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Comparator","flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","offset calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","displayDocTitle":"A background comparator calibration technique for flash analog-to-digital converters","volume":"52","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1506973/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8700084","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A background comparator calibration technique for flash analog-to-digital converters","sourcePdf":"01506973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061013S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"32290","articleId":"1506973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506975,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Sum Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/32290/1506975/1506975-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Sum Lee (M'99) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1957.

This cancellation is achieved by using two paths and exploiting phase differences of 180/spl deg/ between the paths. The question addressed in this paper is: what distortion products (harmonics and intermodulation products) are canceled if more than two paths (and phases) are used? These circuits are called polyphase multipath circuits. It turns out that the more paths (and phases) are used, the more distortion products are canceled. Unfortunately, some intermodulation products cannot be canceled without also canceling the desired signal. An analysis of the impact of mismatch between the paths shows that the suppression of distortion products will be larger if more paths are used. As an application example, the design of an upconversion mixer with a clean output spectrum is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","volume":"52","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"8700090","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1506979/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distortion cancellation by polyphase multipath circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion cancellation by polyphase multipath circuits","sourcePdf":"01506979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054498S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"32290","articleId":"1506979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506980,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Three different circuit techniques for the modulator implementation are considered: switched-capacitor, switched-current and continuous-time. The behavioral models of these circuits, that take into account the most critical limiting factors, have been incorporated into the SIMULINK environment by using S-function blocks, which drastically increase the computational efficiency. The precision of these models has been validated by electrical simulations using HSPICE and experimental measurements from several silicon prototypes. The combination of high accuracy, short CPU time and interoperability of different circuit models together with the efficiency of the optimization engine makes the proposed tool an advantageous alternative for /spl Sigma//spl Delta/M synthesis. The implementation on the well-known MATLAB/SIMULINK platform brings numerous advantages in terms of data manipulation, processing capabilities, flexibility and simulation with other electronic subsystems.

It is also applicable to digital signal processing tasks involving multiplications with a set of constants. The main component of our proposed CSDC method is to combine the strength of the augmented differential coefficient approach and subexpression sharing. Exploring computation reuse through algorithmic equivalence, the augmented differential coefficient approach greatly expands the design space by employing both differences and sums of filter coefficients. The expanded design space is represented by an undirected and complete graph. The problem of minimizing the adder cost (the number of additions/subtractions) for a given filter is transformed into a problem of searching for an appropriate subexpression set that leads to a minimal adder cost. A heuristic search algorithm based on genetic algorithm is developed to search for low-complexity solutions over the expanded design space in conjunction with exploring subexpression sharing. It is shown that up to 70.1% reduction in the adder cost can be obtained over the conventional multiplierless implementation. Comparison with several existing techniques based on the available data shows that our method yields comparable results for multiplierless FIR filter implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.852208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/32290/01506984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.852208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32290","startPage":"1845","endPage":"1853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CSDC: a new complexity reduction technique for multiplierless implementation of digital FIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1506984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CSDC: a new complexity reduction technique for multiplierless implementation of digital FIR filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8700095","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSDC: a new complexity reduction technique for multiplierless implementation of digital FIR filters","sourcePdf":"01506984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078309S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"32290","articleId":"1506984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1506985,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/32290/1506985/1506985-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kun Yuan was born in Henan Province, China, in 1980.

They are constructed by merging subbands in a uniform FB with sets of transmultiplexers (TMUXs). It generalizes the RNFBs previously proposed by the authors to allow more general choice of the sampling factors. The spectral inversion and spurious response suppression problems of these new RNFBs using cosine modulation are analyzed, and a simple design method based on a matching condition is proposed. It is also found that the FB and the TMUX in the recombination structure can be designed separately to satisfy the matching condition. In addition, real-time adaptive merging of the channels to provide dynamic nonuniform frequency partitioning is feasible. Another advantage of the RNFBs is that the recombination and processing of the subband signal can be done at the decimated domain of the uniform FB, which greatly reduces its implementation complexity. Design examples show that high quality nonuniform PR FBs with low implementation complexity and variable time-frequency resolution can be obtained by the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1506995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1506995/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8700106","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of perfect-reconstruction nonuniform recombination filter banks with flexible rational sampling factors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of perfect-reconstruction nonuniform recombination filter banks with flexible rational sampling factors","sourcePdf":"01506995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07716S","chronDate":"Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"32290","articleId":"1506995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1506996,"authors":[{"name":"N.E.

These approaches aimed to find a minimal set of genes that were able to accurately predict the expression levels of a given gene, thus modeling the interactions in the underlying genetic regulatory networks. Two neural network architectures were employed in each approach to determine the robustness of the modeling procedure with respect to the network architecture. Two testing procedures were also devised to evaluate the trained neural networks' performance and generalizability. The resulting neural networks predicted, with high accuracy, the target gene expression level at future times given the predicted minimal gene-set expression levels at previous time points","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2005.1507116","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

The scheduled controller requires only three easily accessible parameters: the total input power, the desired and instantaneous total EDFA gains of the signals. This scheduling scheme can stabilize the output signals from an EDFA in less than 1 ms when there is up to 90% drop in the total input signal power.

Recently, the static series synchronous compensator (SSSC) has shown its ability to improve power oscillation damping (POD). Because of the nonlinear dynamics associated with the SSSC, and effective interactions among its variables, conventional linear control techniques result in poor control performance. In this paper, a novel input affine nonlinear and multivariable model for a transmission line installed with an SSSC is developed. Then, a nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) feedback linearized controller is proposed to improve POD.

Micro-electromechanical (MEMS) optical switches are miniature devices that use tiny mirrors to alter the path of light. These switches enable all-optical capability, are small and compact, and cheap to fabricate. However, many torsion mirror optical switches are activated by electrostatic actuators that exhibit a pull-in phenomena which greatly effects system stability. The pull-in phenomena occurs when the gap between the electrodes in the actuator is reduced to less than two thirds of the original value thereby causing an uncontrolled contraction between the two sides the capacitor. This paper describes how a backpropagation neural network can be used to control an electrostatically actuated optical switch without using stiff suspension systems or mechanical stops. The two-layer network is applied to both single input and dual input MEMS torsion mirror optical switches. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate how the proposed scheme allows the switching mechanism to operate in a stable range and avoid the effect of pull-in phenomena","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2005.1507216","startPage":"737","endPage":"742","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

Several electronic devices have been developed to assist clinicians in monitoring and diagnosing heart diseases. Ballistocardiography (BCG) was one of popular methods before the 1970s but after that other methods have replaced it, partly because the devices were difficult to construct. Recently developed sensors offer new unobtrusive possibilities to evaluate the condition of the patient's heart even at home without attaching electrodes to the patient. Thus, it is suitable for evaluation of the heart condition in any place because of being user-friendly method. In this study, we applied compactly supported (Daubechies as well as biorthogonal) wavelet transforms in a comparison way to extract essential features of the BCG signal and neural networks to classify the BCG. Initial tests with BCG from six subjects indicate that the method can classify the subjects to three classes with a high accuracy. The method is almost insensitive to latency and non-linear disturbance. Moreover, the wavelet transform requires no prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of data samples and the computational complexity and training time are reduced","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2005.1507234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

Compliance controllers demand high precision force measurement that can be delivered by commercial force/torque sensors. However, these sensors are expensive, rather bulky and vulnerable to impact forces. A common solution to this dilemma is the use of force observers, which estimate external forces using full knowledge about system dynamics. However, some robotic systems have complicated dynamics that may or may not be known entirely and precisely. In these situations the implementation of dynamic observers would not result in accurate force estimation. This paper proposes the use of neural networks in an inverse dynamics based force observation without the need for complete determination of system dynamics. We also show that for slow operations on soft environments, the observer estimates external forces without acceleration input","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2005.1507264","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1026","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

However, due to the existing delays in the communication channel, transparent performance and stability are compromised. This paper presents a new class of teleoperation predictive controllers, in which the dynamics of the environment is mapped and simulated at the master side using two neural networks. The supervised network at the slave side is trained online to generate environment contact force using slave contact position and force. The master network whose gains are adaptively updated online with the transmitted slave network gains, replicate the environment force using master position. The estimated environment force is utilized in a \"pseudo\" two-channel force-position bilateral teleoperation control architecture. The proposed controller does not require an environment model to reflect environment dynamics for transparency. Thus, it can be used for operations on unstructured environments displaying varying nonlinear dynamic behavior. The improved performance of the new teleoperation architecture in comparison with that of a conventional two-channel force-position architecture that uses measured environment force for feedback is verified on a teleoperation test-bed consisting of two planar Twin-Pantograph haptic devices","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2005.1507306","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1274","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

This paper studies the control of an electro-hydraulic active suspension, based on the backstepping control strategy. Our goal is to control the car vertical motion and keep it to zero, in order to ensure passengers' comfort. The active suspension model is highly non-linear and non-differentiable due to the hydraulic components, especially the servo-valve. Moreover, in most studies, it was always assumed that the chamber volume of the hydraulic actuator is constant, while in fact the volume varies with the piston motion. This induces an additional non-linear term to the classic model. Therefore, a powerful control strategy is needed, and the backstepping is used here for being a powerful non-linear approach able to overwhelm all these facets. However, choosing the car vertical motion as the control variable results in an unstable zero dynamics; hence, it is often combined with another variable such as the suspension travel or the vertical acceleration. To remedy this problem, we introduced a damping term in the mathematical model to ensure that zero dynamics will remain stable regardless of the control variable choice. As it will be demonstrated, the backstepping used with the model we established is an ideal drive by wire control to compensate road fluctuations","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2005.1507358","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2005 IEEE Conference on Control Applications, 2005.

In the framework of PFs, the accuracy of this estimation depends on the choice of the proposal distribution, which is the problem that is addressed in this paper. Here, we propose a novel particle filtering algorithm which is based on state partitioning and a bank of extended Kalman filters to render a more accurate proposal distribution and hence yielding a more precise estimation of the state.

To address this, a reconfigurable technique based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) may be applied, which has the potential for greater functionality and higher performance, but with smaller volume and lower power dissipation. This project investigates an FPGA-based PID motion control system for small, self-adaptive systems. For one channel control, parallel and serial architectures for the PID control algorithm are designed and implemented. Based on these one-channel designs, four architectures for multiple-channel control are proposed and two channel-level serial (CLS) architectures are designed and implemented. Functional correctness of all the designs was verified in motor control experiments, and area, speed, and power consumption were analyzed. The tradeoffs between the different designs are discussed in terms of area, power consumption, and execution time with respect to number of channels, sampling rate, and control clock frequency.

The concept of a small, rotorcraft which draws its power from the lines is introduced here. Some of its advantages compared with a free-flying aircraft are discussed. Achieving the required degree of autonomy and reliable power pick-up needs good control of the position and attitude of the vehicle relative to the overhead line. The paper considers an artificial-vision system, based on the Hough transform, for this purpose. A laboratory test rig is described which incorporates a dynamic model for a small, ducted-fan rotorcraft so that the response of the vehicle to wind gusts can be emulated.

Energy limitation is one of the most important challenges for mobile robots. Most existing studies on mobile robots focus on motion planning to reduce motion power. However, motion is not the only power consumer. In this paper, we present a case study of a mobile robot called Pioneer 3DX. We analyze the energy consumers. We build power models for motion, sonar sensing and control based on experimental results. The results show that motion consume less than 50% power on average. Therefore, it is important to consider the other components in energy-efficient designs. We introduce two energy-conservation techniques: dynamic power management and real-time scheduling. We provide several examples showing how these techniques can be applied to robots. These techniques together with motion planning provide greater opportunities to achieve better energy efficiency for mobile robots. Although our study is based on a specific robot, the approach can be applied to other types of robots","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.2005.1507454","publicationTitle":"ICAR '05.

The model was developed for, and experimentally validated on, a neurobotic platform for manipulation. The proposed approach is based on a biologically-inspired model, which replicates the human brain capability of creating associations between motor and sensory data, by learning. The model is implemented here by self-organizing neural maps. During learning, the system creates relations between the motor data associated to endogenous movements performed by the robotic arm and the sensory consequences of such motor actions, i.e. the final position of the end effector. The learnt relations are stored in the neural map structure and are then used, after learning, for generating motor commands aimed at reaching a given point in 3D space. The approach proposed here allows to solve the inverse kinematics and joint redundancy problems for different robotic arms, with good accuracy and robustness. In order to validate this, the same implementation has been tested on a PUMA robot, too. Experimental trials confirmed the system capability to control the end effector position and also to manage the redundancy of the robotic manipulator in reaching the 3D target point even with additional constraints, such as one or more clamped joints, tools of variable lengths, or no visual feedback, without additional learning phases","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired sensory-motor neural model for a neuro-robotic manipulation platform","publicationTitle":"ICAR '05.

In this contribution, linear equalization techniques are compared on a unidirectional driven cable, where only far-end crosstalk occurs. The performance of a conventional equalizer per wire pair only compensates the intersymbol interference and is limited by the crosstalk disturbance, which essentially depends on the number of disturbing wire pairs. Furthermore, a multidimensional equalizer is presented, which is able to compensate both the intersymbol and the far-end crosstalk interference. It is shown that, using this multidimensional equalizer, the bit-error rate can be improved compared to conventional equalizers, which only compensate the cable frequency response.

Unfortunately, continual changes induce uncertainty that limits the applicability of conventional verification and validation (V&V) techniques to assure the reliable performance of such systems. At the system input layer, novel data may cause unstable learning behavior, which may contribute to system failures. Thus, the changes at the input layer must be observed, diagnosed, accommodated and well understood prior to system deployment. Moreover, at the system output layer, the uncertainties/novelties existing in the neural network predictions also need to be well analyzed and detected during system operation. Our research tackles the novelty detection problem at both layers using two different methods. We use a statistical learning tool, support vector data description (SVDD), as a one-class classifier to examine the data entering the adaptive component and detect unforeseen patterns that may cause abrupt system functionality changes. At the output layer, we define a reliability-like measure, the validity index. The validity index reflects the degree of novelty associated with each output and thus can be used to perform system validity checks. Simulations demonstrate that both techniques effectively detect unusual events and provide validation inferences in a near-real time manner.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSAC.2005.113","pdfPath":"/iel5/10076/32309/01508096.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'05)","publicationTitle":"29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2005.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novelty detection for a neural network-based online adaptive system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Novelty detection for a neural network-based online adaptive system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8670111","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508096/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novelty detection for a neural network-based online adaptive system","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01508096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.155457S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10076","isNumber":"32309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10076","xplore-issue":"32309","articleId":"1508096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1508128,"authors":[{"name":"N.

One of the most serious issues is related to circuit layout, as conventional lithographic techniques do not scale to the molecular level. A second important issue concerns fault tolerance: molecular-scale devices will be subject to fault densities that are orders of magnitude greater than silicon-based circuits. In our work, we are investigating a different approach to the design of complex computing systems, inspired by the developmental process of multi-cellular organisms in nature. This approach has led us to define a hierarchical system based on several levels of complexity, ranging from the molecule (modeled by an element of a programmable logic device when the system is applied to silicon) to the organism, defined as an application-specific multi-processor system. By setting aside some of the conventional circuit design priorities, namely size and (to a certain extent) performance, we are able to design fully scalable systems endowed with some properties not commonly found in digital circuits. Most notably, by exploiting a hierarchical self-repair approach, our systems are able to tolerate higher fault densities, whereas a self-replication mechanism allows our arrays of processing elements to self-organize, greatly reducing the layout complexity of the system.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2005.56","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10078/32311/01508157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2005.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32311","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired computing architectures: the embryonics approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired computing architectures: the embryonics approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508157/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8642636","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508157/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired computing architectures: the embryonics approach","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"01508157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058683S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10078","isNumber":"32311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10078","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32311","articleId":"1508157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508161,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The functions of A/D conversion and motion estimation are implemented by 0.6 m CMOS processing circuit on chip, and attention modules are implemented off the chip as software currently. Attention modules are taken to improve limited applications of the smart image sensor. If the attention module is integrated on a smart sensor, we can use this sensor for tracking some regions of interest without outputting all pixels. The current smart image sensor responses to the changes of intensity, and uses the integration time to estimate motion. To make up for inherent property of the sensor from circuit design and extend its applications we decide to introduce some perceptive solutions to the image sensor. Attention modules for still and moving images are employed to achieve such purposes. The suggested approach also makes the smart image sensor initiate perceptive functions for such cases that motion estimation or intensity changes are not observed. Experimental results present the possibility that the smart image sensor can extract ROIs and use them when it selectively outputs pixels.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2005.7","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10078/32311/01508163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2005.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32311","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart image sensor with attention modules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A smart image sensor with attention modules","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508163/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8642642","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508163/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart image sensor with attention modules","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"01508163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056358S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10078","isNumber":"32311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10078","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32311","articleId":"1508163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508169,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper explores the mapping of low level feature extraction on one such architecture, the Georgia Tech SIMD Pixel Processor (SIMPil).

Its obvious importance has led to numerous hardware implementations and variations. Images captured directly onto 3D voxel grids are becoming more common, including those from confocal microscopy and medical imaging technologies. To our knowledge, no one has yet addressed correlation as a technique for recognizing 3D templates in such 3D voxel data. We find that this problem includes a number of issues: efficient three-axis rotation of a template with respect to 3D image, large volume of results from the correlation, and the possibility of a template matching an image multiple times. We briefly review techniques that have been used in 2D template matching, and examine analogies to a molecule interaction problem in computational chemistry, including its similarity to multispectral images. We report on a hardware accelerator for the 3D correlation problem, based on a commodity coprocessor board containing field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs). Because the convolution processor is built from reconfigurable logic, it can be adapted to non-linear scoring algorithms using complex data values at each voxel, and can be tailored to solve other problems such as anisotropic grid axes. We present initial performance results for the FPGA implementation, and note that accelerator performance is likely to grow roughly linearly with FPGA capacity, process improvements, and number of FPGAs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2005.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32311","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10078/32311/01508179.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional template correlation: object recognition in 3D voxel data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508179/","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional template correlation: object recognition in 3D voxel data","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8642658","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional template correlation: object recognition in 3D voxel data","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"01508179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064038S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10078","isNumber":"32311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10078","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32311","articleId":"1508179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1508188,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An alternative approach to conventional approaches is provided by the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) paradigm. CNNs have been extensively used in image processing applications: in the past, we developed a still image segmentation technique based on an active contour obtained via single-layer CNNs. This technique suffered from sensitivity to noise as most of edge-based methods: noise may create insignificant false edges or determine some \"edge fragmentation\". The aim of this paper is to re-formulate the algorithm previously proposed in order to step-over the cited weakness. The new formulation is introduced and justified and experimental results are presented. Finally, a competition-based approach for a parameterless version of the presented algorithm is proposed and discussed as an ongoing work.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2005.3","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10078/32311/01508188.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2005.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CNN-based framework for 2D still-image segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508188/","displayDocTitle":"A CNN-based framework for 2D still-image segmentation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8642663","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508188/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CNN-based framework for 2D still-image segmentation","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"01508188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049603S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10078","isNumber":"32311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10078","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32311","articleId":"1508188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1508189,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This monitoring is unacceptable for slowness and lack of objectivity, because the results are related to the ability of the observer to recognize critical situations. The paper presents a prototypal FPGA-based architecture which automatically detects presence/absence of the fastening bolts that fix the rails to the sleepers. A simple predicting algorithm, exploiting the geometry of the railways, extracts, from the long video sequence acquired by a digital line scan camera, few windows where the presence of bolts is expected. These windows are preprocessed according to a Haar transform and then provided to a multilayer perceptron neural classifiers (MLPNCs) which reveals the presence/absence of the fastening bolts with an accuracy of 99.6% in detecting visible bolts and of 95% in detecting missing bolts. A FPGA-based architecture performs these tasks in 13.29 /spl mu/s, allowing an on-the-fly analysis of a video sequence acquired up at 190 km/h.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.2005.4","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10078/32311/01508189.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.2005.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A FPGA-based architecture for automatic hexagonal bolts detection in railway maintenance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508189/","displayDocTitle":"A FPGA-based architecture for automatic hexagonal bolts detection in railway maintenance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8651697","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508189/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA-based architecture for automatic hexagonal bolts detection in railway maintenance","confLoc":"Palermo, Italy","sourcePdf":"01508189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051824S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10078","isNumber":"32311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10078","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32311","articleId":"1508189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508199,"authors":[{"name":"G.

To solve these issues, we propose the Web services approach and discuss how to apply the Web services technology for nucleotide sequence analysis workflow. In this work, we present a program-friendly interface to DNA sequence analysis tools using Web services. All data including query requests to the Web services are managed in XML-formats. The Web services responsible for statistical analysis provide an interface to the R statistical environment and can perform analysis using several statistical methods (including correspondence analysis and principal component analysis). Output of the Web services is in XML-format and, thus, can be stored in local XML databases.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10080/32313/01508339.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'05)","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2005.201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2005.201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web services for DNA sequence analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","DNA","Sequences","Bioinformatics","Statistical analysis","Performance analysis","Application software","Software packages","Principal component analysis","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","Internet","human computer interaction","DNA","XML","statistical analysis","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web services","DNA sequence analysis tools","bioinformatics","nucleotide sequence analysis workflow","program-friendly interface","query requests","statistical analysis","correspondence analysis","principal component analysis","XML databases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Web services for DNA sequence analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508339/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8703882","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"22-26 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web services for DNA sequence analysis","confLoc":"Copenhagen, Denmark","sourcePdf":"01508339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045269S","chronDate":"22-26 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10080","isNumber":"32313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10080","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32313","articleId":"1508339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1508399,"authors":[{"name":"V.

First, we propose a memory reservation scheme which allows any application to reserve a portion of the total system memory pages for its exclusive use. If the application's memory needs exceed its memory reservation, its pages are swapped within its own reservation, thereby containing the performance effects of its memory access profile to its reservation. Swap space for the application is also reserved. A memory reservation can be shared by multiple threads/applications, and reservations can be used hierarchically, with children using only a portion of their parent's reservation. Next, we propose a novel methodology to determine reservation sizes for an embedded task-set that optimizes the overall performance of the system. We also show how an application can leverage customized predictable page-replacement policies to minimize performance penalties from avoidable page faults (\"capacity misses\").","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8651701","htmlLink":"/document/1508442/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware memory firewalling for QoS-sensitive applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware memory firewalling for QoS-sensitive applications","confLoc":"Balearic Islands, Spain","sourcePdf":"01508442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054754S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10081","isNumber":"32314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10081","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32314","articleId":"1508442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1508443,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By virtue of these measures, it was validated effective, efficient and innovative by some experiments on arithmetic circuits, in which we obtained functionally correct circuits with novel structures, fewer logic cells and higher operating speed as compared with results of some conventional or evolutionary approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8669951","htmlLink":"/document/1508483/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive genetic algorithm based approach for evolutionary design and multi-objective optimization of logic circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive genetic algorithm based approach for evolutionary design and multi-objective optimization of logic circuits","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01508483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058744S","chronDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10082","isNumber":"32315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10082","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"32315","articleId":"1508483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1508486,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Department, University of York, Heslington, Yorkshire, UK"],"lastName":"Heng Liu","id":"37558552900"},{"name":"J.F.

Under the CRR technique, an initial population of functionally identical (same input-output behavior), yet physically distinct (alternative design or place-and-route realization) FPGA configurations is produced at design time. At run-time, these individuals compete for selection based on a fitness function favoring fault-free behavior. Hence, any physical resource exhibiting an operationally-significant fault decreases the fitness of those configurations which use it. Through runtime competition, the presence of the fault becomes occluded from the visibility of subsequent FPGA operations. Meanwhile, the offspring formed through crossover and mutation of faulty and viable configurations are reintroduced into the population. This enables evolution of a customized fault-specific repair, realized directly as new configurations using the FPGA's normal throughput processing operations. Multiple phases of the fault handling process including detection, isolation, diagnosis, and recovery are integrated into a single cohesive approach. FPGA-based multipliers are examined as a case study demonstrating evolution of a complete repair for a 3-bit /spl times/ 3-bit multiplier from several stuck-at-faults within a few thousand iterations. Repairs are evolved in-situ, in real-time, without test vectors, while allowing the FPGA to remain partially online.","publicationTitle":"2005 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware (EH'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware (EH'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10082/32315/01508490.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EH.2005.11","doi":"10.1109/EH.2005.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous FPGA fault handling through competitive runtime reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous FPGA fault handling through competitive runtime reconfiguration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508490/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508490/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8669958","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous FPGA fault handling through competitive runtime reconfiguration","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01508490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06868S","chronDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10082","isNumber":"32315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10082","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"32315","articleId":"1508490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1508491,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

If we wish to make the analogy between a biological cell and a digital processor, we should note that nature's approach to parallel processing is subtly different from conventional von Neumann architectures or even from conventional parallel processing approaches, where specialization is obtained by adapting software to a fixed hardware structure. In this article we present the outline of a novel processor architecture based on the Move or TTA (Transport-Triggered Architecture) approach. The features of such architectures allow them to implement systems that more closely resemble, within the limitations imposed by the capabilities of conventional silicon, the general modus operandi of multi-cellular organisms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware (EH'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10082/32315/01508509.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2005 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware (EH'05)","doi":"10.1109/EH.2005.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EH.2005.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Move processor for bio-inspired systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organisms","Hardware","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Silicon","Cells (biology)","Biological systems","Circuits","Evolution (biology)","Embryo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","microprocessor chips","biocomputing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Move processor","bioinspired systems","multicellular organism","biological cell","digital processor","parallel processing","von Neumann architecture","fixed hardware structure","transport triggered architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Move processor for bio-inspired systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8669977","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Move processor for bio-inspired systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01508509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08266S","chronDate":"29 June-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10082","isNumber":"32315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10082","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"32315","articleId":"1508509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1508510,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.W.

We previously introduced the concept of a standard hardware binary, using a just-in-time compiler to compile the hardware binary to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Our JIT compiler includes lean versions of technology mapping, placement, and routing algorithms, of which routing is the most computationally and memory expensive step. As FPGAs continue to increase in size, a JIT FPGA compiler must be capable of efficiently mapping increasingly larger hardware circuits. In this paper, we analyze the scalability of our lean on-chip router, the Riverside on-chip router (ROCR), for routing increasingly large hardware circuits. We demonstrate that ROCR scales well in terms of execution time, memory usage and circuit quality, and we compare the scalability of ROCR to the well known versatile place and route (VPR) timing-driven routing algorithm, comparing to both their standard routing algorithm and their fast routing algorithm. Our results show that on average ROCR executes 3 times faster using 18 times less memory than VPR. ROCR requires only 1% more routing resources, while creating a critical path 30% longer VPR's standard timing-driven router. Furthermore, for the largest hardware circuit, ROCR executes 3 times faster using 14 times less memory, and results in a critical path 2.6% shorter than VPR's fast timing-driven router.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.12","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508526.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the scalability of on-chip routing for just-in-time FPGA compilation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508526/","displayDocTitle":"A study of the scalability of on-chip routing for just-in-time FPGA compilation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508526/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","accessionNumber":"8733152","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the scalability of on-chip routing for just-in-time FPGA compilation","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051781S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508529,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

They are normal realized in software, as pan of an interactive graphics application, such as a video game. Their use in such applications is limited by the computational burden and resource competition they create for a host application. We present the design of a hardware particle machine, for implementation in an FPGA, intended for accelerating real-time panicle graphics in applications such as video games. The particle machine is a system that completely contains, manages, and executes particle graphics simulations and rendering. The particle machine is a system comprised of particle memory, a controller, and the panicle pipe, a pipelined particle update processor. The panicle pipe has been synthesized to 130 MHz, on an Altera Stratix FPGA, resulting in a potential throughput of 2.1 million PPF (panicles per frame). This throughput is achieved with minimal load on application and main system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA particle graphics hardware","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.36","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508529.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"FPGA particle graphics hardware","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508529/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733155","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA particle graphics hardware","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066937S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1508530,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, we present our hardware architecture and numerical algorithms designed to speedup the time-domain finite-difference simulation of linear wave propagation problems in 2D and 3D space on FPGA-based reconfigurable platforms. Application fields of this work include seismic modeling and migration, computational electromagnetics, aeroacoustics, marine acoustics, to name a few. By writing first-order linear wave equations into second-order form, we halve the number of unknowns and simplify the treatment of parameters. We also adopt higher-order finite-difference (FD) schemes to further reduce the number of unknowns at the cost of increasing floating-point computations per discrete grid point. By doing so, we relief the bandwidth requirements between the FPGA and onboard memories but put more burden on the computing engine to take full advantage of FPGA's computational potentials. The speed of our design implemented on a Xilinx ML401 Virtex-4 evaluation platform is about 1.5/spl sim/4 times faster than a pure software implementation of the same algorithm running on a 3.0 GHz DELL workstation. This impressive result is mainly attributed to the memory architecture design, which is well-tuned for our numerical higher-order FD algorithms and can utilize onboard memory bandwidth more wisely. Furthermore, the good scalability of our design makes it compatible with most commercial reconfigurable coprocessor platforms and correspondingly, the performance would be proportional to their onboard memory bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.65","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time domain numerical simulation for transient waves on reconfigurable coprocessor platform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time domain numerical simulation for transient waves on reconfigurable coprocessor platform","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508533/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733159","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508533/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain numerical simulation for transient waves on reconfigurable coprocessor platform","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069456S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1508534,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As real-time operating systems are adopted in the development of many applications using soft processors, we propose COMA, a cooperative management scheme in this paper for energy efficient implementation of real-time operating systems on soft processors. By utilizing the configurability of soft processors, we tightly couple several customized energy management hardware peripherals to them. These hardware peripherals cooperatively manage tasks and interrupts together with the processor while retaining the real-time responsiveness of the operating system. More specifically, they perform the following functionalities: (1) control the clock distribution network for driving the processor, the hardware peripherals and the communication interfaces between them; (2) take over the task and interrupt management responsibility of the operating system when the processor is shut off; (3) selectively wake up the processor and the corresponding hardware components for task execution based on the configurations of the processor and the hardware resource requirements of the tasks. We implement a real-time operating system on a popular soft processor to illustrate our approach. We show the development of an embedded application on the operating system enhanced with our energy management techniques. Actual measurements on an FPGA board demonstrates that our energy management scheme leads to energy reductions ranging from 73.3% to 89.9% and 86.8% on the average for the various execution scenarios considered in this paper.","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508534.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.26","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COMA: a cooperative management scheme for energy efficient implementation of real-time operating systems on FPGA based soft processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"COMA: a cooperative management scheme for energy efficient implementation of real-time operating systems on FPGA based soft processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508534/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508534/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733160","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COMA: a cooperative management scheme for energy efficient implementation of real-time operating systems on FPGA based soft processors","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061328S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1508536,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The general computing world settled on binary floating-point representations over three decades ago, and more recently, the FPGA community followed their example. Binary representations were chosen to maximize numerical accuracy per bit of data, however, the unique nature of FPGA-based computation makes numerical accuracy per unit of FPGA resources a more important measure of the usefulness of a given floating-point representation. In this paper, we show that higher radix floating-point representations are well suited to FPGA-based computations, especially high precision calculations which require the support of denormalized numbers. Higher radix representations use FPGA resources more efficiently. For example, a hexadecimal floating-point adder has a 30% smaller area-time product than its binary counterpart, while still delivering equal worst-case and better average-case numerical accuracy. Contrary to established belief, higher radix representations are useful for FPGA applications requiring IEEE 754 compliance, since they can deliver superior numerical performance while still using less FPGA resources.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.43","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508536.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher radix floating-point representations for FPGA-based arithmetic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508536/","displayDocTitle":"Higher radix floating-point representations for FPGA-based arithmetic","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508536/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","accessionNumber":"8733162","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher radix floating-point representations for FPGA-based arithmetic","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067305S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508537,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Modern FPGAs boast several GigaFLOPs of raw computing power. Unfortunately, this computing power is distributed across 30 floating-point units with over 10 cycles of latency each. The user must find two orders of magnitude more parallelism than is typically exploited in a single microprocessor; thus, it is not clear that the computational power of FPGAs can be exploited across a wide range of algorithms. This paper explores three implementation alternatives for the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on FPGAs. The algorithms are compared in terms of sustained performance and memory requirements for various FFT sizes and FPGA sizes.

In this work, we created a parameterized LNS library of computational units and compared them to an existing floating point library.

Unless network security systems use more advanced methods of content filtering such as deep packet inspection, the problem get worse. However, searching for patterns at multiple offsets in entire content of network packet requires more processing power than most general purpose processor can provide. Thus, researchers have developed high performance parallel deep packet filters for reconfigurable devices. Although some reconfigurable systems can be generated automatically from pattern database, obtaining high performance result from each subsequent reconfiguration can be a time consuming process. We present a novel architecture for programmable parallel pattern matching coprocessor. By combining a scalable coprocessor with the compact reconfigurable filter, we produce a hybrid system that is able to update the rules immediate during the time the new filter is being compiled. We mapped our hybrid filter for the latest Snort rule set on January 13, 2005, containing 2,044 unique patterns byte make up 32,384 bytes, onto a single Xilinx Virtex 4LX-XC4VLX15 FPGA with a filtering rate of 2 Gbps.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.34","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508541.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast reconfiguring deep packet filter for 1+ gigabit network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508541/","displayDocTitle":"Fast reconfiguring deep packet filter for 1+ gigabit network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508541/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast reconfiguring deep packet filter for 1+ gigabit network","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06025S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1508542,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Researchers have been working to implement components of intrusion detection systems (IDS), such as the highly popular Snort system, in reconfigurable hardware. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching and header processing, complete systems have not yet been demonstrated that effectively combine all of the functionality necessary to perform rule processing for network systems. In this paper, a framework for implementing a rule processing system in reconfigurable hardware is presented. The framework integrates the functionality to scan dataflows for regular expressions, fixed strings, and header values. It also allows modules to be added to perform extended functionality to support all features found in Snort rules. Reconfigurability and flexibility are key components of the framework that enable it to adapt to protect Internet systems from threats including malicious worms, computer viruses, and network intruders. To prove the framework viable, a system has been built that scans all bytes of transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) traffic entering and leaving a network's gateway at multi-gigabit rates. Using Xilinx FPGA hardware on the field programmable port extender (FPX) platform, the framework can process 32,768 complex rules at data rates of 2.5 Gbps. Systems to handle data at 10 Gbps rates can be built today using the same framework in the latest reconfigurable hardware devices such as the Virtex 4.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.7","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508542.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for rule processing in reconfigurable network systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508542/","displayDocTitle":"A framework for rule processing in reconfigurable network systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733168","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508542/","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for rule processing in reconfigurable network systems","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09893S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1508544,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.F.

Our approach supports two main features: deriving architectures that meet performance goals involving metrics such as resource usage and execution time, and inferring design behavior by generating behavioral code that is easy to verify and modify from scheduled designs such as pipeline architectures. We report four recent developments that significantly enhance the Haydn approach: (a) a design methodology that supports both cycle-accurate and behavioral levels, in which developers can move from one level to the other: (b) an extended scheduling algorithm which supports operation chaining, pipelined resources (with different latencies and initiation intervals), forwarding technique for loop-carried dependencies, and resource sharing and control; (c) a hardware design flow that can be customized with a script language and extended simulation capabilities for the RC2000 board; and (d) an evaluation of our approach using various case studies, including 3D free-form deformation (FFD), Gouraud shading, Fibonacci series, Montgomery multiplication, and one-dimensional DCT. For instance, our approach has been used to produce various FFD designs in hardware automatically; the smallest at 137 MHz is 294 times faster than software on a dual AMD MP2600+ processor machine at 2.1 GHz, and is 2.7 times smaller and 10% slower than the fastest design at 153 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.44","startPage":"245","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508544.pdf","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.44","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508544/","displayDocTitle":"Interleaving behavioral and cycle-accurate descriptions for reconfigurable hardware compilation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1508544/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8733170","publicationDate":"2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interleaving behavioral and cycle-accurate descriptions for reconfigurable hardware compilation","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508544.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069796S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1508545,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Although modern FPGAS allow the designer to modify dynamically even only portions of the chip, to this date there is a lack of satisfying design methodologies that using only non-proprietary widely available tools make it possible to optimally implement a high-level specification into a partially dynamically reconfigurable system. The aim of this work is to propose a methodology for solving this problem. The main features of the Caronte methodology are: 1. full exploitation of partial dynamic reconfiguration; 2. the reconfiguration is internal; 3. a real-time Unix-like operating system helps the management of complex systems with multiple tasks, and simplifies reconfiguration through an optimized device driver.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2005.25","publicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10083/32316/01508572.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2005.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caronte: a complete methodology for the implementation of partially dynamically self-reconfiguring systems on FPGA platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Caronte: a complete methodology for the implementation of partially dynamically self-reconfiguring systems on FPGA platforms","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508572/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733198","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 2005","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caronte: a complete methodology for the implementation of partially dynamically self-reconfiguring systems on FPGA platforms","confLoc":"Napa, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01508572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11577S","chronDate":"18-20 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10083","isNumber":"32316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10083","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32316","articleId":"1508572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1508573,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

Testing and analysis are performed at pressures that can be generated using reciprocating membrane micropumps integrated into a Micro Total Analysis System. It is determined that one of the proposed mixer concepts outperforms all of the other designs considered and enhanced mixing is achieved under pulsating flow. Performance is judged based on criteria that describes the amount of mixing performed, the concentration uniformity at the outlet of the mixer, and the net flow rate. Recommendations are made on how to improve the overall performance of the passive micromixers.","doi":"10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1508963","publicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on MEMS, NANO and Smart Systems (ICMENS'04)","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 International Conference on MEMS, NANO and Smart Systems (ICMENS'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10085/32318/01508963.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1508963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Passive Microfluidic Mixers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1508963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1508963/","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Passive Microfluidic Mixers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1508963/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Passive Microfluidic Mixers","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"01508963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041449S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10085","isNumber":"32318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10085","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32318","articleId":"1508963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1509004,"authors":[{"name":"P.D.

A simple transmission line model is presented to illustrate the impact of the switch off-state capacitance on the switch isolation and frequency range of operation. The figure of merit analysis given in this paper demonstrates that RF MEMS switches have superior insertion loss and isolation performance in comparison to MESFET and p-i-n diode switches. The paper also addresses several other design considerations beside insertion loss and isolation for selecting the right RF switch.

In organizations, speed, clarity, and effectiveness are essential for the transfer of knowledge. Today, mainly text is used. This paper illustrates how knowledge maps, a subset of knowledge visualization, help to transfer strategic knowledge in organizations. First, we introduce a framework that structures knowledge maps. Secondly, we describe with three complementary case studies how organizations profited from the various functions of knowledge maps. The findings are important for researchers in the fields of knowledge visualization, information visualization, knowledge management and for practitioners from different industries.","doi":"10.1109/IV.2005.27","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10086/32319/01509062.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2005.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Excel and Powerpoint: knowledge maps for the transfer and creation of knowledge in organizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Excel and Powerpoint: knowledge maps for the transfer and creation of knowledge in organizations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8624227","htmlLink":"/document/1509062/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Excel and Powerpoint: knowledge maps for the transfer and creation of knowledge in organizations","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"01509062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059757S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10086","isNumber":"32319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10086","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32319","articleId":"1509062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509100,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This is due to the modular construction style associated with asynchronous circuits, where each asynchronous module can be designed as a standalone object communicating with other modules. We propose a visualisation system for asynchronous circuit design tools, based on clustered graph visualisation and coordinated views. The novelty of our approach is to apply classical software visualisation techniques to a hardware environment and take advantage of properties specific to our asynchronous design flow. This system is based on a control and data flow graph representation of the asynchronous circuit compiled from a high-level description by a syntax-directed transparent process and transferable to the final hardware circuit by a direct synthesis process. Compared to software compilation flows, this transparent design flow offers opportunities for visualisation, with representations at different stages being easily mapped onto each other to combine their visualisation qualities. Each representation also exhibits properties based on some physical attributes of the final hardware circuit, allowing us to render some abstract properties on top of real-world-based ones. This paper shows how the handshake circuit graph is used as the underlying structure onto which properties extracted from other structures are mapped, and then how this structured graph is used as the central piece in a coordinated views environment. These visualisation techniques have been exercised by designers optimising the design of a fully asynchronous ARM processor.","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10086/32319/01509100.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"356","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","doi":"10.1109/IV.2005.119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2005.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software visualisation techniques adapted and extended for asynchronous hardware design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Hardware","Asynchronous circuits","Software design","Modular construction","Flow graphs","Circuit synthesis","Control system synthesis","Software quality","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program visualisation","integrated circuit design","asynchronous circuits","flow graphs","data flow graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software visualization","asynchronous hardware design","asynchronous circuit design","control flow graph representation","data flow graph representation","direct synthesis","handshake circuit graph","circuit design optimization","fully asynchronous ARM processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software visualisation","coordinated views","program comprehension","asynchronous circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Software visualisation techniques adapted and extended for asynchronous hardware design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8624264","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software visualisation techniques adapted and extended for asynchronous hardware design","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"01509100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06206S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10086","isNumber":"32319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10086","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32319","articleId":"1509100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1509103,"authors":[{"name":"S.-O.

Visualization tools may assist students in the easy and effective orientation of the status of their knowledge, as well as the access to knowledge elements and task-relevant knowledge resources. Most existing tools focus on the visualization of knowledge, arguments, or information only. It is claimed that concept mapping may function as a bridging technology. This paper analyses the potential of advanced digital concept mapping tools for visualizing knowledge, arguments, and information resources in an integrative and comprehensive manner. Structural, representational, processing and usability features of concept mapping are outlined. It is suggested that digital concept mapping may be used for effectively managing individual knowledge and knowledge resources in resource-based learning.","doi":"10.1109/IV.2005.44","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10086/32319/01509103.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2005.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital concept mapping in learning contexts: integrating knowledge, arguments and information resources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Digital concept mapping in learning contexts: integrating knowledge, arguments and information resources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8624267","htmlLink":"/document/1509103/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital concept mapping in learning contexts: integrating knowledge, arguments and information resources","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"01509103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049842S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10086","isNumber":"32319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10086","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32319","articleId":"1509103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509104,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Packages represent the coarse grained structure of an application. They are artefacts to deploy and structure software, and therefore more than a simple generalization of classes. The relationships between packages and their contained classes are key in the decomposition of an application and its (re)-modularisation. However, it is difficult to quickly grasp the structure of a package and to understand how a package interacts with the rest of the system. We tackle this problem using butterfly visualizations, i.e., dedicated radar charts built from simple package metrics based on a language-independent meta-model.

These data, together with the data stored in a versioning system, such as CVS, are a valuable source of information on which useful analyses can be performed. In this paper we propose a method to derive the set of source files impacted by a proposed change request.

Currently, most designs are accomplished through the use of HDL-centric flows. However, device densities have increased at a pace that such flows have become both cumbersome and outdated. The need for a more innovative and higher-level design flow that directly incorporates model simulation with hardware implementation is needed. Simulink is a well-known tool which allows designers to model a system at a high level and is ideal for certain classes of applications, such as automotive control. The complication of using such a tool for both modeling and hardware implementation is that there currently exists no tool chain to generate hardware from the basic Simulink blockset. This research aims to bridge that gap and provide students a way to perform high-level modeling and hardware implementation in a timely manner for design projects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8531562","htmlLink":"/document/1509377/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"12-13 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Simulink-to-FPGA implementation tool for enhanced design flow [educational applications]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulink-to-FPGA implementation tool for enhanced design flow [educational applications]","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01509377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039914S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10090","isNumber":"32323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10090","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"32323","articleId":"1509377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509384,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A library of required elements for implementing GALS circuits is proposed and general design considerations to successfully implement a GALS circuit on FPGA are discussed. The library includes clock generators and arbiters, and different port controllers. Different implementations of these circuits and their advantages and disadvantages are explored. At the end we present a GALS Reed-Solomon decoder as a practical example. The results show that the GALS approach improves the performance of the circuit by 11% and reduces the power consumption by 18.7% to 19,6% considering different error rates. On the other hand, the area of the circuit is increased by 51% which is acceptable considering that a pure synchronous circuit including a central controller is decomposed to generate GALS system and 29% of this overhead belongs to distributing controller in different modules. Deploying better decomposition methods can reduce this overhead substantially.","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2005.41","publicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10092/32325/01509434.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2005.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32325","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prototyping globally asynchronous locally synchronous circuits on commercial synchronous FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509434/","displayDocTitle":"Prototyping globally asynchronous locally synchronous circuits on commercial synchronous FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509434/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8598176","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototyping globally asynchronous locally synchronous circuits on commercial synchronous FPGAs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01509434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047169S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10092","isNumber":"32325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10092","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32325","articleId":"1509434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509437,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Current MPSoC are designed at register transfer level. The bus functional model is a higher level of abstraction that allows the integration of heterogeneous hardware, software components and sophisticated communication interconnects to adapt different description models. This system abstraction model makes it possible to accelerate the simulation but ignores the accuracy of the developed circuit. This paper studies an example of system design transformation from a high level of abstraction to the physical prototype of a multiprocessor system on chip. With this work we propose a systematic and efficient design flow for system on chip integration from a bus functional level of abstraction towards physical prototyping of embedded systems. The flow is applied to accelerate an MPSoC example design.","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2005.48","publicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10092/32325/01509455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2005.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32325","startPage":"218","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic design flow for fast hardware/software prototype generation from bus functional model for MPSoC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design flow for fast hardware/software prototype generation from bus functional model for MPSoC","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598190","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1509455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design flow for fast hardware/software prototype generation from bus functional model for MPSoC","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01509455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03422S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10092","isNumber":"32325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10092","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32325","articleId":"1509455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1509457,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Their design requires a correct translation of the high-level system definition into the final implementation at the RTL level. We propose a general systematic development and test methodology and apply it in the context of complex video codecs. The approach is based on a fixed set of communication primitives and uses a high-level functional C model as golden specification of the complete system throughout the design. A clear separation between I/O and computing allows the isolation of a single functional component. This module is developed individually and its functional correctness can be verified separately by extracting its input stimuli and expected output from the golden specification. The combination of RTL simulation and emulation on a prototyping platform enables exhaustive testing of the separate modules to assure functional correctness. In this way, the debug cycle during system integration is minimized.","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2005.17","publicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"16th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10092/32325/01509461.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2005.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication primitives driven hardware design and test methodology applied on complex video applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509461/","displayDocTitle":"Communication primitives driven hardware design and test methodology applied on complex video applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598195","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509461/","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication primitives driven hardware design and test methodology applied on complex video applications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01509461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058242S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10092","isNumber":"32325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10092","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32325","articleId":"1509461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1509653,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper investigates the performance of streaming MPEG-4 video over UMTS dedicated channels with varying channel conditions. In order to evaluate the performance, simulation models for UMTS and MPEG-4 were developed. Simulation results show that UMTS radio control link (RLC) protocol operating in the acknowledged mode outperforms the unacknowledged mode. The latter mode provides timely delivery but no error recovery. The acknowledged mode can deliver acceptable video quality for RLC block error rates up to 40% utilizing a pre-decoder buffer. We also discover that RLC block size can affect the video quality with a larger RLC block size attaining better quality. However, the optimum RLC block size is dependent on the encoded video frame size and the channel bit rate. Therefore, the RLC block size can be tuned to a proper value given the encoded video frame size and channel bit rate.","doi":"10.1109/WICON.2005.15","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Wireless Internet (WICON'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Wireless Internet (WICON'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10095/32328/01509653.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WICON.2005.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of MPEG-4 Video Streaming over UMTS/WCDMA Dedicated Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509653/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of MPEG-4 Video Streaming over UMTS/WCDMA Dedicated Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8651689","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509653/","conferenceDate":"10-15 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of MPEG-4 Video Streaming over UMTS/WCDMA Dedicated Channels","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"01509653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051433S","chronDate":"10-15 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10095","isNumber":"32328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10095","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"32328","articleId":"1509653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1509680,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An efficient field calculation formula represented as an explicit expression is derived by the strategies of projection and binomial expansion. An optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm is constructed by the suitable fitness function and the selection strategies. The simulation results of 256-element spherical-section phased array show the capability of controlling focus accurately and effectively with the combined method made up of the explicit expression method and the genetic optimization algorithm. The simulation results of single focus, multiple foci, on-axial focus, and off-axial focus further convince the feasibility of three-dimensional (3-D) focus steering with excellent acoustic performances. A single focus with the focus dimension of 1.25 mm /spl times/ 1.25 mm /spl times/ 7 mm and with the intensity of 6080 W/cm/sup 2/ is formed. The multiple-focus pattern can enlarge the treatment volume 22 times larger than that of single focus with a sonication. In addition, a comparison between the explicit expression approach and the point source approach testifies to the applicability of the explicit expression approach. The experiment and simulation results of 16-element array actually confirm the feasibility of the combined method.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1509786","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/32332/01509786.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1509786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focused beam control for ultrasound surgery with spherical-section phased array: sound field calculation and genetic optimization algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Ultrasonic imaging","Surgery","Applicators","Acoustic beams","Neoplasms","Biomedical engineering","Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","surgery","genetic algorithms","arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focused beam control","ultrasound surgery","spherical-section phased array","sound field calculation","genetic optimization","binomial expansion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Computer Simulation","Computer-Aided Design","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Humans","Models, Genetic","Scattering, Radiation","Surgery, Computer-Assisted","Surgery, Computer-Assisted","Therapy, Computer-Assisted","Ultrasonic Therapy","Ultrasonic Therapy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Focused beam control for ultrasound surgery with spherical-section phased array: sound field calculation and genetic optimization algorithm","volume":"52","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1509786/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8578415","pubMedId":"16245597","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focused beam control for ultrasound surgery with spherical-section phased array: sound field calculation and genetic optimization algorithm","sourcePdf":"1509786.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115657S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"32332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"32332","articleId":"1509786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1509789,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Shi","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/32332/1509789/1509789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Shi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in engineering physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

Simulations based on an artery model, including a lipid-filled plaque, demonstrate that effective bulk motion compensation can be achieved within a certain motion range using spatial interpolation. We also propose a practical imaging scheme to minimize mechanical strains caused by tissue deformation based on a linear least squares fitting strategy.

Owing to these features, they are very suitable to be used as the sources of microacoustic channels or waveguides in the near future. The focusing properties of FIDTs are dominated solely by their geometric shapes. Therefore, to obtain optimal performance, it is essential to analyze the FIDTs with a variety of geometric shapes. However, among the existing studies concerning the diffraction of FIDTs, a detailed analysis and design of FIDTs is still in paucity. In this paper, we adopted the exact angular spectrum of plane wave theory (ASoW) to calculate the amplitude fields of FIDTs on Y-Z lithium niobate (LiNbO/sub 3/) with the shape as a concentric circular arc and the concentric wave surface. Based on the calculation results, we discussed the variations of the amplitude fields induced by changing number of pairs, degree of arc, and geometric focal length. In addition, the focusing properties of FIDTs on the (100)-oriented GaAs substrate were also analyzed and discussed. We also summarized the guiderules for designing a FIDT via four important factors. It is worth noting that the results of this study provide an important basis for designing various FIDTs to fit the desired applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1509798/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8578426","pubMedId":"16245608","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of focused interdigital transducers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of focused interdigital transducers","sourcePdf":"1509798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046986S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"32332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"32332","articleId":"1509798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1509849,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital and Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"lastName":"Xin Wang","id":"37293611600"},{"name":"D.

Cellular automata are basic computational structures of interacting units which are capable of exposing self-organization and emergent behavior.

The solution consists of a distributed software environment for a parallel simulation, where server processes can encapsulate a hardware accelerator instead of a software simulation.

Using auxiliary input and output sequences and appropriate permutations it is shown that it is possible to compute a prime-length DHT using two cyclic convolutions having the same form and length that can be computed in parallel leading to improve throughput with a reduced hardware and I/O costs. The two computation structures can be mapped on the same linear systolic array using an appropriate hardware-sharing technique.

The proposed method is carried out by modeling each MOS transistor (MOST) by their small-signal nullor-based model. It is shown that by using this type of modeling, the signal path (SP) between the output-input nodes can be approached. In this way, MOST that are not included In the SP should be eliminated, allowing to see the separation of the bias MOST and those that are not it. Most important is behavioral model generation of each MOST which provides a reduced set of network equations and it is represented by an admittance matrix where the order is given by the number of nodes of the SP. Therefore, small-signal characteristics of analog circuits can be easily approached.

It is used in turbo code schemes, and has enabled them to reach 1dB from Shannon's theoretical limit.

A new scheme is presented for the computation of LLR/sup e/ values in MAP-based systems. Based on exploiting the convolutional code Trellis properties, this scheme saves from 27 to 52% of the required area in LLR/sup e/ calculations, with a small penalty in critical path and without any change in BER performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Convolutional codes","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Bit error rate","Microelectronics","Iterative algorithms","Viterbi algorithm","Code standards","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","maximum likelihood decoding","iterative decoding","turbo codes","convolutional codes","trellis codes","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["max-log-MAP LLR/sup e/","VLSI architecture","channel iterative decoding system","BCJR decoding algorithm","turbo code scheme","Shannon theoretical limit","BER performance","MAP-based system","convolutional code","Trellis property","critical path"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509928","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2005.1509928","startPage":"359","endPage":"362 Vol. 1","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems, 2005.

Incumbent with the new technology is the challenge of providing flexible, reconfigurable architectures capable of catering to the dynamics of the network, while providing cost-effective solutions for service providers. In this article we focus on IP-based radio access network architectures for next-generation mobile systems. We provide an insight into wireless mesh-based connectivity for the RAN network elements - using short high-bandwidth links to interconnect the network entities in a multihop mesh network for backhauling traffic to the core. A generic self-similar fractal topology, using optical wireless transmission technology, is described. We study the performance of the architecture and conclude that mesh-based architectures are well suited to provide highly scalable, dynamic radio access networks with carrier-class features at significantly low system costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8594599","htmlLink":"/document/1509950/","displayDocTitle":"An architecture for next-generation radio access networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An architecture for next-generation radio access networks","sourcePdf":"01509950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04367S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"32333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"32333","articleId":"1509950","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1509951,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In MIMO systems a multi-user diversity gain can be extracted by tracking the channel fluctuations between each user and the base station, and scheduling transmission for the \"best\" user. Based on this idea, several opportunistic scheduling schemes that attempt to improve global capacity or satisfy users with different QoS requirements have been proposed. Transmit beamforming procedures aimed at increasing the channel fluctuations have been proposed. The simultaneous exploitation of both spatial and multi-user diversity is not straightforward; however, it may be achieved by a refined selection of the \"best\" user. In addition, a multiple access gain can be obtained from a simple SDMA/TOMA system. Finally, several resource allocation schemes are discussed for this hybrid multiple access system.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2005.1509951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/32333/01509951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2005.1509951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32333","startPage":"43","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of scheduling algorithms in MIMO-based fourth-generation wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An overview of scheduling algorithms in MIMO-based fourth-generation wireless systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8594600","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1509951/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of scheduling algorithms in MIMO-based fourth-generation wireless systems","sourcePdf":"01509951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059994S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"32333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"32333","articleId":"1509951","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509966,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Unlike OFDM and MC-CDMA, TDCS has very little exposure in the current literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509966/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","accessionNumber":"8577212","volume":"43","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"TDCS, OFDM, and MC-CDMA: a brief tutorial","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TDCS, OFDM, and MC-CDMA: a brief tutorial","sourcePdf":"01509966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04837S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"32334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"32334","articleId":"1509966","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509967,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Jiang (uniquejt@yahoo.co.uk) received a Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.

This method utilizes the complement bits that are added to the original information bits, which can effectively reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals with random frame size N and the coding rate R /spl les/ (N - k)/N, where k is a positive integer and k /spl les/ N/2. The performance results obtained with CBC are given and compared with that of some well known schemes, such as simple block coding, modified simple block coding, simple odd parity code, and cyclic coding, for the same purpose. The results show that at the same coding rate 3/4, CBC can achieve almost the same performance as SBC and MSBC, but with lower complexity, and the same performance can be obtained with a higher coding rate using CBC. The PAPR reductions of CBC with coding rate (N - 1)/N are almost the same as with a coding rate less than (N - 1)/N, but almost the twice as these of SOPC when N /spl ges/ 16. Moreover, we can find that PAPR is the lowest for all block codes using CBC with coding rate 3/4. So modified CBC (MCBC) is also proposed and analyzed, combined with the subblock processing technique to make CBC effective for OFDM systems with large frame sizes. The flexibility in coding rate choice and low complexity make the proposed CBC more suitable for random frame size with high coding rate and can also provide error detection.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2005.1509967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/32334/01509967.pdf","startPage":"S17","endPage":"S22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2005.1509967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complement block coding for reduction in peak-to-average power ratio of OFDM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1509967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1509967/","displayDocTitle":"Complement block coding for reduction in peak-to-average power ratio of OFDM signals","volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8577213","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1509967/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complement block coding for reduction in peak-to-average power ratio of OFDM signals","sourcePdf":"01509967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058012S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"32334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"32334","articleId":"1509967","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1509968,"authors":[{"name":"I.F.
