An oscillator-to-oscillator code embeds K logical bosonic modes (in an arbitrary state) into N physical modes by means of a Gaussian N-mode unitary and N-K auxiliary one-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill-states. Here we ask if \u2013 in analogy to qubit error-correcting codes \u2013 there are families of oscillator-to-oscillator codes with the following threshold property: They allow to convert physical displacement noise with variance below some threshold value to logical noise with variance upper bounded by any (arbitrary) constant. We find that this is not the case if encoding unitaries involving a constant amount of squeezing and maximum likelihood error decoding are used. We show a general lower bound on the logical error probability which is only a function of the amount of squeezing and independent of the number of modes. As a consequence, any physically implementable family of oscillator-to-oscillator codes combined with maximum likelihood error decoding does not admit a threshold.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3126881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09610029.pdf","startPage":"1068","endPage":"1084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3126881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Oscillator-to-Oscillator Codes Do Not Have a Threshold","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9610029/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610029/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education through the Program Photonics Research Germany [Quantum Code Design and Architecture (QCDA)-QuantERA ERA-NET Cofund in Quantum Technologies (QuantERA)]","grantNumber":"13N14776"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"P2EZP2-188093"},{"fundingName":"DFG Cluster of Excellence 2111 (Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology)"},{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education through the Program Photonics Research Germany (QCDA-QuantERA)","grantNumber":"13N14776"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oscillator-to-Oscillator Codes Do Not Have a Threshold","sourcePdf":"tit-hanggli-3126881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117735S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9610029","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9610033,"authors":[{"name":"Thong-Nhat Tran","affiliation":["Hongik University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9610033/tran-3126844-small.gif","p":["Thong-Nhat Tran (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in mathematics-informatics and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Dalat University, Vietnam, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

An EQM tree is a shortest-path multicast tree with minimum end-to-end (E2E) cost (a combination of queuing size ratio and link stability) subject to QoS constraints such as queuing size ratio, link stability, number of hops, number of time slots and avoiding the licensed channel of primary users. Particularly, we propose an NP-complete optimization problem such that its feasible solution is an EQM tree. To address this problem, we design a new DQN model and a new game-based model to form EQM trees in real-time by offline training instead of online training as done in previous papers. Moreover, the DQMR protocol is also guaranteed to have high stability, low routing delay, low control overhead, and high packet delivery ratio (PDR). Furthermore, one more new contribution of the paper is that exact closed-form expressions for the E2E queuing delay of a multicast routing tree are also derived assuming random waypoint mobility and the reference point group mobility models to compare with simulation results of routing delay. Simulation results show that the DQMR protocol outperforms multicast ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol in terms of routing delay, control overhead, and PDR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9610033/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Deep Q-Network Design for QoS Multicast Routing in Cognitive Radio MANETs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2019R1A2C1083996"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","grantNumber":"110-2222-E-224-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A New Deep Q-Network Design for QoS Multicast Routing in Cognitive Radio MANETs","sourcePdf":"access-an-3126844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125946S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9610033","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9610045,"authors":[{"name":"Song Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9610045/wang-3126834-small.gif","p":["Song Wang (Member, IEEE) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Shanghai University, China, in 2007, and the master\u2019s degree in telecommunication engineering from RMIT University, Australia, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering.

To protect networks against malicious access is always challenging even though it has been studied for a long time. Due to the evolution of network in both new technologies and fast growth of connected devices, network attacks are getting versatile as well. Comparing to the traditional detection approaches, machine learning is a novel and flexible method to detect intrusions in the network, it is applicable to any network structure. In this paper, we introduce the challenges of anomaly detection in the traditional network, as well as in the next generation network, and review the implementation of machine learning in the anomaly detection under different network contexts. The procedure of each machine learning category is explained, as well as the methodologies and advantages are presented.

In addition to the complexity and cost (computing and storage), the software-based detection methods mainly rely on the static signature analysis of the running programs, requiring continuous software update which is not affordable for embedded systems and edge devices with limited computing and communication bandwidth. To address these challenges, this work proposes an accurate and cost-efficient micro AI enabled countermeasure for securing modern edge devices against emerging cyber-attacks, i.e., malware and Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) at the hardware level by monitoring applications\u2019 Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) features. To realize a run-time ML-based solution that relies on limited available HPCs in modern edge processors, we first identify the most prominent HPC events for accurate attack detection with the aid of an effective feature selection method. Next, various standard machine learning classifiers are implemented for effective and accurate run-time hardware-assisted malware and side-channel attacks detection. They are compared and characterized in terms of detection accuracy, F-measure, robustness, latency, power consumption, and hardware overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the J48 classifier achieves the highest detection rate (F-measure) for both malware and SCAs detection with 0.917 and 0.987, respectively, with relatively negligible latency and area overhead as compared to complex models making it a suitable algorithm for enabling an efficient hardware-assisted micro AI countermeasure in edge devices.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3126816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09610047.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3126816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Micro AI for Securing Edge Devices at Hardware Level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610047/","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Micro AI for Securing Edge Devices at Hardware Level","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9610047/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF Program","grantNumber":"1936836"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Micro AI for Securing Edge Devices at Hardware Level","sourcePdf":"jetcas-wang-3126816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090511S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9610047","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9610051,"authors":[{"name":"Neri Merhav","affiliation":["Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Neri Merhav (Fellow, IEEE) was born in Haifa, Israel, in March 1957.

In this expository work, we investigate the role of the uniformity of the random binning distribution from the perspective of the trade-off between the reliability (defined in terms of the error exponent) and the compression performance (measured from the viewpoint of the source coding exponent). To this end, we study a much wider class of random\u2013binning distributions, which includes the ensemble of VRSW codes as a special case, but it also goes considerably beyond. We first show that, with the exception of some pathological cases, the smaller ensemble, of VRSW codes, is as good as the larger ensemble in terms the trade-off between the error exponent and the source coding exponent. Notwithstanding this finding, the wider class of ensembles proposed is motivated in two ways. The first is that it outperforms VRSW codes in the above\u2013mentioned pathological cases, and the second is that it allows robustness: in the event of a system failure that causes unavailability of the compressed bit\u2013stream from one of the sources, it still allows reconstruction of the other source within some controllable distortion.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3126980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3126980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","startPage":"737","endPage":"751","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09610051.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610051","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Source coding","Encoding","Decoding","Pathology","Entropy","Shape"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Slepian\u2013Wolf coding","random binning","universal decoding","error exponent","source coding exponent","variable\u2013rate coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On More General Distributions of Random Binning for Slepian\u2013Wolf Encoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9610051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610051/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On More General Distributions of Random Binning for Slepian\u2013Wolf Encoding","sourcePdf":"tit-merhav-3126980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061492S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9610051","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9610062,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan-Yin Lin","affiliation":["Simula UiB, Bergen, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Hsuan-Yin Lin (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from the National Tsing-Hua University (NTHU), Taiwan, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

While existing protocols strictly impose that no information is leaked on the file\u2019s identity, this work initiates the study of the tradeoffs that can be achieved by relaxing the perfect privacy requirement. We refer to such protocols as weakly-private information retrieval (WPIR) protocols. In particular, for the case of multiple noncolluding replicated servers, we study how the download rate, the upload cost, and the access complexity can be improved when relaxing the perfect privacy constraint. To quantify the information leakage on the requested file\u2019s identity we consider mutual information (MI), worst-case information leakage, and maximal leakage (MaxL). We present two WPIR schemes, denoted by Scheme A and Scheme B, based on two recent PIR protocols and show that the download rate of the former can be optimized by solving a convex optimization problem. We also show that Scheme A achieves an improved download rate compared to the recently proposed scheme by Samy \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</i>\n under the so-called \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-privacy metric. Additionally, a family of schemes based on partitioning is presented. Moreover, we provide an information-theoretic converse bound for the maximum possible download rate for the MI and MaxL privacy metrics under a practical restriction on the alphabet size of queries and answers. For two servers and two files, the bound is tight under the MaxL metric, which settles the WPIR capacity in this particular case. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed schemes and their gap to the converse bound.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3126865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09610062.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3126865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Server Weakly-Private Information Retrieval","volume":"68","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9610062/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610062/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"2016-04253"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1817/18"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018707","fundingName":"Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100016296","fundingName":"Israel National Cyber Directorate"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Server Weakly-Private Information Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tit-lin-3126865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177503S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9610062","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9610069,"authors":[{"name":"Xusheng Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xusheng","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0001-8463-0373"},{"name":"Lei Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0002-2293-0626"},{"name":"Kyeong Jin Kim","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyeong Jin","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-1943-8307"},{"name":"Qingqing Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qingqing","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Jiliang","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-3750-6841"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9610069","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Modulation","Uplink","Bit error rate","Scattering","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface","spatial scattering modulation","maximum likelihood detection","bit error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610069","abstract":"Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and spatial scattering modulation (SSM) are promising candidates for future generations of wireless communication.

Specifically, we design the reflecting phase shifters at the RIS to support the two-hop communications. Moreover, a maximum likelihood detector is adopted to a new system with RIS-SSM and a new analytical expression for a tight union upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) is derived. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the derived analytical expression.

Such a learning model is able to assess health states in real time provided that both training and testing samples are complete and have the same probability distribution. However, it is rare and difficult in practical applications to meet these requirements due to the continuous change in working conditions. Besides, conventional hyperparameters tuning via grid search or manual tuning requires a lot of human intervention and becomes inflexible for users. Two objectives are targeted in this work. In an attempt to remedy the data distribution mismatch issue, we firstly introduce a feature extraction and selection approach built upon correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction. Secondly, to diminish human intervention burdens, we propose an Automatic artificial Neural network with an Augmented Hidden Layer (Auto-NAHL) for the classification of health states. Within the designed network, it is worthy to mention that the novelty of the implemented neural architecture is attributed to the new multiple feature mappings of the inputs, where such configuration allows the hidden layer to learn multiple representations from several random linear mappings and produce a single final efficient representation. Hyperparameters tuning including the network architecture, is fully automated by incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The designed learning process is evaluated on a complex industrial plant as well as various classification problems. Based on the obtained results, it can be claimed that our proposal yields better response to new hidden representations by obtaining a higher approximation compared to some previous works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9610082/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Auto-NAHL: A Neural Network Approach for Condition-Based Maintenance of Complex Industrial Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Library"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Auto-NAHL: A Neural Network Approach for Condition-Based Maintenance of Complex Industrial Systems","sourcePdf":"access-muyeen-3127084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087588S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9610082","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9610107,"authors":[{"name":"Yirong Yang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9610107/yang-3127006-small.gif","p":["Yirong Yang received the B.S. degree in automation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China, in 2019.

In this paper, we investigate the detection problem of ultra high-order quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) FTN signaling where we exploit a mathematical programming technique based on the alternating directions multiplier method (ADMM). The proposed ADMM sequence estimation (ADMMSE) FTN signaling detector demonstrates an excellent trade-off between performance and computational effort enabling successful detection and SE gains for QAM modulation orders as high as 64K (65,536). The complexity of the proposed ADMMSE detector is polynomial in the length of the transmit symbols sequence and its sensitivity to the modulation order increases only logarithmically. Simulation results show that for 16-QAM, the proposed ADMMSE FTN signaling detector achieves comparable SE gains to the generalized approach semidefinite relaxation-based sequence estimation (GASDRSE) FTN signaling detector, but at an experimentally evaluated much lower computational time. Simulation results additionally show SE gains for modulation orders starting from 4-QAM, or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), up to and including 64K-QAM when compared to conventional Nyquist signaling. The very low computational effort required makes the proposed ADMMSE detector a practically promising FTN signaling detector for both low order and ultra high-order QAM FTN signaling systems.","doi":"10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3126805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3126805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9309127","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782661/9309127/09610117.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Modulation","Complexity theory","Estimation","Phase shift keying","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ADMM","faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling","intersymbol interference (ISI)","sequence estimation","ultra high-order QAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Low Complexity Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) Signaling Detector for Ultra High-Order QAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610117/","volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/9610117/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Corporate University Donations Program of the Nokia-Bell Labs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Low Complexity Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) Signaling Detector for Ultra High-Order QAM","sourcePdf":"ojcoms-ibrahim-3126805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218168S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782661","isNumber":"9309127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782661","xplore-issue":"9309127","articleId":"9610117","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9610134,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Chun Su","affiliation":["National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9610134/su-3126877-small.gif","p":["Mu-Chun Su (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 1986, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 1990 and 1993, respectively.

We present a video analytic system capable of monitoring in-class student\u2019s learning behaviors and providing feedback to the instructor. It is a common practice nowadays for students to take electronic notes or browse online using laptops and cellphones in class. However the use of technology can also impact student concentration and affect learning behaviors, which can seriously hinder their learning progress if not controlled properly. In this pioneering study, we propose a non-intrusive deep-learning based computer vision system to monitor student concentration by extracting and inferring high-level visual behavior cues, including their facial expressions, gestures and activities. Our system can automatically assist instructors with situational awareness in real time. We assume only RGB color images as input and runable system on edge devices for easy deployment. We propose two video analytic components for student behavior analysis: (1) The facial analysis component operates based on Dlib face detection and facial landmark tracking to localize each student and analyze their face orientations, eye blinking, gazes, and facial expressions. (2) The activity detection and recognition component operates based on OpenPose and COCO object detection can identify eight types of in-class gestures and behaviors including raising-hand, typing, phone-answering, crooked-head, desk napping, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">etc.</i>\n Experiments are performed on a newly collected real-world In-Class Student Activity Dataset (ICSAD), where we achieved nearly 80% activity detection rate.

Thirty-seven years after he predicted its existence, in the May 1 (2008) issue of the journal \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Nature</i>\n, a team at HP Labs led by the scientist R. S. Williams proved that the memristor was real by formulating a physics-based model of a memristor and build nanoscale devices in their lab that demonstrate all of the necessary operating characteristics. Since then, the extensive interest of academic and industrial circles on neuromorphic computing based on memristor has been skyrocketed. Moreover, the unusual electrical properties of circuits and systems based on memristor can mimic the functionalities of the human brain, and can provide an in-depth understanding of key design implications of memristor-based memories, such as learning and anticipating. As a result, neuromorphic computing based on memristor is expected to bring significant breakthrough in dynamic neuromorphic memories, memristor-based resistive RAM, non-volatile memory technology, and so on.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"68","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9610165/","displayDocTitle":"Editorial Special Issue for 50th Birthday of Memristor Theory and Application of Neuromorphic Computing Based on Memristor\u2014Part I","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Editorial Special Issue for 50th Birthday of Memristor Theory and Application of Neuromorphic Computing Based on Memristor\u2014Part I","sourcePdf":"tcsi-huang-3115842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035091S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9610147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9610147","articleId":"9610165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":9610176,"authors":[{"name":"Bingting Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, and the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Bingting","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-2342-3060"},{"name":"Zhuo Tang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, and the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0001-9081-8153"},{"name":"Xiong Xiao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, and the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Jing Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yao"},{"name":"Ronghui Cao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, and the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ronghui","lastName":"Cao","orcid":"0000-0001-5026-0001"},{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, and the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-2635-7716"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9610176","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Containers","Computer architecture","Tools","Servers","Clustering algorithms","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-scale computing","supercomputing system","distributed containerized deployment","registries placement","OpenStack"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Automated Deployment Architecture for OpenStack in TianHe SuperComputing Environment","abstract":"Recently, with the large-scale outbreak of the global financial crisis and public safety incidents (such as COVID-19), high-performance computing has been widely applied to risk prediction, vaccine development, and other fields. In scenarios where high-performance computing infrastructure responds to the instantaneous explosion of computing demands, a crucial issue is to provide large-scale flexible allocation and adjustment of computing capability by rapidly constructing computing clusters. Existing large-scale computing cluster deployment solutions usually utilize source code deployment or other deployment tools. The great challenge of existing deployment methods is to reduce excessive image distribution time and refrain from configuration defects. In this article, we design an intelligent distributed registry deployment (IDRD) architecture based on the OpenStack cloud platform, which adaptively places distributed image repositories using the containerized deployment of multiple registries. We propose a server load priority algorithm to solve multiple registries placement problems in IDRD. Furthermore, we devise a clustering algorithm based on demand density that can optimize the global performance of IDRD and improve large-scale cluster load balancing capabilities, which has been implemented in the TianHe Supercomputing environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IDRD can effectively reduce \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$30\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$50\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n of the distribution time of component images and significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale cluster deployment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3127128","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3127128","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1824","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09610176.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610176/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Automated Deployment Architecture for OpenStack in TianHe SuperComputing Environment","volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1701400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"92055213, 61873090, L1924056 and 62002114"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province research and development plan project","grantNumber":"2020B0101100001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012455","fundingName":"China Knowledge Centre for Engineering Sciences and Technology","grantNumber":"CKCEST-2021-2-7"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Automated Deployment Architecture for OpenStack in TianHe SuperComputing Environment","sourcePdf":"tpds-tang-3127128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043296S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"9610176","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9610618,"authors":[{"name":"Sae Kyu Lee","affiliation":["IBM T.

Presenting an FPGA based hardware, switching of the walking patterns is confirmed experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA49188.2021.9610809","pdfPath":"/iel7/9610741/9610743/09610809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their Applications (CNNA)","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their Applications (CNNA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA49188.2021.9610809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9610743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Three-Layer Dynamic Binary Neural Networks for Control of Hexapod Walking Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2021-Oct. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Three-Layer Dynamic Binary Neural Networks for Control of Hexapod Walking Robots","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2021","publicationDate":"29 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9610809/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Three-Layer Dynamic Binary Neural Networks for Control of Hexapod Walking Robots","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"CNNA_2020_paper_5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038908S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2021-Oct. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9610741","isNumber":"9610743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9610741","xplore-issue":"9610743","articleId":"9610809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9610988,"authors":[{"name":"Shimaa Naser","affiliation":["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Shimaa","lastName":"Naser","orcid":"0000-0002-2941-9337"},{"name":"Lina Bariah","affiliation":["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Bariah","orcid":"0000-0001-7244-1663"},{"name":"Sami Muhaidat","affiliation":["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE","Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Muhaidat","orcid":"0000-0003-4649-9399"},{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Qutayri","affiliation":["Systems-on-Chip Center, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Qutayri","orcid":"0000-0002-9600-8036"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","orcid":"0000-0001-5945-0813"},{"name":"Paschalis C.

In this context, the present work considers the integration of two distinct modulation schemes, namely spatial modulation (SM) with space time block codes (STBCs), aiming at improving the overall VLC system reliability. Based on this and in order to further enhance the achievable transmission data rate, we integrate quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) with SM, since relaxing the orthogonality condition of OSTBC ultimately provides a higher coding rate. Then, we generalize the developed results to any number of active light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and any \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-ary pulse amplitude modulation size. Furthermore, we derive a tight and tractable upper bound for the corresponding bit error rate (BER) by considering a simple two-step decoding procedure to detect the indices of the transmitting LEDs and then decode the signal domain symbols. Notably, the obtained results demonstrate that QOSTBC with SM enhances the achievable BER compared to SM with repetition coding (RC-SM). Finally, we compare STBC-SM with both multiple active SM (MASM) and RC-SM in terms of the achievable BER and overall data rate, which further justifies the usefulness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3126873","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3126873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9614351","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/9614351/09610988.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Block Coded Spatial Modulation for Indoor Visible Light Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610988/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Block Coded Spatial Modulation for Indoor Visible Light Communications","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9610988/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7303111","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004070","fundingName":"Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research","grantNumber":"KU/FSU-8474000122 and KU/RC1-C2PS-T2/8474000137"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Space-Time Block Coded Spatial Modulation for Indoor Visible Light Communications","sourcePdf":"jphot-sofotasios-3126873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107066S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"9614351","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","xplore-issue":"9614351","articleId":"9610988","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9610991,"authors":[{"name":"Nils L.

This can result in a reduced satisfaction and increased listening effort of the listeners. Since the broadcast sound is usually premixed, we perform a subjective evaluation for quantifying the potential of speech enhancement systems based on audio source separation and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Recently, RNNs have shown promising resultsin the context of sound source separation and real-time signal processing. In this paper, we separate the speech from the background signals and remix the separated sounds at a higher signal-to-noise ratio. This differs from classic speech enhancement, where usually only the extracted speech signal is exploited. The subjective evaluation with 20 normal-hearing subjects on real TV-broadcast material shows that our proposed enhancement system is able to reduce the listening effort by around 2 points on a 13-point listening effort rating scale and increases the perceived sound quality compared to the original mixture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Source separation","Time-frequency analysis","TV","Time-domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","listening effort","deep learning","real-time source separation","LSTM","broadcast signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2021.3126931","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/9289074/09610991.pdf","startPage":"3541","endPage":"3550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9289074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2021.3126931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Subjective Listening Effort for TV Broadcast Signals With Recurrent Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Subjective Listening Effort for TV Broadcast Signals With Recurrent Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610991/","volume":"29","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9610991/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research","grantNumber":"01/S17017B"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"},{"fundingName":"Germany\u2019s Excellence Strategy \u2013 EXC","grantNumber":"2177/1 and 390895286"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Subjective Listening Effort for TV Broadcast Signals With Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-westhausen-3126931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093984S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"9289074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","xplore-issue":"9289074","articleId":"9610991","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9610992,"authors":[{"name":"Qingqing Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9610992/wu-3121790-small.gif","p":["Qingqing Wu (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, in 2016.","From 2016 to 2020, he was a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Most existing works on IRS have focused on exploiting IRS to enhance the performance of wireless communication or wireless information transmission (WIT), while its potential for boosting the efficiency of radio frequency (RF) wireless energy transmission (WET) still remains largely open. Although IRS-aided WET shares similar characteristics with IRS-aided WIT, they differ fundamentally in terms of design objective, receiver architecture, practical constraints, and so on. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview on how to efficiently design IRS-aided WET systems as well as IRS-aided systems with both WIT and WET, namely, IRS-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and IRS-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN), from a communication and signal processing perspective. In particular, we present state-of-the-art solutions to tackle the unique challenges in operating these systems, such as IRS passive reflection optimization, channel estimation, and deployment. In addition, we propose new solution approaches and point out important directions for future research and investigation.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2021.3121790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3121790","startPage":"150","endPage":"170","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/9675003/09610992.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Wireless Energy and Information Transmission: An Overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Wireless Energy and Information Transmission: An Overview","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"110","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9610992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610992/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Macau Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR","grantNumber":"0119/2020/A3, SKL-IOTSC-2021-2023 and 0108/2020/A"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong NSF","grantNumber":"2021A1515011900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62171461"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Province Basic Research Project","grantNumber":"BK20212001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Singapore","grantNumber":"T2EP50120-0024"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"Advanced Research and Technology Innovation Centre (ARTIC), National University of Singapore","grantNumber":"R-261-518-005-720"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Wireless Energy and Information Transmission: An Overview","sourcePdf":"jproc-guan-3121790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145299S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"9675003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9675003","articleId":"9610992","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9610994,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Al-Saffar","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Al-Saffar","orcid":"0000-0002-8655-2396","id":"37087388235"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0003-4340-5801","id":"37085505409"},{"name":"Amin Abbosh","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Abbosh","orcid":"0000-0002-8015-5883","id":"37297192800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2333-9403"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-0118"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2573-0436"}],"articleNumber":"9610994","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9610994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Image coding","Scattering parameters","Dielectrics","Training","Data models","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave imaging","tomography","inverse scattering problem","deep learning","brain imaging","electromagnetic imaging"]}],"abstract":"Electromagnetic medical imaging in the microwave regime is a hard problem notorious for 1) instability 2) under-determinism. This two-pronged problem is tackled with a two-pronged solution that uses double compression to maximally utilizing the cheap unlabelled data to a) provide a priori information required to ease under-determinism and b) reduce sensitivity of inference to the input. The result is a stable solver with a high resolution output. This work introduces a model named \u2018DeepHead\u2019; a fully data-driven implementation of the paradigm proposed in the context of microwave brain imaging. It infers the dielectric distribution of the brain at a desired single frequency while making use of an input that spreads over a wide band of frequencies. The performance of the model is evaluated with both simulations and human volunteers experiments. The inference made is juxtaposed with ground-truth dielectric distribution in simulation case, and the golden MRI / CT imaging modalities of the volunteers in real-world case.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9318600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2021.3126928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/9318600/09610994.pdf","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1288","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2021.3126928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tripartite Data-Driven Approach for Wide-Band Electromagnetic Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Tripartite Data-Driven Approach for Wide-Band Electromagnetic Imaging","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9610994/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9610994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"Department of Industry Science and Innovation","grantNumber":"CRC-P-516"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tripartite Data-Driven Approach for Wide-Band Electromagnetic Imaging","sourcePdf":"tci-alsaffar-3126928-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085886S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"9318600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","xplore-issue":"9318600","articleId":"9610994","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9611010,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Weisman","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/9289074/9611010/weism-3126946-small.gif","p":["Ran Weisman (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc.

This concept has been investigated for speech enhancement applications, improving noise reduction and late reverberation attenuation. Current studies typically assume that the parameters of the early reflections, such as the direction-of-arrival, delay and amplitude, are known in advance in the rake filter design. This work presents a novel investigation of the acoustic rake filter in a more practical context, focusing on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) formulation. First, the sensitivity of the filter performance to perturbations in the reflection parameters is derived analytically, and investigated numerically using Monte Carlo simulations with a spherical microphone array. Then, an end-to-end example of rake filtering in a blind scenario is presented, where the reflection parameters are estimated from speech signals without any prior information. This example demonstrates for the first time the use of rake filtering in a realistic scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611010/","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/9611010/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of Acoustic Rake Filters in Minimum Variance Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Facebook Reality Labs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robustness of Acoustic Rake Filters in Minimum Variance Beamforming","sourcePdf":"taslp-weisman-3126946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121792S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"9289074","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","xplore-issue":"9289074","articleId":"9611010","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9611019,"authors":[{"name":"Mingchuan Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9642402/9611019/wu-3127138-small.gif","p":["Mingchuan Wu is currently working toward the PhD degree in the State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

To accurate age estimation from facial images requires a large amount of image data in the training period. The face outlook and the neck changes with age. Thinning skin and increase or loss of muscle tone give the face a different appearance. For that, all existing methods require a large amount of face-aging subjects. This paper proposed an age estimation using shortcut identity connection of ResNet50 architecture. The proposed architecture is 50 layers of Residual Network (ResNet50) based on CNN. The proposed algorithm can solve a few face-aging subject's problems using the shortcut identity connection of residual blocks. The proposed algorithm has used the ImageNet database as the primary face aging database of the proposed gateway. The experimental results of the proposed model are close to the experimental results of other models. The experimental results have shown that using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) containing ImageNet facial images information with 35 layers of residual network with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.38.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Databases","Surveillance","Neural networks","Estimation","Skin","Neck"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Age estimation","Residual Network","Shortcut Identity Connection","Residual Block","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEEI52609.2021.9611146","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611036/9611097/09611146.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEI52609.2021.9611146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age Estimation Using Shortcut Identity Connection of ResNet50 Based on Convolutional Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Age Estimation Using Shortcut Identity Connection of ResNet50 Based on Convolutional Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611146/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"12 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611146/","conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age Estimation Using Shortcut Identity Connection of ResNet50 Based on Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068084S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611036","isNumber":"9611097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611036","xplore-issue":"9611097","articleId":"9611146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":9611209,"authors":[{"name":"Mojan Javaheripi","affiliation":["UC San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9611209/javah-3127433-small.gif","p":["Mojan Javaheripi (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology in 2017.

This paper proposes AutoRank, an end-to-end framework for customizing neural network decomposition using cross-layer rank-selection. For many-layer networks, determining the optimal decomposition ranks is a cumbersome task. To overcome this challenge, we establish a state-action-reward system that effectively absorbs inference accuracy and platform specifications into the rank-selection policy. Our proposed framework brings platform characteristics and performance in the customization loop to enable direct incorporation of hardware cost, e.g., runtime and memory footprint. By means of this hardware-awareness, AutoRank customization engine delivers high accuracy decomposed deep neural networks with low execution cost. Our framework minimizes the engineering cost associated with rank selection by providing an automated API for AutoRank that is compatible with popular deep learning libraries and can be readily used by developers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"AutoRank: Automated Rank Selection for Effective Neural Network Customization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"2016737"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)","grantNumber":"2899.001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011039","fundingName":"Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)","grantNumber":"2018-18022100004"},{"fundingName":"Intel Private AI Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AutoRank: Automated Rank Selection for Effective Neural Network Customization","sourcePdf":"jetcas-samraghrazlighi-3127433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100453S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9611209","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9611224,"authors":[{"name":"Beomseok Kang","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9611224/kang-3127129-small.gif","p":["Beomseok Kang received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2020.

Employing matrix measure method and two Halanay-type inequalities, some succinct stabilization criteria in terms of algebraic inequalities are derived for the INN with time-varying delays under periodically intermittent control (PIMC) strategy. Moreover, more precise results are obtained to stabilize the INN with time-invariant delays by using comparison principle. Specifically, the criteria of matrix measure form proposed in this paper can be converted into LMI-type condition for the case of 2-norm, which provides a bridge between the matrix-measure method and the Lyapunov function method. Finally, two numerical examples validate the efficacy of the derived results. The comparative research shows that the proposed methods generalize and develop some known results.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127147","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09611267.pdf","startPage":"152574","endPage":"152584","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix Measure Strategies for Stabilization of Delayed Inertial Neural Networks via Intermittent Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Matrix Measure Strategies for Stabilization of Delayed Inertial Neural Networks via Intermittent Control","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61873219"},{"fundingName":"Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Foundation","grantNumber":"ZK[2021]302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003458","fundingName":"Doctoral Research Project Foundation of Guizhou Normal University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Matrix Measure Strategies for Stabilization of Delayed Inertial Neural Networks via Intermittent Control","sourcePdf":"access-chen-3127147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09391S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9611267","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9611281,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Shun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1641-0771"},{"name":"Jianpeng Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jianpeng","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0002-4452-8881"},{"name":"Octavia A.

In this letter, we consider the acquisition of the time-varying cascaded channels, which is a challenging task due to the massive number of passive RIS elements and the small channel coherence time. To reduce the pilot overhead, a deep learning-based channel extrapolation is implemented over both antenna and time domains. We divide the neural network into two parts, i.e., the time-domain and the antenna-domain extrapolation networks, where the neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) are utilized.

In the latter, ODE is resorted to modify the relations among different data layers in a feedforward neural network. We cascade the two networks and jointly train them.

The VGA consists of a four-stage Cherry-Hooper amplifier, which is based on a feedback resistor and negative Miller capacitance to obtain wide bandwidth without inductors in the main circuit. A unique method for this structure to generate pseudo-exponential function is analyzed in detail. Therefore, an accurate dB-linear characteristic is realized in this VGA without any exponential generator circuits. The linear control voltage is applied directly to the gate of the transistor and this simple control method exhibits good robustness to process and temperature variation. Measurement results show that the voltage gain varies from \u221228 dB to 27 dB continuously with more than 4.3 GHz bandwidth and a dB-linear range of 32 dB with less than \u00b10.6 dB gain error. Without the output buffer, it consumes 8.5 mW from a 1.2V supply and occupies a small die area of only 0.04 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Wideband","Topology","Voltage control","Tuning","Resistors","Transistors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-controlled","cell-based","Cherry-Hooper","dB-linear","inductorless","low-power","pseudo-exponential","variable gain amplifier (VGA)","wideband"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09611290.pdf","startPage":"152646","endPage":"152656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Wideband dB-Linear Variable Gain Amplifier With Continuous Gain Adjusting in 90-nm CMOS Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Wideband dB-Linear Variable Gain Amplifier With Continuous Gain Adjusting in 90-nm CMOS Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611290/","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611290/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801027 and 62101038"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M631356"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B14010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"Z191100001119078"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design of a Wideband dB-Linear Variable Gain Amplifier With Continuous Gain Adjusting in 90-nm CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"access-fan-3127356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104193S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9611290","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9611319,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Ching-Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088434474"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Duke University, Durham, NC"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1695-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1696-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2250"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1089-3539"}],"articleNumber":"9611319","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611319","abstract":"Deep learning (DL) applications are becoming in- creasingly ubiquitous. However, recent research has highlighted a number of reliability concerns associated with deep neural networks (DNNs) used for DL. In particular, hardware-level reliability of DNNs is of concern when DL models are mapped to specialized neuromorphic hardware such as memristor-based crossbars. Faults in the crossbars can deviate the corresponding DNN model weights from their trained values. It is therefore desirable to have an on-device \"checksum\" function to indicate if model weights are deviated. We present a backdooring technique that fine-tunes DNN weights to implement the checksum function. The backdoored checksum function is triggered only when inferencing is carried out using a special set of data points with watermarks. We show that backdooring, i.e., fine-tuning of DNN weights, has no impact on the inferencing accuracy of the original DNN model. Moreover, the implemented checksum functions for AlexNet and VGG-16 remarkably outperform baseline approaches. Based on the proposed on-line functional testing solution, we present a computing framework that can efficiently recover the inferencing accuracy of a memristor-mapped DNN from weight deviations. Compared to related recent work, the proposed framework achieves 5.6 \u00d7 speed-up in time-to-recovery and reduces the on-chip test data volume by 99.99%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Degradation","Neuromorphics","Memristors","Watermarking","Hardware"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITC50571.2021.00016","startPage":"83","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611037/9611298/09611319.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ITC50571.2021.00016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line Functional Testing of Memristor-mapped Deep Neural Networks using Backdoored Checksums","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On-line Functional Testing of Memristor-mapped Deep Neural Networks using Backdoored Checksums","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611319/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line Functional Testing of Memristor-mapped Deep Neural Networks using Backdoored Checksums","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"169500a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08953S","chronDate":"10-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611037","isNumber":"9611298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611037","xplore-issue":"9611298","articleId":"9611319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9611404,"authors":[{"name":"Haochuan Song","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haochuan","lastName":"Song","id":"37086152090"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohu","lastName":"You","id":"37276505600"},{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"},{"name":"Christoph Studer","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Studer","id":"38575411500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0312-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3137-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611404","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum a posteriori estimation","Wireless communication","Equalizers","Simulation","Channel estimation","Modulation","Approximation algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611404","abstract":"We propose a novel soft-output joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) algorithm for multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.

Then, in order to minimize the error function for a better sampling performance, a reinforcement learning mechanism is proposed for random scan Gibbs sampling to adaptively update the selection probabilities by learning from the random samples generated along with the chain.

By allowing the possibility of amplifying certain signals within the DNN, power consumption is characterized and then optimized via KKT conditions. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed analysis and demonstrate the significant power efficiency gains that are possible via optimization for a target mean squared error.","doi":"10.1109/ITW48936.2021.9611431","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611366/9611357/09611431.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW48936.2021.9611431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Deep Neural Networks with Noisy Memristor Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Deep Neural Networks with Noisy Memristor Implementation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","publicationDate":"17 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611431/","conferenceDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient Deep Neural Networks with Noisy Memristor Implementation","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570727036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056409S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611366","isNumber":"9611357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611366","xplore-issue":"9611357","articleId":"9611431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9611432,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Jiang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37088930291"},{"name":"Yu Lu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37089158519"},{"name":"Xueru Li","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xueru","lastName":"Li","id":"37089159436"},{"name":"Bichai Wang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bichai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089160745"},{"name":"Yongxing Zhou","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yongxing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089157704"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0312-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3137-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611432","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Precoding","Simulation","Millimeter wave technology","Interference","Complexity theory","Convolutional neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611432","doi":"10.1109/ITW48936.2021.9611432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW48936.2021.9611432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611357","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611366/9611357/09611432.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attention-Based Hybrid Precoding for mmWave MIMO Systems","abstract":"Hybrid precoding design is a high-complexity problem due to the coupling of analog and digital precoders as well as the constant modulus constraint for the analog precoder. Fortunately, the deep learning based hybrid precoding methods can significantly reduce the complexity, but the performance remains limited. In this paper, inspired by the attention mechanism recently developed for machine learning, we propose an attention-based hybrid precoding scheme for millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems with improved performance and low complexity. The key idea is to design each user\u2019s beam pattern according to its attention weights to other users\u2019. Specifically, the proposed attention-based hybrid precoding scheme consists of two parts, i.e., the attention layer and the convolutional neural network (CNN) layer. The attention layer is used to identify the features of inter-user interferences. Then, these features are processed by the CNN layer for the analog precoder design to maximize the achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the attention layer could mitigate the inter-user interferences, and the proposed attention-based hybrid precoding with low complexity can achieve higher achievable sum-rate than the existing deep learning based method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611432/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","publicationDate":"17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Attention-Based Hybrid Precoding for mmWave MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attention-Based Hybrid Precoding for mmWave MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570726414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078425S","chronDate":"17-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611366","isNumber":"9611357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611366","xplore-issue":"9611357","articleId":"9611432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9611495,"authors":[{"name":"Charalambos D.

To solve this problem, this paper introduces attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron, combining CNN algorithm with BiLSTM algorithm. The attention mechanism is used to extract key information of electronic medical records, and the multi-layer perceptron splits local features learned by CNN, contextual semantic features learned by BiLSTM and key EMR features extracted by attention mechanism. This paper proposes a model of CNN-attention-BiLSTM for tumor marker detection prediction. It can be used in tumor marker detection and prediction. The experiment showed that compared with the model without attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron, the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 value increased by 6.87%, 4.42% and 5.06% respectively. In this paper, this model is compared with traditional machine learning classification algorithms. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this model is 7.77% higher than that of Naive Bayes, which has the best classification effect, and 17.97% higher than that of SVM, which has the worst classification effect. Through experimental comparison, it can be concluded that the model proposed in this paper can better help doctors to assist decision-making to a certain extent.","doi":"10.1109/MLISE54096.2021.00016","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MLISE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLISE54096.2021.00016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611640","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MLISE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611639/9611640/09611697.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction model of tumor marker examination based on fusion of CNN and bilstm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611697/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction model of tumor marker examination based on fusion of CNN and bilstm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9611697/","publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction model of tumor marker examination based on fusion of CNN and bilstm","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"173600a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062221S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611639","isNumber":"9611640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611639","xplore-issue":"9611640","articleId":"9611697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9611730,"authors":[{"name":"Qiqi Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai Electric Power Research Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088850753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1736-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1737-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611730","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Recurrent neural networks","Power transmission","Predictive models","Data models","Power system reliability","Reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric power","predicted quality","two-layer LSTM","Attention mechanism","two-branch LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611730","abstract":"Electric power is an important energy source for national development. Power resources are not only closely related to people's lives, but also related to a country's economy. In addition, the three main processes of power generation, power transmission, and power consumption must be highly coupled together. In recent years, domestic power consumption has gradually increased, causing huge power consumption, which may lead to unexpected power outages and other major accidents. The relevant part must strike a balance between power supply quality and economic benefits. The predicted quality directly affects the economic feasibility and reliability of each power company. In this paper, combining the real power load data of a power plant in Slovakia and the real power load data of a certain region of my country, the two-layer LSTM model, the LSTM model combined with the Attention mechanism, and the two-branch LSTM model are proposed and verified. Based on the experimental results of the two datasets, this paper finds that because the two-branch LSTM model has the highest model complexity, it has the best fit to the load data, and the prediction results are the most accurate.","doi":"10.1109/MLISE54096.2021.00018","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611639/9611640/09611730.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MLISE)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MLISE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLISE54096.2021.00018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting Short-term Power Grid Load Based on Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2021","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting Short-term Power Grid Load Based on Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611730/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting Short-term Power Grid Load Based on Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"173600a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062769S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611639","isNumber":"9611640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611639","xplore-issue":"9611640","articleId":"9611730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9611789,"authors":[{"name":"Kaveri Mahapatra","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaveri","lastName":"Mahapatra","id":"37089156544"},{"name":"David J.

Furthermore, sensors and sensor behaviors need to be emulated with grid simulations to perform modeling studies and to design cutting edge power systems applications. Ensuring the accurate behavior of these applications requires accurate emulation of sensors and pertinent signals. However, most grid simulators and modeling tools assume either zero error scenarios or simplistic noise models that may not always correlate to realworld sensors. To address the above issue, this work presents an initial study on the noise characteristics of phasor measurement units (PMUs), along with models for recreating their unique noise signatures. The proposed methods (both analytical and machine-learning-based) provide a substantial increase in a sensor's model fidelity, a feature that can be leveraged by an end-user application to yield more accurate system representations. The proposed methods were then applied to micro PMU data from the EPFL microgrid campus to extract sensor noise profiles. This data was used to train a deep learning model, which was tested to emulate the noise characteristics present in actual signals. Based on the observed results and the employed data-driven methodology, the proposed methods may be adapted to replicate the behavior of other grid sensors and power new applications capable of detecting sensor degradation and eventual device failures in near real-time.","doi":"10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611789","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Resilience Week (RWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611370/9611784/09611789.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Resilience Week (RWS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Data Driven Noise Emulation Framework using Deep Neural Network for Generating Synthetic PMU Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Novel Data Driven Noise Emulation Framework using Deep Neural Network for Generating Synthetic PMU Measurements","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9611789/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611789/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Data Driven Noise Emulation Framework using Deep Neural Network for Generating Synthetic PMU Measurements","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"ID-000779_NovelDataDrivenNoiseEmulation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09776S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611370","isNumber":"9611784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611370","xplore-issue":"9611784","articleId":"9611789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9611792,"authors":[{"name":"Shaya Wolf","affiliation":["Idaho National Lab, National and Homeland Security, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Idaho Falls, ID, USA","Cybersecurity Education and Research Lab, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA"],"firstName":"Shaya","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37086437249"},{"name":"Rita Foster","affiliation":["Idaho National Lab, National and Homeland Security, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Foster","id":"37089156806"},{"name":"Jed Haile","affiliation":["Idaho National Lab, National and Homeland Security, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Idaho Falls, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Jed","lastName":"Haile","id":"37089157543"},{"name":"Mike Borowczak","affiliation":["Cybersecurity Education and Research Lab, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Borowczak","id":"38132949500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2905-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2906-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611792","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"abstract":"This work posits that suitability analyses that pair machine learning best practices with domain knowledge mapped to statistically significant metrics can determine boundaries for responsible data usage in machine learning models.

This process is repeatable and automate-able such that data that is not fit for @DisCo can be blocked and inaccurate results would be replaced with an explanation of why data is not fit for the model.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Analytical models","Machine learning","Data models","Malware","Graph theory","Cleaning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611792","publicationTitle":"2021 Resilience Week (RWS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Resilience Week (RWS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611370/9611784/09611792.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Suitability Analysis to Enable Machine Learning Explainability and Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Suitability Analysis to Enable Machine Learning Explainability and Security","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611792/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"18 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611792/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Suitability Analysis to Enable Machine Learning Explainability and Security","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"ID-000477_DataDrivenSuitabilityAnalysis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074877S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611370","isNumber":"9611784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611370","xplore-issue":"9611784","articleId":"9611792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9611874,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengzhi Lu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhengzhi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086832784"},{"name":"Xiao Liang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37089162937"},{"name":"Guoan Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guoan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38004307500"},{"name":"Deyang Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Deyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088536702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0757-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9517-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0758-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611874","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611874","abstract":"Recently, small-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a hot research topic due to the fewer training parameters and shorter training time, while their accuracy is generally degraded compared with large-scale CNNs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a small-scale CNN with sparse representation (a sparse small-scale CNN) for image classification. First, the Gabor filter is a representative sparse representation, so we integrate it into the standard AlexNet to establish a sparse Gabor-AlexNet architecture to better extract the feature of images. Second, to improve further the performance of the above Gabor-AlexNet., a learnable Gabor-AlexNet with only the increase of a few learning parameters is constructed for image classification. Finally, we test the Gabor-AlexNet on small-scale datasets including Extended Yale B, CASIA-FaceV5., Original Brodatz and, DTD. The proposed method outperforms the standard AlexNet in the precision and speed as classification benchmark. Then, our learnable Gabor-AlexNet is also superior to the Gabor-AlexNet for classification performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICICSP54369.2021.9611874","startPage":"425","endPage":"431","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information Communication and Signal Processing (ICICSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611818/9611829/09611874.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information Communication and Signal Processing (ICICSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICSP54369.2021.9611874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-scale Convolutional Neural Networks with Learnable Gabor Filter for Image Classifications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Signal processing","Information filters","Feature extraction","Hardware","Gabor filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","Sparse representation","Gabor filter","Learnable Gabor filter","AlexNet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Small-scale Convolutional Neural Networks with Learnable Gabor Filter for Image Classifications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9611874/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673314,61573272"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-scale Convolutional Neural Networks with Learnable Gabor Filter for Image Classifications","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"088_S071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053533S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611818","isNumber":"9611829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611818","xplore-issue":"9611829","articleId":"9611874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9611906,"authors":[{"name":"Siqi Lv","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, College of Science, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Siqi","lastName":"Lv","id":"37088874500"},{"name":"Zhiping Wang","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, College of Science, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404939700"},{"name":"Junying Na","affiliation":["Dalian Maritime University, College of Science, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Junying","lastName":"Na","id":"37089162100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0757-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9517-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0758-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611906","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Heart","Adaptation models","Sensitivity","Heart beat","Tools","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["arrhythmia","SENet","Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory","feature fusion"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arrhythmia Classification of Merged Features Method Based on SENet and BiLSTM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611906","doi":"10.1109/ICICSP54369.2021.9611906","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information Communication and Signal Processing (ICICSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information Communication and Signal Processing (ICICSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611818/9611829/09611906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICSP54369.2021.9611906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611829","abstract":"Arrhythmia is a common cardiovascular disease.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for detecting arrhythmia effectively. However, it is time-consuming for clinician to read ECG recording and detect arrhythmia. Thus, automatic arrhythmia detection system attracts attention recently. A novel dual-scale dilated convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify heartbeat of arrhythmia. Considering comprehensive using ECG information, we combine single heartbeat with corresponding ECG segment as input information. And then, dual-scale input is fed into DDCNN, which includes fully connected layers, dilated convolution layers and pooling layers. Compared with conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), dilated CNN can improve receptive field to have access to a wider range of information. Further, different kernel sizes help convolution kernel to obtain numerous informative features. Finally, the proposed DDCNN is verified by the open dataset and reaches 99.25% accuracy and 93.74% macro F1 score. Compared with other baseline models, DDCNN can achieve good model performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of DDCNN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9611941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9611941/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Dual-scale Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Heartbeat Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Dual-scale Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Heartbeat Classification","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"039_S063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073186S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9611818","isNumber":"9611829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9611818","xplore-issue":"9611829","articleId":"9611941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":9611986,"authors":[{"name":"Jinlei Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jinlei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088831611"},{"name":"Yunqing Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yunqing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088832825"},{"name":"Yanrui Jin","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanrui","lastName":"Jin","id":"37087016554"},{"name":"Xiaojun Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085668785"},{"name":"Liqun Zhao","affiliation":["Shanghai First People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liqun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087013324"},{"name":"Chengliang Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chengliang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292985700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0757-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9517-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0758-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9611986","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9611986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Sensitivity","Neural networks","Manuals","Electrocardiography","Signal processing","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["arrhythmia","electrocardiogram","P-wave detection","convolutional neural network"]}],"abstract":"P-wave is one of the most important waveforms in electrocardiogram (ECG), and an accurate P-wave detection method is of great significance for the automatic diagnosis of arrhythmia diseases.

In data-scarce or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, learned templates overfit the data and lack smoothness, which can affect the predictive performance of downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose GPCDL, a convolutional dictionary learning framework that enforces priors on templates using Gaussian Processes (GPs). With the focus on smoothness, we show theoretically that imposing a GP prior is equivalent to Wiener filtering the learned templates, thereby suppressing high-frequency components and promoting smoothness. We show that the algorithm is a simple extension of the classical iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, independent of the choice of GP kernels. This property allows one to experiment flexibly with different smoothness assumptions. Through simulation, we show that GPCDL learns smooth dictionaries with better accuracy than the unregularized alternative across a range of SNRs. Through an application to neural spiking data, we show that GPCDL learns a more accurate and visually-interpretable smooth dictionary, leading to superior predictive performance compared to non-regularized CDL, as well as parametric alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3127471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09612002.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3127471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Process Convolutional Dictionary Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Process Convolutional Dictionary Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612002/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Process Convolutional Dictionary Learning","sourcePdf":"lsp-song-3127471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062515S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9612002","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9612008,"authors":[{"name":"Dongyuan Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dongyuan","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0003-0768-6386","id":"37085792086"},{"name":"Woon-Seng Gan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Woon-Seng","lastName":"Gan","orcid":"0000-0002-7143-1823","id":"37268712600"},{"name":"Bhan Lam","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bhan","lastName":"Lam","orcid":"0000-0001-5193-6560","id":"37086308057"},{"name":"Xiaoyi Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0003-4883-3514","id":"37088822894"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9612008","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Penalty Factor for the MOV-FxLMS Algorithm in Active Noise Control System","abstract":"The minimum output variance filtered reference least mean square (MOV-FxLMS) algorithm is a effective algorithm that utilizes the penalty mechanism to help the active noise control (ANC) system achieve noise cancellation with constrained output variance or power.

In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a promising simplified VNLE equalizer for SiPM based OFDM-VLC systems according to SiPM's characteristics. Results show that the proposed equalizer outperforms the MPE in terms of BER and significantly reduces the computational complexity of the conventional VNLE. With the proposed equalization scheme, a data rate of 1.35Gbps has been achieved.

First, we design an alignment procedure that aligns the simulated environment with the real-world scene observed in the video.

Two-way TOA measurements between AN-UD pairs are obtained via round-trip communications to achieve localization and synchronization (LAS) for a UD. Existing LAS method for a moving UD with clock drift adopts an iterative algorithm, which requires accurate initialization and has high computational complexity. In this letter, we propose a new closed-form two-way TOA LAS approach, namely CFTWLAS, which does not require initialization, has low complexity and empirically achieves optimal LAS accuracy. We first linearize the LAS problem by squaring and differencing the two-way TOA equations. We employ two auxiliary variables to simplify the problem to finding the analytical solution of quadratic equations. Due to the measurement noise, we can only obtain a raw LAS estimation from the solution of the auxiliary variables. Then, a weighted least squares step is applied to further refine the raw estimation. We analyze the theoretical error of the new CFTWLAS and show that it empirically reaches the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with sufficient ANs under the condition of proper geometry and small noise. Numerical results in a 3D scenario verify the theoretical analysis that the estimation accuracy of the new CFTWLAS method reaches CRLB in the presented experiments when the number of ANs is large, the geometry is appropriate, and the noise is small. Unlike the iterative method whose complexity increases with the iteration count, the new CFTWLAS has constant low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3127486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09612074.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3127486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Form Two-Way TOA Localization and Synchronization for User Devices With Motion and Clock Drift","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Two-Way TOA Localization and Synchronization for User Devices With Motion and Clock Drift","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","volume":"29","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612074/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2020-04661"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Form Two-Way TOA Localization and Synchronization for User Devices With Motion and Clock Drift","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhang-3127486-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063491S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9612074","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9612077,"authors":[{"name":"Hafiz Imtiaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9612077/imtia-3126546-small.gif","p":["Hafiz Imtiaz received the B.Sc. and first M.Sc. degrees from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, the second M.Sc. degree from Rutgers University New Brunswick, NJ, USA, in 2017, and the Ph.D. degree from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, in 2020.

To leverage larger sample sizes, different data holders/sites may wish to collaboratively learn feature representations. However, such datasets are often privacy-sensitive, precluding centralized analyses that pool the data at one site. In this work, we propose a differentially private algorithm for performing ICA in a decentralized data setting. Due to the high dimension and small sample size, conventional approaches to decentralized differentially private algorithms suffer in terms of utility. When centralizing the data is not possible, we investigate the benefit of enabling limited collaboration in the form of generating jointly distributed random noise. We show that such (anti) correlated noise improves the privacy-utility trade-off, and can reach the same level of utility as the corresponding non-private algorithm for certain parameter choices. We validate this benefit using synthetic and real neuroimaging datasets. We conclude that it is possible to achieve meaningful utility while preserving privacy, even in complex signal processing systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3126546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09612077.pdf","startPage":"6355","endPage":"6370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3126546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612077/","displayDocTitle":"A Correlated Noise-Assisted Decentralized Differentially Private Estimation Protocol, and its Application to fMRI Source Separation","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612077/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US NIH","grantNumber":"1R01DA040487"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1453432"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006503","fundingName":"Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command","grantNumber":"N66001-15-C-4070"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Correlated Noise-Assisted Decentralized Differentially Private Estimation Protocol, and its Application to fMRI Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tsp-imtiaz-3126546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142447S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9612077","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9612090,"authors":[{"name":"Wenju Xu","affiliation":["OPPO US Research Center, InnoPeak Technology Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/9626658/9612090/xu-3125266-small.gif","p":["Wenju Xu received the master\u2019s degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA, in 2019.

Existing approaches rely on a cycle-consistency constraint that supervises the generators to learn an inverse mapping. However, learning the inverse mapping introduces extra trainable parameters and it is unable to learn the inverse mapping for some domains. As a result, they are ineffective in the scenarios where (i) multiple visual image domains are involved; (ii) both structure and texture transformations are required; and (iii) semantic consistency is preserved. To solve these challenges, the paper proposes a unified model to translate images across multiple domains with significant domain gaps. Unlike previous models that constrain the generators with the ubiquitous cycle-consistency constraint to achieve the content similarity, the proposed model employs a perceptual self-regularization constraint. With a single unified generator, the model can maintain consistency over the global shapes as well as the local texture information across multiple domains. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance over state-of-the-art models. It is more effective in representing shape deformation in challenging mappings with significant dataset variation across multiple domains.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2021.3125266","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/9626658/09612090.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"84","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3125266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9626658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Domain Gap Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-Domain Image Translation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Domain Gap Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-Domain Image Translation","volume":"31","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","pubMedId":"34762587","publicationDate":"2022","htmlLink":"/document/9612090/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2021-04244"},{"fundingName":"United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","grantNumber":"2019-67021-28996"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain Gap Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-Domain Image Translation","sourcePdf":"tip-xu-3125266-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091478S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9626658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9626658","articleId":"9612090","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9612171,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Ahmad","affiliation":["College of Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9612171/ahmad-3127575-small.gif","p":["Irfan Ahmad received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control systems from the University of Grenoble (Grenoble Institute of Technology), France, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He was worked as a Research and Teaching Assistant with the GIPSA-Laboratory and Polytech Grenoble, University of Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France, from 2010 to 2011, and then with the Laboratoire de Conception et d\u2019Int\u00e9gration des Syst\u00e8mes (LCIS) and ESISAR, Valence, France, from 2011 to 2012.

A multi-axis 3D piezoelectric actuator is attached with the STM tip to move it in horizontal (x and y) and vertical (z) directions. The purpose of control design is to achieve precise reference tracking for horizontal 2D scanning system and to keep the tunneling current constant in the vertical direction in the presence of all possible disturbances. A usual practice is to design independent single-input-single-output (SISO) controllers for individual x, y and z axes by neglecting the cross-coupling dynamics of the multi-axis 3D piezoelectric actuator. In this paper, a complete 3D STM system, without neglecting the cross-coupling dynamics as well as the hysteresis nonlinearity of the actuator, is first mathematically modeled. The parameters of the hysteresis model are identified from the real-time experimental data by using the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting problem. A feedforward compensator is then designed without finding an inverse hysteresis model to avoid any inverse modeling complexity.

In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company\u2019s risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9612182/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"aiSTROM\u2013A Roadmap for Developing a Successful AI Strategy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"MOE2018-T2-2-161"},{"fundingName":"SRG ISTD 2017 129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"aiSTROM\u2013A Roadmap for Developing a Successful AI Strategy","sourcePdf":"access-herremans-3127548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122243S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9612182","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9612220,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Lopez-Martin","affiliation":["ETSIT, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9612220/lopez-3127689-small.gif","p":["Manuel Lopez-Martin (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in machine learning applied to network traffic analysis and prediction from the University of Valladolid, Spain, in 2019.

The classification is based on information extracted from the network flow packets. This is a complex classification problem with unbalanced datasets and noisy data. This work extends the classic radial basis function (RBF) neural network by including it as a policy network in an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. With this approach, all parameters of the radial basis functions (along with the network weights) are learned end-to-end by gradient descent without external optimization. We further explore how additional dense hidden-layers, and the number of radial basis kernels influence the results. This novel approach is applied to five prominent intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, AWID, CICIDS2017 and CICDDOS2019) achieving better performance metrics than alternative state-of-the-art models. Each dataset provides different restrictions and challenges allowing a better validation of results. Analysis of the results shows that the proposed architectures are excellent candidates for designing classifiers with the constraints imposed by network intrusion detection. We discuss the importance of dataset imbalance and how the proposed methods may be critically important for unbalanced datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127689","startPage":"153153","endPage":"153170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09612220.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Intrusion Detection Based on Extended RBF Neural Network With Offline Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612220/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network Intrusion Detection Based on Extended RBF Neural Network With Offline Reinforcement Learning","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9612220/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014440","fundingName":"Proyectos de I+D+i \u226aRetos investigaci\u00f3n\u226b, Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, Plan Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica, T\u00e9cnica y de Innovaci\u00f3n 2017\u20132020","grantNumber":"RTI2018-098958-B-I00"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry for Science, Innovation and Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011033","fundingName":"Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n (AEI)"},{"fundingName":"Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Network Intrusion Detection Based on Extended RBF Neural Network With Offline Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"access-lopezmartin-3127689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131555S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9612220","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9612226,"authors":[{"name":"Sourjya Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9612226/roy-3127517-small.gif","p":["Sourjya Roy received the bachelor\u2019s degree (Hons.) from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2018, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, under the guidance of Prof. A.

The increasing compute demands of DNNs have been widely addressed through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized accelerators. However, as model sizes grow, these von Neumann architectures require very high off-chip memory bandwidth to keep the processing elements utilized, as a majority of the data resides in the main memory. Processing in memory is actively being explored as a promising solution to the memory wall bottleneck for ML workloads. In this work, we propose a new DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) multiplication primitive coupled with intra-bank accumulation to accelerate matrix vector multiply operations in ML workloads. The proposed multiplication primitive adds <1% area overhead and does not require any change to the DRAM peripherals. Subsequently, we design a DRAM-based PIM architecture (PIM-DRAM) and a data mapping scheme for executing DNNs on the proposed architecture. System evaluations performed on the AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet18 DNNs show that the proposed architecture, mapping, and data flow can provide up to 19.5x speedup over an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU, highlighting the potential of processing in memory for future generations of DNN hardware.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09612226.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PIM-DRAM: Accelerating Machine Learning Workloads Using Processing in Commodity DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612226/","displayDocTitle":"PIM-DRAM: Accelerating Machine Learning Workloads Using Processing in Commodity DRAM","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612226/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Center for Brain Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), one of six centers in the Joint University Microelectronics Program (JUMP), a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PIM-DRAM: Accelerating Machine Learning Workloads Using Processing in Commodity DRAM","sourcePdf":"jetcas-roy-3127517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039612S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9612226","onlineDate":"13 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9612318,"authors":[{"name":"Yehia Fahmy","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Fahmy","id":"37089167063"},{"name":"Ayman El-Hag","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayman","lastName":"El-Hag","id":"38270609600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1564-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4686-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-6791"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2334-0975"}],"articleNumber":"9612318","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Network topology","Neural networks","Prediction algorithms","Topology","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image processing","machine learning","deep learning","outdoor insulators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EIC49891.2021.9612318","pdfPath":"/iel7/9611374/9611375/09612318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)","startPage":"490","endPage":"493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9611375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIC49891.2021.9612318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Convolution Neural Network in Hydrophobicity Classification","abstract":"Evaluating silicone rubber outdoor insulators surface condition is crucial to ensure their health conditions.

The objective of this paper is use deep learning to classify non-ceramic insulators hydrophobicity. Moreover, the efficiency of deep learning will be compared with the traditional machine learning (ML) approach. A previous dataset will be used as the database for this paper.

It is also caused by the thermodynamics of the system which is not ideal. Therefore, analytical batch distillation modeling does not fulfill superposition theory, or is nonlinear. Thus, any well-established linear control schemes can not be applied here. Meanwhile, modeling a system using the Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) is quite widely used today because of its ability to represent non-linear system dynamics. This paper propose a system identification using NARX Neural Network (NARX-NN) to modeling batch distillation process. In order to prove the superiority of NARX-NN's accuracy in the system identification process, a comparison with linear ARMA models is done. In this study, ARMA approximation was carried out in two ways. The first way is to use a neural network, while the second method is through approximation to the discrete transfer function. The validation results show that the NARX-NN achieves significantly better fit compared to the linear models.

In the previous similarity matching prediction methods, the similarity measure is calculated based on the Euclidean distance at the same time point. This single calculation method ignores the shape similarity of the health indicator curve. In addition, it is difficult to solve the similarity matching problem for testing instances with a short running time and rapid degradation trend. To address the above drawbacks, this paper proposes a similarity matching scheme based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for mechanical RUL prediction, which is a companion article to our previous work on prediction schemes using BiGRU network, attention mechanism and skip connection (BiGRU-AS). The DTW algorithm measures the similarity between relative time points to consider the shape similarity of health indicator curves. In the end, the proposed method is validated on two datasets: the milling datasets and the railway wagon wheel wear dataset.

The capsule robots perform non-invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy on patients. With the application of artificial intelligence in the capsule robot, the images collected by the capsule can be read efficiently and accurately offline. However, since the previous capsules either lacked wireless data transmission or only used Bluetooth data transmission, real-time interaction was not yet possible. It is very helpful for the diagnosis of the patient\u2019s condition. However, due to the lack of real-time interaction, it is still only an early diagnosis and cannot be applied to real-time treatment. In other words, patients still need to undergo invasive surgery after the gastrointestinal capsule endoscopy. The capsule robot proposed in this paper transmits data through Wi-Fi, detects and locates the lesion in real-time using a deep neural network named SEG-YOLOv5. It provides real-time feedback of the endoscopy, which shows a potential of non-invasive treatment or surgery. The experimental result shows that the model detection mAP@0.5 of 10 fold cross-validation on the open-access dataset Kvasir-SEG reaches 97.77% and the dice coefficient is 85.03% for lesion segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/WRCSARA53879.2021.9612694","startPage":"140","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"2021 WRC Symposium on Advanced Robotics and Automation (WRC SARA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WRCSARA53879.2021.9612694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612614","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 WRC Symposium on Advanced Robotics and Automation (WRC SARA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9612612/9612614/09612694.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WCE with real time polyp detection and segmentation using deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612694/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"WCE with real time polyp detection and segmentation using deep neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612694/","publicationDate":"11 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","conferenceDate":"11-11 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-11 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WCE with real time polyp detection and segmentation using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071666S","chronDate":"11-11 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9612612","isNumber":"9612614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9612612","xplore-issue":"9612614","articleId":"9612694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9612723,"authors":[{"name":"Yicheng Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9612723/jiang-3121499-small.gif","p":["Yicheng Jiang is currently pursuing the master\u2019s degree in electronic and communication engineering with the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China.

In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for mmWave beamforming in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to achieve the aforementioned goals with low complexity in such scenarios. In doing so, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to maximize the network\u2019s energy efficiency subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraint for each user equipment (UE) and obtain its hybrid beamforming matrices. In doing so, we assume each UE is simultaneously associated with multiple access points (APs), i.e., simultaneous beamforming to/from multiple APs (coordinated multipoints) is needed for each UE. We also propose a low-complexity training algorithm, based on approximate message passing, which is well suited for the network edge. Besides, we develop a distributed scheme to reduce communications overhead via federated DRL. Extensive simulations show significant performance improvement over existing methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radio frequency","Interference","Training","Synchronization","Reinforcement learning","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High mobility","mmWave connectivity","hybrid beamforming","fast federated deep reinforcement learning","edge computing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/9653871/09612729.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3126056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast MIMO Beamforming via Deep Reinforcement Learning for High Mobility mmWave Connectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast MIMO Beamforming via Deep Reinforcement Learning for High Mobility mmWave Connectivity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612729/","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9612729/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland 6G Flagship","grantNumber":"318927"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast MIMO Beamforming via Deep Reinforcement Learning for High Mobility mmWave Connectivity","sourcePdf":"jsac-sharafat-3126056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098115S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"9653871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","xplore-issue":"9653871","articleId":"9612729","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9612756,"authors":[{"name":"Mengze Sun","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mengze","lastName":"Sun","id":"37089159160"},{"name":"Zhisheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537904700"},{"name":"Yifan Zhou","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38466848000"},{"name":"Zhijie Xia","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Xia","id":"37089161281"},{"name":"Zhiting Zhou","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiting","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37089159593"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Xuzhou University of Technology"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089159158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0131-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0130-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2979-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9612756","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Data models","Plasmas","Timing","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","PECVD","Multi-sensor data","CNN","LSTM","Regression"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612756","pdfPath":"/iel7/9612652/9612653/09612756.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolution and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for PECVD Process Quality Prediction","abstract":"Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) is the most important process in the manufacturing of solar panels, and the deposition effect determines the energy conversion efficiency of solar panels. In this process, multi-sensor data is collected by the system for quality prediction and control. Existing research on quality prediction only pays attention to one of temporal characteristics and spatial characteristics but ignores the other. The multi-sensor data collected in the PECVD process has the characteristics of time series data, and the data collected by different sensors is also relevant, so it is necessary to integrate the temporal characteristics and the spatial characteristics. This paper proposes a hybrid prediction network model and uses Convolutional-LSTM Network to establish a regression model between multi-sensor data and deposition quality, then evaluates the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model and the single model. In the proposed hybrid prediction model, the spatial characteristics of the data are extracted through the convolutional neural network (CNN), and then the temporal characteristics of the data are extracted through the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The results show that compared with existing prediction models, the proposed CNN-LSTM method reduces the prediction error by at least 31% without significantly improving the convergence time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612756/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612756/","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Convolution and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for PECVD Process Quality Prediction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolution and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for PECVD Process Quality Prediction","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"570394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086688S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9612652","isNumber":"9612653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9612652","xplore-issue":"9612653","articleId":"9612756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9612764,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Kong","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Kong","id":"37088640094"},{"name":"Fulei Chu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fulei","lastName":"Chu","id":"37401858000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0131-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0130-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2979-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9612764","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Vibrations","Training","Dictionaries","Costs","Manuals","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault diagnosis","data-driven","sparse representation","self-similarity information","supervised classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612764","abstract":"Data-driven machine diagnostics is vital to intelligent maintenance and operation of various modern complex industrial systems. However, classical data-driven fault diagnosis techniques depend upon manually designed features or the expert knowledge, which greatly limits their applicability in automatic and intelligent diagnostic system. In this study, a new sparsity-assisted supervised classification (SASC) approach is proposed to learn discriminative features automatically for robust fault diagnosis. Our proposed SASC approach involves two stages for dictionary design and fault recognition. First, SASC designs the structured whole dictionary in a data-driven way considering the self-similarity information of vibration data within and across multiple health states. Second, SASC implements fault recognition using a sparse classification strategy based on the minimal reconstruction errors. Compared to classical data-driven fault diagnosis methods, SASC can get rid of the manual feature design and selection, enabling automatic and robust fault diagnosis. The SASC approach has been verified with gearbox datasets in the 2009 IEEE PHM data challenge. Besides, comparison results with several traditional sparse representation-based classification approaches prove the superiority of the SASC approach for data-driven machine diagnostics.","doi":"10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612764","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9612652/9612653/09612764.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-assisted Supervised Classification Approach with Application to Data-driven Machine Diagnostics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-assisted Supervised Classification Approach with Application to Data-driven Machine Diagnostics","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612764/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612764/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-assisted Supervised Classification Approach with Application to Data-driven Machine Diagnostics","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"570374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081826S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9612652","isNumber":"9612653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9612652","xplore-issue":"9612653","articleId":"9612764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9612851,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Peng","id":"37089157211"},{"name":"Wei ShangGuan","affiliation":["the State Key Laboratory Rail Traffic Control, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"ShangGuan","id":"37583892700"},{"name":"Baigen Cai","affiliation":["the State Key Laboratory Rail Traffic Control, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Baigen","lastName":"Cai","id":"37409875200"},{"name":"Yulong Xing","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Xing","id":"37089156333"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0131-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0130-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2979-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9612851","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Measurement","Costs","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Maintenance engineering","Generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component: Fault Prediction","On-board Equipment of CTCS","Seq2Seq model","LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612851","abstract":"Efficient fault prediction can improve system reliability and reduce maintenance costs. With the rapid development of deep learning, more and more people apply related methods in the field of fault prediction.

In this paper, we proposed a fault prediction method for on-board equipment of CTCS based on the seq2seq model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Firstly, we use a time series generator to capture the possible feature of the time to the subsequent fault from historical fault data. Then, these features are fed into the seq2seq model, which has an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder and decoder each use a layer of LSTM network, and a linear layer is used to realize the fault prediction of the on-board equipment of CTCS. Finally, we verified the method on the maintenance data from 2015 to 2019. The result shows that compared with other methods, this method has better effect on three performance metrics.","doi":"10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612851","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9612851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612653","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9612652/9612653/09612851.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Prediction Method for on-board Equipment of CTCS based on Seq2Seq Model using LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9612851/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Prediction Method for on-board Equipment of CTCS based on Seq2Seq Model using LSTM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9612851/","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005089","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Prediction Method for on-board Equipment of CTCS based on Seq2Seq Model using LSTM","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"570400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046999S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9612652","isNumber":"9612653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9612652","xplore-issue":"9612653","articleId":"9612851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9612860,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Guan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement Technology and Instrumentation of Hebei Province, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37088988184"},{"name":"Zong Meng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement Technology and Instrumentation of Hebei Province, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Zong","lastName":"Meng","id":"37086592255"},{"name":"Dengyun Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement Technology and Instrumentation of Hebei Province, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Dengyun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086874158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0131-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0130-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2979-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9612860","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9612860","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Employee welfare","Vibrations","Economics","Neural networks","Rolling bearings","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Imbalanced datasets","Data enhancement","Voting method of ensemble learning"]}],"abstract":"Rolling bearing is one of the main components of rotating machinery, timely and accurate fault diagnosis plays an important role in the reliability and safety of modern industrial systems.

To address this issue, a physics-informed transfer learning-based approach is proposed.

Due to the large-scale monitoring data collected in industrial processes, data-driven methods based on deep learning have been widely used in fault diagnosis. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), which has parallel architectures and larger receptive fields, does not suffer from gradient problems and has shown better performance than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in fault diagnosis. However, the generic TCN architecture pays equal attention to different monitoring variables and might degrade the fault diagnosis accuracy when some important parts of input data need to be emphasized. Hence, we propose a novel TCN-based fault diagnosis framework, called Attention Mechanism Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network (AME-TCN). Attention mechanism is good at distinguishing the importance of different monitoring variables and could enhance the performance of TCN for fault diagnosis by weighting each variable to highlight more diagnosis-related parts. For performance validation, AME-TCN model was applied for Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Experimental results indicated that AME-TCN method not only outperformed than traditional CNN and RNN models, but also enhanced the fault diagnosis ability of TCN.","doi":"10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9613040","pdfPath":"/iel7/9612652/9612653/09613040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","publicationTitle":"2021 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Nanjing)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PHM-Nanjing52125.2021.9613040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9612653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AME-TCN: Attention Mechanism Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"AME-TCN: Attention Mechanism Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Processes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"15 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9613040/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AME-TCN: Attention Mechanism Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Processes","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"570297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090399S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9612652","isNumber":"9612653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9612652","xplore-issue":"9612653","articleId":"9613040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9613065,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089158800"},{"name":"Yuanhang Wang","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Electronic Information Products Reliability Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yuanhang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089156653"},{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085706536"},{"name":"Xuebing Xu","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xuebing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37089155711"},{"name":"Xiaoting Li","affiliation":["School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoting","lastName":"Li","id":"37089159195"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0131-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0130-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2979-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9613065","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613065","abstract":"Threaded connection is one of the most widely used connection methods in automobile manufacturing industry.

As such, by constructing the measurement matrix with timing offsets, the joint estimation problem can be formulated as a generalized multiple measurement vector (MMV) recovery problem with structured sparsity.

In order to facilitate the beam-searching, we propose a new training method with Huffman-like hierarchical codebook (HLHC) for beam-searching in which apriori information of user's location is utilized. Unlike the traditional methods that normally construct the code-book with uniform length, the proposed method contrives a code-book whose code-words have unequal-lengths determined by their respective apriori information. Specifically, the length of a code-word is shorter if its corresponding direction occurs more during the past searches. Under the condition that the apriori information is known, the received signal strength in the sample-direction is measured to determine the incident direction of the signal to locate the user. The BS is used as an anchor to communicate with user in millimeter-wave carrier, where the influence of path-loss and shadowing is considered. Different from the previous single-beam and multi-beam training, the new beam training method can be divided into two sub-tasks. One task is code-book scanning, which uses the varied-length code-words similar to Huffman codes, and divides the sample elements into bins corresponding to different code-word lengths based on the apriori information. Another task is to identify samples and compare the parameter relationship between the received signal power and threshold power in each direction by an approximate bisection method. It does not need to traverse all possibilities like single beam training, thus greatly reducing the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613262","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613139","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613136/9613139/09613262.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Millimeter wave technology","Signal processing algorithms","Massive MIMO","Signal processing","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam training","localization","hierarchical codebook","millimeter-wave","massive MIMO antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast Beam-Training Based on Huffman-Like Hierarchical Codebook for mm-Wave Massive MIMO","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613262/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613262/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Beam-Training Based on Huffman-Like Hierarchical Codebook for mm-Wave Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1570745273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.171655S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613136","isNumber":"9613139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613136","xplore-issue":"9613139","articleId":"9613262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9613264,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Steven Aguilar Mendoza","affiliation":["Facultad de Ciencias Matem\u00e1ticas, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Per\u00fa"],"firstName":"Hans Steven","lastName":"Aguilar Mendoza","id":"37089164246"},{"name":"Erik Alex Papa Quiroz","affiliation":["Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Universidad Privada del Norte, Lima, Per\u00fa"],"firstName":"Erik Alex","lastName":"Papa Quiroz","id":"37088556090"},{"name":"Miguel Angel Cano Lengua","affiliation":["Facultad de Ingiener\u00eca de Sistemas e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica del Per\u00fa, Lima, Per\u00fa"],"firstName":"Miguel Angel","lastName":"Cano Lengua","id":"37088558039"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4445-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4444-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4446-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9613264","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613264","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer science","Gradient methods","Systematics","Conferences","Bibliographies","Minimization","Portfolios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["conjugate gradient method","quasiconvex functions","nonconvex functions","optimization problems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613145","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Engineering International Research Conference (EIRCON)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Engineering International Research Conference (EIRCON)","doi":"10.1109/EIRCON52903.2021.9613264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview on Conjugate Gradient Methods for Optimization, Extensions and Applications","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613138/9613145/09613264.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIRCON52903.2021.9613264","abstract":"This paper aims to identify the current state of the art of the latest research related to Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods for unconstrained optimization through a systematic literature review according to the methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charter, to answer the following research questions: Q1: In what research areas are the conjugate gradient method used?

In this paper, we realize K-multipacket reception (K-MPR) with sparse code multiple access (SCMA) technology to improve spectrum efficiency and throughput, and yet its implementation greatly increases the difficulty of ensuring the reliability of data transmission. Therefore, we propose an optimization method to maximize service quality of SCMA grant-free access with MPR.

The economic feasibility of developed methods is, however, limited by their requirement for large amounts of labeled training data. As an alternative, Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have been proposed, which do not rely on large-scale datasets and often require defect-free images only. In our work, we benchmark and adapt proposed state-of-the-art AD as well as Anomaly Segmentation (AS) methods to the Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) preform closure inspection task in a high-throughput setting. We furthermore compare AD/AS methods with fully supervised baselines and show that, in the low-data regime, comparable AS performance can be achieved. Moreover, fully supervised baselines are outperformed with respect to AD by our adapted methods. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the effects of proposed modifications, and show that they reduce memory footprint by a factor of 3 while maintaining AD/AS performance. Together, this demonstrates the suitability of AD/AS methods for the automated visual inspection of complex objects such as transparent PET preform closures in high-throughput settings.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613298","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA )","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613141","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA )","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613137/9613141/09613298.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection for the Automated Visual Inspection of PET Preform Closures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613298/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection for the Automated Visual Inspection of PET Preform Closures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613298/","publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection for the Automated Visual Inspection of PET Preform Closures","confLoc":"Vasteras, Sweden","sourcePdf":"EF-001023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08903S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613137","isNumber":"9613141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613137","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9613141","articleId":"9613298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9613311,"authors":[{"name":"Guangwei Li","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Guangwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37089168250"},{"name":"Shuxue Ding","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Shuxue","lastName":"Ding","id":"37271955200"},{"name":"Yujie Li","affiliation":["School of Artificial Intelligence, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Li","id":"37089170167"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0785-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0786-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-3746"}],"articleNumber":"9613311","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613311","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Deep learning","Musical instrument digital interfaces","Neural networks","Data preprocessing","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","long short-term memory","generative adversarial network","audio conversion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613311","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613136/9613139/09613311.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel LSTM-GAN Based Music Generation","abstract":"With the rapid development of deep learning, many models for music generation have emerged. There are, however, many problems for methods based on the general neural network model, such as slow calculation speed, complex calculation, and long-term dependence. This study proposes a combined model method for music generation, in which the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and generative adversarial network (GAN) are combined to form an LSTM-GAN model.

Large-scale wireless connection has become the main connection method of the future factory version in the Industrial 4.0. However, The short-packet based status update scenario is not well investigated in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with large scale wireless connections. In this paper, we analyze the state update process of the massive multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) relaying system with short-packet, propose and derive a system average age of information (AoI). Then, we study an asymptotic case with a large number of antennas, and obtain its closed-form expression. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and show that the system status update performance can be improved by increasing the number of antennas at the relay. We also find there exists optimal status packet length and pilot length that lead to the minimum system average AoI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613368/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613368/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Massive MU-MIMO Relaying IIoT Networks with Short-Packet: Timely Status Updates","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62171464,61771487"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801103"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MU-MIMO Relaying IIoT Networks with Short-Packet: Timely Status Updates","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1570752543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098623S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613136","isNumber":"9613139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613136","xplore-issue":"9613139","articleId":"9613368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9613387,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Rippel","affiliation":["Institute of Imaging & Computer Vision, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Rippel","id":"37086886926"},{"name":"Dorit Merhof","affiliation":["Institute of Imaging & Computer Vision, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dorit","lastName":"Merhof","id":"37397398200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2989-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-2990-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9613387","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613387","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Sensitivity","Transfer learning","Semantics","Object detection","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Segmentation","Transfer Learning","Probability Density Estimation","Gaussian Density Estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613387","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613137/9613141/09613387.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA )","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA )","startPage":"01","endPage":"04","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging pre-trained Segmentation Networks for Anomaly Segmentation","abstract":"Employing representations generated by large-scale training in a transfer-learning setting achieves state-of-the-art anomaly segmentation results when applied to the visual inspection task. Current approaches, however, focus exclusively on features of pre-trained classification networks, which are known to posess lower spatial resolution than segmentation or object detection networks. In our work, we investigate whether features extracted from pre-trained segmentation networks can be used to further improve anomaly segmentation performance in the transfer-learning setting. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art transfer-learning methods to encoder-decoder based segmentation networks. Results show that the encoders of pre-trained segmentation networks yield improved anomaly segmentation performance compared to their pre-trained classification counterparts. However, no consistent improvements can be observed yet regarding the decoders of the pre-trained segmentation networks. Together, this demonstrates that pre-trained segmentation networks can be used to further improve transfer-learned anomaly segmentation performance and that additional research is required to fully unleash their potential.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613387/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613387/","publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Leveraging pre-trained Segmentation Networks for Anomaly Segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging pre-trained Segmentation Networks for Anomaly Segmentation","confLoc":"Vasteras, Sweden","sourcePdf":"EF-005606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066708S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613137","isNumber":"9613141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613137","xplore-issue":"9613141","articleId":"9613387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9613431,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zhaohan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089167729"},{"name":"Liang Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China","Purple Mountain Laboratory, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37595548500"},{"name":"Zaichen Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China","Purple Mountain Laboratory, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zaichen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37440503100"},{"name":"Jian Dang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China","Purple Mountain Laboratory, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Dang","id":"37585843700"},{"name":"Bingcheng Zhu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Bingcheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38546840400"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086038541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0785-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0786-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-3746"}],"articleNumber":"9613431","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Wireless communication","Deep learning","5G mobile communication","Simulation","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Angle of Arrival","Channel State Information","Deep Neural Network","Localization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613431","abstract":"Indoor localization based on the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication technology has drawn much attention owing to its potential for supporting location based services.

In this paper, we propose a three-stream CNN-LSTM model, which takes three features carefully extracted as inputs. Different from the existing AMC methods, we extract phase features, amplitude features, and frequency features as the input of the neural network. We propose a three-stream network combining CNN and LSTM. CNN can extract the spatial features of the signal, and LSTM can extract the deep features of the signal from the time domain. The three-stream network can interactively fuse the three features and then further extract the spatiotemporal features of the signal through CNN-LSTM. Using this structure, we finally achieve a recognition rate of 94.6%. At the same time, the network complexity and training time are also very considerable. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the network structure in the existing networks.","doi":"10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613477","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613139","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613136/9613139/09613477.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Stream CNN-LSTM Network for Automatic Modulation Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613477/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Three-Stream CNN-LSTM Network for Automatic Modulation Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613477/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62022019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Stream CNN-LSTM Network for Automatic Modulation Classification","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1570752373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066984S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613136","isNumber":"9613139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613136","xplore-issue":"9613139","articleId":"9613477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9613495,"authors":[{"name":"Yarong Li","affiliation":["Jiangsu Province's Key Lab of Image Processing and Image Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yarong","lastName":"Li","id":"37089171684"},{"name":"Dong Hu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Province's Key Lab of Image Processing and Image Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","Education Ministry's Engineering Research Center of Ubiquitous Network and Heathcare Service, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","Education Ministry's Key Lab of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37709024200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0785-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0786-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-3746"}],"articleNumber":"9613495","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Correlation","Convolution","Computed tomography","Liver","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Liver tumor segmentation","enhanced CT","U-Net SEU-Net","3D convolution","C-LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613495","abstract":"An abdominal CT liver tumor segmentation algorithm based on three-channel cascade SEU-Nets and C-LSTM is proposed in this paper.

Finally, the decoder outputs fine segmentation of liver tumor output. 40 sets of high-quality abdominal-enhanced CT images of the liver and liver tumors used in the experiment were collected in the provincial central hospital and annotated by experts. Comparisons are carried out with well-known methods, such as improved CFCNs, H-DenseUNet network and DBAs-based multi-scale DC-CUNets segmentation network.

Energy harvesting (EH) relaying which can simultaneously transfer wireless information and harvest power helps to solve the problem. In this paper, a two-way EH beamforming network with relay nodes is proposed, where the power of the relays is not restricted. Specifically, the relays can gain energy entirely through energy harvesting by using the power splitting method, which makes the optimization of power distribution (PS) factor more complicated and difficult to calculate. To this end, we establish a joint optimization design model of PS factor with the two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) beamforming network, and propose to use the gradient descent algorithm to deal with the non-linear problem. The simulations show that our method can obtain the optimization results efficiently.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9613558/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Harvesting Relaying in Two-Way AF Beamforming Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Harvesting Relaying in Two-Way AF Beamforming Network","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1570753561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082799S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613136","isNumber":"9613139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613136","xplore-issue":"9613139","articleId":"9613558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":9613570,"authors":[{"name":"Leixin Han","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Leixin","lastName":"Han","id":"37086531345"},{"name":"Jiaheng Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089169355"},{"name":"Jianjun Zhang","affiliation":["University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089165394"},{"name":"Yongming Huang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37089172574"},{"name":"Kang Zheng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","China Mobile Zijin Innovation Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37089166024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0785-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0786-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-3746"}],"articleNumber":"9613570","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the waveform shaping for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Unlike the previous literature, we take both the PAPR of the transmitted signal and the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the received signal into account and constrain the average power of the transmitted signal. For this purpose, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly minimizes the PAPR and EVM under constant average power constraint. Due to the non-convexity of the power constraint, the optimization problem is difficult to solve. To end this, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the joint optimization problem. Furthermore, to improve the capability of the algorithm for a large number of subcarriers, we develop another efficient optimization algorithm.

equipped with low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Specifically, the channel non-reciprocities consist of the amplitude and phase non-reciprocities at the APs and user equipments. Closed-form expressions of the achievable sum-rates are derived for evaluating the impacts of channel non-reciprocities and DAC resolutions and comparing against the conjugate beamforming (CB) counterpart. Simulation results reveal that the downlink sum-rates are immune to the amplitude non-reciprocity of transceivers but strongly sensitive to the AP phase non-reciprocity. In particular, a small degree of AP phase non-reciprocity can result in substantial rate degradations. Besides, 5-bit DACs are enough in CF-mMIMO systems to approach the same sum-rates as CF-mMIMO systems with high-resolution DACs. Moreover, the NCB scheme outperforms the CB scheme in terms of the downlink sum-rates for both reciprocal and non-reciprocal channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9613578/","displayDocTitle":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Normalized Conjugate Beamforming and Channel Non-Reciprocities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2020YFB1806608,2018YFC1314903"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071246,61771252,62071252"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Normalized Conjugate Beamforming and Channel Non-Reciprocities","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"1570752059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064453S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613136","isNumber":"9613139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613136","xplore-issue":"9613139","articleId":"9613578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9613632,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Li","id":"37088748804"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538912600"},{"name":"Guoru Ding","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Guoru","lastName":"Ding","id":"37586009000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0785-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0786-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7628"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-3746"}],"articleNumber":"9613632","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Chaotic communication","Convolution","Simulation","Predictive models","Chebyshev approximation","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaotic frequency-hopping sequence","phase space reconstruction","temporal convolutional network","sequence prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613632","abstract":"Chaotic sequence is often used in FH communications because of its good properties.

Total variation (TV) regularization is adopted in many image processing applications to preserve the local smoothness. However, TV prior is prone to oversmoothness, staircasing effect, and contrast losses. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) mitigates the contrast losses by adaptively weighting the smoothness based on the similarity measure of image patches. Although it suppresses the noise effectively in the flat regions, it might leave residual noise surrounding the edges especially when the image is not oversmoothed. To address this problem, we propose the bilateral spectrum weighted total variation (BSWTV). Specially, we apply a locally adaptive shrink coefficient to the image gradients and employ the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the weighted image gradients to effectively refine the weighting map and suppress the residual noise. In conjunction with the data fidelity term derived from a mixed Poisson\u2013Gaussian noise model, the objective function is decomposed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In order to remove the outliers and facilitate the convergence stability, the weighting map is smoothed by a Gaussian filter with an iteratively decreased kernel width and updated in a momentum-based manner in each ADMM iteration. We benchmark our method with the state-of-the-art approaches on the public real-world datasets for super-resolution and image denoising. Experiments show that the proposed method obtains outstanding performance for super-resolution and achieves promising results for denoising on real-world images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral Spectrum Weighted Total Variation for Noisy-Image Super-Resolution and Image Denoising","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3127679","endPage":"6341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09613758.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3127679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613758","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image denoising","TV","Image edge detection","Imaging","Noise reduction","Noise measurement","Superresolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Super-resolution","denoising","total variation","mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise","ADMM","computed tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral Spectrum Weighted Total Variation for Noisy-Image Super-Resolution and Image Denoising","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613758/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9613758/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung","grantNumber":"105M18VSA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral Spectrum Weighted Total Variation for Noisy-Image Super-Resolution and Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"tsp-sun-3127679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09856S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9613758","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":9613760,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Biao Gao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Biao","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Bing-Zhao Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing-Zhao","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-3850-4656"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9613760","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","Fourier transforms","Time-frequency analysis","Uncertainty","Kernel","Quaternions","Convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Octonion Fourier transform","octonion short-time Fourier transform","convolution theorem","uncertainty principle","linear time-varying"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Octonion Short-Time Fourier Transform for Time-Frequency Representation and Its Applications","abstract":"The octonion Fourier transform (OFT) is a useful tool for signal processing and analysis. However, due to the lack of time localization information, it is not suitable for processing signals whose frequencies vary with time. In this paper, we utilize octonion algebra to propose a new method for time-frequency representation (TFR) called the octonion short-time Fourier transform (OSTFT). The originality of the method is based on the quaternion short-time Fourier transform (QSTFT). First, we generalize the QSTFT to the OSTFT by substituting the quaternion kernel function with the octonion kernel function in the definition of the QSTFT, and the physical significance of the OSTFT is presented. Then, several essential properties of the OSTFT are derived, such as linearity, inversion formulas, time-frequency shifts and orthogonality relations. Based on the classic Fourier convolution operation, the convolution theorem for the OSTFT is derived. We apply the relationship between the OFT and OSTFT to establish Pitt's inequality and Lieb's inequality for the OSTFT. According to the logarithmic uncertainty principle of the OFT, the logarithmic uncertainty principle associated with the OSTFT is investigated. Finally, an application in which OSTFT can be used to study linear time varying (LTV) systems is proposed, and some potential applications of the OSTFT are introduced.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09613760.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3127678","startPage":"6386","endPage":"6398","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3127678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Octonion Short-Time Fourier Transform for Time-Frequency Representation and Its Applications","volume":"69","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Octonion Short-Time Fourier Transform for Time-Frequency Representation and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-3127678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031835S","chronDate":"2021","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","articleId":"9613760","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9613851,"authors":[{"name":"Malik Summair Asghar","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea","COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Malik Summair","lastName":"Asghar","id":"37088659990"},{"name":"Muhammad Junaid","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Junaid","id":"37393699800"},{"name":"Hyung Won Kim","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung Won","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085414068"},{"name":"Saad Arslan","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37086289889"},{"name":"Syed Asmat Ali Shah","affiliation":["COMSATS University Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Asmat","lastName":"Ali Shah","id":"37088509624"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0174-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0175-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-9612"}],"articleNumber":"9613851","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Costs","Convolution","Neural networks","Capacitors","Hardware","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Operation","Analog Multiplier","Neural Network Accelerator","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613851","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks benefit from higher accuracy at the cost of higher hardware requirements and power consumption.

A digital parallel interfaced is designed to provide input image and filter values to the MAC unit. To realize an input layer for the CNN a low power ADC is then employed at the output to convert the final value back to digital value. When a 3\u00d73 convolution is performed the analog MAC unit offers area and power consumption benefits.","doi":"10.1109/ISOCC53507.2021.9613851","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613844/9613845/09613851.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"243","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 18th International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 18th International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISOCC53507.2021.9613851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digitally Controlled Analog kernel for Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Digitally Controlled Analog kernel for Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9613851/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digitally Controlled Analog kernel for Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"SS7-5-273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03425S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613844","isNumber":"9613845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613844","xplore-issue":"9613845","articleId":"9613851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9613856,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Chih Jimmy Chen","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Chih Jimmy","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089162705"},{"name":"Cheng-Ting Chen","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089162392"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0174-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0175-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-9612"}],"articleNumber":"9613856","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613856","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have shown their superiority in many applications of academia and industry. However, the hardware architecture of ANN requires a lot of operation units, which results in a high area and high-power overhead. On the other hand, the Stochastic Computing (SC) method has been proven as an efficient way to achieve low-power computing with a small area overhead. Therefore, many SC-based ANNs have been proposed in recent years. However, due to stochastic bit-stream computing, the conventional SC-based ANN designs suffer from low computing accuracy. In this work, we use the parallel counter (PC) to replace the SC-based multiply-accumulator (MAC) to solve the accuracy problem in conventional SC-based ANN designs. Besides, we propose a finite state machine (FSM)-based activation function to improve the efficiency of the data representation change in SC-based ANN computing. Compared with the conventional SC-based ANN designs, our proposed architecture can improve computing accuracy by 82.2%. Besides, our proposed architecture can reduce 95.8% area cost and 94.2% power consumption over than non-SC-based ANN design, which achieves higher hardware efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISOCC53507.2021.9613856","startPage":"254","endPage":"255","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 18th International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9613844/9613845/09613856.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 18th International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISOCC53507.2021.9613856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9613845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-accuracy and Low-latency Hybrid Stochastic Computing for Artificial Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industries","Costs","Power demand","Automata","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stochastic computing","neural network","parallel counter","ANN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9613856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"High-accuracy and Low-latency Hybrid Stochastic Computing for Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9613856/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-accuracy and Low-latency Hybrid Stochastic Computing for Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Jeju Island, Korea, Republic of","sourcePdf":"SS9-1-124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035869S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9613844","isNumber":"9613845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9613844","xplore-issue":"9613845","articleId":"9613856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9613941,"authors":[{"name":"Jingchao Lan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jingchao","lastName":"Lan","id":"37086540298"},{"name":"Yan Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37088932428"},{"name":"Yimin Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085872555"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089162095"},{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37289420800"},{"name":"Junyan Ren","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junyan","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0174-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0175-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-9612"}],"articleNumber":"9613941","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":27},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulation","Linearity","Switches","CMOS process","Topology","Leakage currents","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bootstrapped Switch","Leakage Current Suppression","High-Speed","High-Liearity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9613941","abstract":"This paper presents a leakage current suppressed (LCS) technique for high-speed bootstrapped switch.

He used this equivalence to give a method for measuring capacitance using a circuit employing a battery and galvanometer. The next publication came nearly a century later, when D. L. Fried proposed the idea of sampled-data analog filters \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref2\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[2]</xref>\n, containing only switches, capacitors and (if necessary) amplifiers. His paper showed how to realize the equivalent of a resistor using two switches and a capacitor. A motivation for using such circuits may be found from the history of analog filters. These were developed for telephony, and used initially resistors, capacitors and inductors. Inductors were bulky and lossy, and were replaced at the earliest opportunity by alternative circuits using amplifiers. The resulting active-RC filters were realized by discrete elements: capacitors, resistors and integrated-circuit amplifiers. With the development of integrated-circuit technology, there was strong motivation to put these filters on a single-substrate IC. However, the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">absolute</i>\n values of resistors and capacitors could only poorly be controlled by the fabrication process: errors of 20-30% were common. Since the errors of resistors and capacitors were not tracking each other, the errors of time constants given by RC products were unacceptably high. This made their frequency responses unpredictable. Trimming could be used to tune such filters, but this was expensive. When the resistors were replaced by their switched-capacitor (SC) equivalents, the RC time constants were replaced by time constants of the form \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${TC}_{1}/{C}_{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Since the switching period \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${T}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n can be accurately controlled, as can the ratio of on-chip capacitors, the SC filters (SCFs) could be implemented with high accuracy. The design of such filters initially was based on those of active-RC ones, but it was soon recognized that they can be more effectively designed directly in the sampled-data domain, in terms of the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${z}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n variable, similarly to digital filters. Although other design techniques exist, the most popular one constructs higher-order filters as a cascade of lower-order sections, such as biquadratic filter or \u201cbiquad\u201d shown in \n<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Figure 1</xref>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614083/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Switched-Capacitor Circuits [Education]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-Capacitor Circuits [Education]","sourcePdf":"21mcas04-education-3118195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038221S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"9614082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","xplore-issue":"9614082","articleId":"9614083","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9614086,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-636X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0830"}],"articleNumber":"9614086","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAS News From Romania [CAS in the World]","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2021.3118485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9614082","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7384/9614082/09614086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2021.3118485","startPage":"47","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9614086","abstract":"The first edition of the International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems, initially called Signals, Circuits and Systems, was organized in Ias\u201ai, Romania, by the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology of the \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University of Ias\u201ai in November 1993 as a joint event of the IEEE Romania CAS Chapter and the above-mentioned faculty. In a way, it is fair to say that the father of the symposium was Professor Florin Constantinescu from \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Bucharest, the first chairman of the CAS Chapter in Romania. He told me that the newly born CAS Chapter is expected to organize certain specific activities\u2014this was the moment when I promised to organize a symposium on CAS subjects in Ias\u201ai not only as a technical activity but also as an attempt to show our wishes to communicate, strengthen links with researchers outside Romania and in addition to show the beauty of Eastern region of this country. Fortunately, the idea was immediately accepted and supported by the Dean of our faculty at that time. As the first edition of the symposium was a success, we decided to continue organizing it every two years. We have been encouraged by many CAS Society presidents and representatives, among whom I will mention only Professor Tony Davies whose advice and support were instrumental for the organization of the first editions of the symposium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614086/","displayDocTitle":"CAS News From Romania [CAS in the World]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAS News From Romania [CAS in the World]","sourcePdf":"21mcas04-cas-in-the-world-3118485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018451S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"9614082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","xplore-issue":"9614082","articleId":"9614086","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9614087,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Zino","affiliation":["University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7384/9614082/9614087/zino.a1-3118100-small.gif","p":["Lorenzo Zino (Member, IEEE) is a PostDoc Researcher at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, since 2019.

The study of these models\u00d1grounded in the systems theory and often analyzed using control-theoretic tools\u00d1is an extremely important area for many researchers from different fields, including epidemiology, engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science, sociology, economics, and management. In this survey, we review the history and present the state of the art in the modeling, analysis, and control of epidemic dynamics. We discuss different approaches to epidemic modeling, either deterministic or stochastic, ranging from the first implementations of scalar systems of differential equations, which describe the epidemic spreading at the population level, to the most recent models on dynamic networks, which capture the spatial spread and the time-varying nature of human interactions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614087/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Prediction, and Control of Epidemics: A Survey from Scalar to Dynamic Network Models","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"ERC-CoG-771687"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research","grantNumber":"NWO-vidi-14134"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Prediction, and Control of Epidemics: A Survey from Scalar to Dynamic Network Models","sourcePdf":"21mcas04-zino-3118100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219715S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"9614082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","xplore-issue":"9614082","articleId":"9614087","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9614089,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7384/9614082/9614089/liu.a1-3118175-small.gif","p":["Bo Liu (Member, IEEE) was born in Taizhou, Jiangsu, China in 1984.

The trade-off between accuracy and power consumption under various background noises is achieved by using the 8-stage radix-2 single-path delay feedback FFT (R2SDF-FFT) and the precision self-adaptive architecture with approximate computing. The R2SDF-FFT structure with the fine-grained bit-width quantization can reduce 35.7% of memory size. Approximate multiplication and addition with Dual-Vdd are proposed to further improve the FFT computing energy efficiency. Finally, we present the precision self-adaptive MFCC architecture with the proposed FFT, which can be dynamically configured to use two calculation modes with different hardware settings according to the input speech background noise. Implemented and evaluated under 22 nm technology, the power consumption of the proposed design can be reduced by up to 76.3%, while the accuracy increased by 0.8%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614089/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614089/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Precision Adaptive MFCC Based on R2SDF-FFT and Approximate Computing for Low-Power Speech Keywords Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100018537","fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2018ZX01028101-005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62022041 and 61904028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision Adaptive MFCC Based on R2SDF-FFT and Approximate Computing for Low-Power Speech Keywords Recognition","sourcePdf":"21mcas04-liu-3118175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063043S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2021","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"9614082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","xplore-issue":"9614082","articleId":"9614089","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":9614090,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-636X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0830"}],"articleNumber":"9614090","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"From the beginning of the IEEE Yugoslav Section (in 1971), the first and thus the oldest chapter was the IEEE Joint Chapter Signal Processing/Circuits and Systems (SP-01/CAS-04), founded in 1988. Today, the SP/CAS Chapter of the IEEE Serbia and Montenegro Section has 85 active members as follows: 1 Fellow, 2 Life Senior, 9 Senior Members, 62 Members and 11 Student Members. The SP/CAS Chapter has been very active. Besides promoting IEEE, motivating young researchers to become IEEE members, and organizing annual chapter meetings, the chapter initiated many other events as tutorials and excellent talks (among the speakers were Leon Chua, Sanjit Mitra, Jacek Zurada, Jun Wang, Jelena Kovacevic, Ljiljana Trajkovic, Martin Vetterli, Petar Djuric, Zoran Obradovic, \u2026). Also, the chapter successfully organized a number of conferences, probably the most prominent being NEUREL (Symposium of Neural Networks and Applications). The NEUREL symposia started in 1990, just before the breakup of former Yugoslavia, as the enthusiastic work of Professors Mirko Milic (1932\u20131993) and Rajko Tomovic (1919\u20132001) from the University of Belgrade. Unfortunately, after the first NEUREL, the Civil War in the former Yugoslavia stopped many intellectual, cultural, and scientific activities. Surprisingly, NEUREL events survived despite the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia: the second NEUREL was held in the winter of 1992/93, under the enormous inflation in Serbia, as a weekend lecture series directed by Professor Mirko Milic\u00b4. Fortunately, the situation in this region improved after 1994 and the third NEUREL, organized by Professor Branimir Reljin (SM, LM), was held in 1995 under (almost) normal conditions. Since that time, the NEUREL symposia have been a biennial scientific meetings dealing with all aspects of artificial neural networks and fuzzy systems, from their theoretical foundations to realizations and applications. After 1997, NEURELs were technically co-sponsored by several IEEE societies and by IEEE Region 8. Unfortunately, in 2020, the 15th NEUREL was canceled due to COVID -19. In some sense, NEUREL is the continuation of the very prominent symposia ISYNT (International Symposium of Network Theory) organized by Professor Horvat from 1968 to 1989. The ISYNT symposia were attended by the best-known scientists in this field including J. Aggarwal, T. Bickart, H. Carlin, L. Chua, P. Civalleri, A. Davies, T. Deliyannis, C. Desoer, S. Dutta Roy, J. Fidler, A. Fettweis, M. Ghausi, E. Kuh, E. Laker, E. Lindberg, G. Martinelli, S. Mitra, G. Moschytz, J. Neirynck, R. Newcomb, A. Petrenko, T. Roska, R. Saal, J. Scanlan, G. Temes, Y. Tokad, M.

The reason of this title is very concrete: on this day of 1895 Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov formerly demonstrated his receiver for the transmission of electromagnetic waves at a session of Russian Chemical and Physical Society between several buildings of the St. Petersburg University. The device was not patented but a brief description of this device was published in the regional newspaper \u201cKronstadt Chronicles\u201d on May 12, 1985, as well as a paper in a journal \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n.

In this case, once the cache contents and the users\u2019 demands are known, the problem reduces to a general index coding problem. This paper shows that relying on a well-known \u201cacyclic index coding converse bound\u201d results in converse bounds that are not tight for combination networks with end-user-caches. A novel converse bound that leverages the network topology is proposed, which is the tightest converse bound known to date. As a result of independent interest, an inequality that generalizes the well-known sub-modularity of entropy is derived. Several novel caching schemes are proposed, based on the Maddah-Ali and Niesen cache placement. These schemes leverage the structure of the combination network or/and perform interference elimination at the end-users.

To quantify the robustness of these networks, we investigate three different performance measures: the steady-state variance of pairwise differences between vertex states, the steady-state variance of the deviation of each vertex state from the average, and the total steady-state variance of the system. We show that these performance measures are closely related to the concept of biharmonic distance; the square of the biharmonic distance plays a similar role in the system performance as resistance distance plays in the performance of first-order noisy consensus dynamics. We then define the new concepts of biharmonic Kirchhoff index and vertex centrality based on the biharmonic distance. We further derive analytical results for the performance measures and concepts for complete graphs, star graphs, cycles, and paths, and we use this analysis to compare the asymptotic behavior of the steady-state variance in first- and second-order systems. Finally, we propose a theoretically guaranteed approximation algorithm to estimate the total steady-state variance, which has a complexity of nearly linear time with respect to the number of edges. Extensive experiments results validate both efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3127272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3127272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9687099","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9687099/09614161.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9614161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Laplace equations","Coherence","Vehicle dynamics","Noise measurement","Resistance","Electrical resistance measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed average consensus","network coherence","Laplacian matrix","biharmonic distances","Gaussian white noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Biharmonic Distance-Based Performance Metric for Second-Order Noisy Consensus Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"68","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9614161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614161/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61872093"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1305104"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2018SHZDZX01 and 2021SHZDZX03"},{"fundingName":"ZJ Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Center for Brain Science and Brain-Inspired Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1553340"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biharmonic Distance-Based Performance Metric for Second-Order Noisy Consensus Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-zhang-3127272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.176382S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9614161","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9614165,"authors":[{"name":"Micha\u0142 Oszmaniec","affiliation":["Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland","International Centre for Theory of Quantum Technologies, University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Micha\u0142 Oszmaniec received the M.Sc. degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree the University of Warsaw, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.","Subsequently for four years, he held post-doctoral positions with The Institute of Photonic Sciences, Barcelona, and the National Center for Quantum Information, Gdansk.

We apply our findings in the context of quantum computing. First, we show that that approximate t-designs can be generated by shallow random circuits formed from a set of universal two-qudit gates in the parallel and sequential local architectures considered in (Brand\u00e3o et al., 2016). Importantly, our gate sets need not to be symmetric (i.e., contains gates together with their inverses) or consist of gates with algebraic entries. Second, we consider compilation of quantum gates and prove a non-constructive Solovay-Kitaev theorem for general universal gate sets. Our main technical contribution is a new construction of efficient polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta in the space of quantum channels, which can be of independent interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614165/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","volume":"68","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9614165/","displayDocTitle":"Epsilon-Nets, Unitary Designs, and Random Quantum Circuits","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TEAM-NET Project","grantNumber":"POIR.04.04.00-00-17C1/18-00"},{"fundingName":"National Science Centre, Poland","grantNumber":"SONATA BIS: 2015/18/E/ST1/00200"},{"fundingName":"TEAM-NET Project","grantNumber":"POIR.04.04.00-00-17C1/18-00"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001870","fundingName":"Foundation for Polish Science through the IRAP Project co-financed by EU within the Smart Growth Operational Programme","grantNumber":"2018/MAB/5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epsilon-Nets, Unitary Designs, and Random Quantum Circuits","sourcePdf":"tit-oszmaniec-3128110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170042S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9687099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9687099","articleId":"9614165","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9614191,"authors":[{"name":"Pooneh Safayenikoo","affiliation":["University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9614191/safay-3127907-small.gif","p":["Pooneh Safayenikoo received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.

These networks mostly use deep layers of convolution and/or fully connected layers with many filters in each layer, demanding a large amount of data and tunable hyperparameters to achieve competitive accuracy. As a result, storage, communication, and computational costs of training (in particular time spent for training) become limiting factors to scale them up. In this paper, we propose a new training methodology for ANNs that exploits the observation of improvement of accuracy shows temporal variations which allow us to skip updating weights when the variation is minuscule. During such time windows, we keep updating bias which ensures the network still trains and avoids overfitting; however, we selectively skip updating weights (and their time-consuming computations). This training approach virtually achieves the same accuracy with considerably less computational cost and reduces the time spent on training. We developed two variations of the proposed training method for selectively updating weights, and call them as i) Weight Update Skipping (WUS), and ii) Weight Update Skipping with Learning Rate Scheduler (WUS+LR). We evaluate these two approaches by analyzing state-of-the-art models, including AlexNet, VGG-11, VGG-16, ResNet-18 on CIFAR datasets. We also use ImageNet dataset for AlexNet, VGG-16, and Resnet-18. On average, WUS and WUS+LR reduced the training time (compared to the baseline) by 54%, and 50% on CPU and 22%, and 21% on GPU, respectively for CIFAR-10; and 43% and 35% on CPU and 22%, and 21% on GPU, respectively for CIFAR-100; and finally 30% and 27% for ImageNet, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09614191.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weight Update Skipping: Reducing Training Time for Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614191/","displayDocTitle":"Weight Update Skipping: Reducing Training Time for Artificial Neural Networks","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9614191/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight Update Skipping: Reducing Training Time for Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jetcas-safayenikoo-3127907-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051404S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9614191","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9614197,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Intelligent Wireless Networking Laboratory, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9614197/clin-3127914-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hung Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2016, and the M.S. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2018.

However, several factors contribute to GPS errors, decreasing the safety and precision of AV and ITS applications, respectively. Extensive research has been conducted to address this problem. More specifically, several optimization-based cooperative vehicle localization algorithms have been developed to improve the localization results by exchanging information with neighboring vehicles to acquire additional information. Nevertheless, existing optimization-based algorithms still suffer from an unacceptable performance and poor scalability. In this study, we investigated the development of deep learning (DL) based cooperative vehicle localization algorithms to provide GPS refinement solutions with low complexity, high performance, and flexibility. Specifically, we propose three DL models to address the problem of interest by emphasizing the temporal and spatial correlations of the extra given information. The simulation results confirm that the developed algorithms outperform existing optimization-based algorithms in terms of refined error statistics. Moreover, a comparison of the three proposed algorithms also demonstrates that the proposed graph convolution network-based cooperative vehicle localization algorithm can effectively utilize temporal and spatial correlations in the extra information, leading to a better performance and lower training overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127914","startPage":"153429","endPage":"153441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09614197.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GCN-CNVPS: Novel Method for Cooperative Neighboring Vehicle Positioning System Based on Graph Convolution Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Location awareness","Sensors","Radar","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Sensor systems","Safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative vehicle localization","data fusion","deep neural network (DNN)","graph convolution network (GCN)","long short-term memory (LSTM)","vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"GCN-CNVPS: Novel Method for Cooperative Neighboring Vehicle Positioning System Based on Graph Convolution Network","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9614197/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u201cCenter for mmWave Smart Radar Systems and Technologies\u201d and the \u201cCenter for Open Intelligent Connectivity\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001869","fundingName":"Visible Project at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 110-2221-E-007-042-MY3, MOST 110-2221-E-A49-025-MY2, MOST 110-2634-F-009-028, MOST 110-2224-E-A49-001 and MOST 110-2622-E-A49-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100014795","fundingName":"North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)","grantNumber":"TCE2020-03"},{"fundingName":"AC21 Special Project Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"GCN-CNVPS: Novel Method for Cooperative Neighboring Vehicle Positioning System Based on Graph Convolution Network","sourcePdf":"access-chang-3127914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078894S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9614197","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9614203,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolay Hinov","affiliation":["Power electronics Technical university of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Hinov","id":"37085849002"},{"name":"Bogdan Gilev","affiliation":["Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Method Technical university of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Gilev","id":"37085849766"},{"name":"Stoyan Popov","affiliation":["Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Method Technical university of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Stoyan","lastName":"Popov","id":"37088854757"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4873-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-6654-4872-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4874-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9614203","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks","Voltage","Mathematical models","Power electronics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["buck converter","neural network modeling and designer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9614203","abstract":"This paper aims to present an approach which modeling and design a buck DC-DC converter through feedforward neural networks (NN -

To solve this problem, in addition to the line NN called NN - model is created and the reverse - called NN - designer. The inverse network is used to determine the values of the converter elements. Thus, the paper presents an alternative way of designing power electronic devices, which is based on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, without applying computational procedures, according to a certain design methodology. In this aspect, this method of modeling and design is faster and more flexible than the standard approach, based on the analysis of the processes in the power scheme in an established mode of operation, after the completion of the transients. The proposed AI approach is confirmed by the parametric design of a synchronous Buck DC-DC converter, oriented to achieve maximum efficiency. The converter is applied in the autonomous power supply system by converting the input voltage from 20 V to 10 V. One of the main advantages of the model used is that it is invariant with respect to the different versions of the MATLAB.","doi":"10.1109/HiTech53072.2021.9614203","pdfPath":"/iel7/9614172/9614201/09614203.pdf","startPage":"01","endPage":"04","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IV International Conference on High Technology for Sustainable Development (HiTech)","publicationTitle":"2021 IV International Conference on High Technology for Sustainable Development (HiTech)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HiTech53072.2021.9614203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9614201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Design of a Buck DC-DC Converter with Feed Forward Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Design of a Buck DC-DC Converter with Feed Forward Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","publicationDate":"7 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614203/","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Design of a Buck DC-DC Converter with Feed Forward Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"2-6-Hinov_HiTech2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046377S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9614172","isNumber":"9614201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9614172","xplore-issue":"9614201","articleId":"9614203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9614371,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Konno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Miyagi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Konno","id":"38489698200"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Miyagi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088906601"},{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Miyagi-ken, Japan"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276134800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-986-847-871-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3113-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9614371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Dipole antennas","Artificial neural networks","Current distribution","Numerical simulation","Robustness","Arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Eigenmode Current","Source Reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9614371","abstract":"A method for finding defective elements in array antennas is introduced.

Research has shown that scaled-up low bitwidth NNs can have accuracy levels on par with their full-precision counterparts. As a result, there is a trade-off between quantization (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) and scaling (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$s$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) of NNs to maintain the accuracy. To capture that trade-off, in this paper, we propose QS-NAS which is a systematic approach to explore the best quantization and scaling factors for a NN architecture that satisfies a targeted accuracy level and results in the least energy consumption per inference when deployed to a hardware\u2013FPGA in this work. We first approximate the accuracy of a NN using a polynomial regression based on experiencing over a span of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$s$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

The method was evaluated on SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets trained on VGG-like and MobileNet-192 architectures, and the optimized models were deployed to Xilinx FPGAs for fully on-chip processing. The implementation results outperform the related work in terms of energy-efficiency and/or power consumption, yet having similar or higher accuracy. The proposed optimization method is fast, simple, and scalable to emerging technologies. Moreover, it can be used on top of other AutoML frameworks to maximize efficiency of running artificial intelligence on edge devices.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/9647029/09614655.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2021.3127932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9647029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QS-NAS: Optimally Quantized Scaled Architecture Search to Enable Efficient On-Device Micro-AI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614655/","displayDocTitle":"QS-NAS: Optimally Quantized Scaled Architecture Search to Enable Efficient On-Device Micro-AI","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9614655/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QS-NAS: Optimally Quantized Scaled Architecture Search to Enable Efficient On-Device Micro-AI","sourcePdf":"jetcas-hosseini-3127932-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108219S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9614655","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9614657,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoyun Song","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/9675003/9614657/song-3125285-small.gif","p":["Chaoyun Song (Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and electronics from The University of Liverpool (UoL), Liverpool, U.K., in 2012, 2013, and 2017, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with UoL from 2017 to 2020.

Investigations shows that generated electric field line changes the effective radius of cylinder which in turn changes the resonant frequency.

In this paper the resonant frequency is optimized and Genetic Algorithm has been used to calculate radius(w) and height(L) of the liquid in order to get desired result.

To reduce heat dissipation in radio transmitters, switched mode power amplifiers (PAs) can be used, the efficiency of which is as high as 95-98%. However, the high level of higher harmonics is a problem of such PAs. To reduce them to the required value, a staged voltage can be used. In this case, attention must be paid to the angle coordinates of the voltage stages. It is shown that even their insignificant deviations caused by different values of the transistor parameters significantly increase the level of higher harmonics. To solve this problem, a predistortion of control pulses should be implemented using a neural network.

Images become too dark and too noisy, which makes traditional enhancement techniques almost impossible to apply. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown very promising results for this task since they have substantially more expressive capabilities to allow for improved quality. Motivated by these studies, in this paper, we aim to leverage burst photography to boost the performance and obtain much sharper and more accurate RGB images from extremely dark raw images. The backbone of our proposed framework is a novel coarse-to-fine network architecture that generates high-quality outputs progressively. The coarse network predicts a low-resolution, denoised raw image, which is then fed to the fine network to recover fine-scale details and realistic textures. To further reduce the noise level and improve the color accuracy, we extend this network to a permutation invariant structure so that it takes a burst of low-light images as input and merges information from multiple images at the feature-level. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to perceptually more pleasing results than the state-of-the-art methods by producing more detailed and considerably higher quality images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9614963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9614963/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21275604","pubMedId":"34788215","volume":"30","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Burst Photography for Learning to Enhance Extremely Dark Images","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004412","fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"GEBIP 2018 Award"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008967","fundingName":"Science Academy","grantNumber":"BAGEP 2021 Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Burst Photography for Learning to Enhance Extremely Dark Images","sourcePdf":"tip-erdem-3125394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156262S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"9263394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","xplore-issue":"9263394","articleId":"9614963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9615028,"authors":[{"name":"Kaihua Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kaihua","lastName":"Fu"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-4840-0324"},{"name":"Quan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-5832-0347"},{"name":"Deze Zeng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Deze","lastName":"Zeng","orcid":"0000-0003-3276-1202"},{"name":"Minyi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minyi","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0003-0034-2302"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"9615028","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"User-facing services are now evolving towards the microservice architecture where a service is built by connecting multiple microservice stages. Since the entire service is heavy, the microservice architecture shows the opportunity to only offload some microservice stages to the edge devices that are close to the end users. However, emerging techniques often result in the violation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) of microservice-based services in cloud-edge continuum, as they do not consider the communication overhead or the resource contention between microservices and external co-located tasks. We propose Nautilus, a runtime system that effectively deploys microservice-based user-facing services in cloud-edge continuum. Nautilus ensures the QoS of microservice-based user-facing services while minimizing the required computational resources, which is comprised of a communication-aware microservice mapper, a contention-aware resource manager and an IO-sensitive and load-aware microservice migration scheduler. The mapper divides the microservice graph into multiple partitions based on the communication overhead and maps the partitions to appropriate nodes. On each node, the resource manager determines the optimal resource allocation for its microservices based on reinforcement learning that may capture the complex contention behaviors. Once the microservices are suffered from external IO pressure, the IO-sensitive microservice scheduler migrates the critical one to idle nodes. Furthermore, when the load of microservices changes dynamically, the load-aware microservice scheduler migrates microservices from busy nodes to idle ones to ensure the QoS goal of the entire service. Our experimental results show that Nautilus can guarantee the required QoS target under external shared resources contention while the state-of-the-art suffers from QoS violations. Meanwhile, Nautilus reduces the computational resource usage by 23.9% and the network bandwidth usage by 53.4%, while achieving the required 99%-ile latency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Resource Efficient Microservice Deployment in Cloud-Edge Continuum","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3128037","endPage":"1840","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9642402/09615028.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"1825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3128037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Cloud computing","Task analysis","Resource management","Computer architecture","Runtime","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud-edge continuum","QoS","microservice resources management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Resource Efficient Microservice Deployment in Cloud-Edge Continuum","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2022","volume":"33","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1004800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62022057, 61832006, 61632017 and 61872240"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Lab","grantNumber":"2021KE0AB02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Resource Efficient Microservice Deployment in Cloud-Edge Continuum","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-3128037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046097S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2022","isNumber":"9642402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","articleId":"9615028","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":9615039,"authors":[{"name":"Deepali Arun Bhanage","affiliation":["Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9615039/bhana-3128283-small.gif","p":["Deepali Arun Bhanage received the master\u2019s degree in computer engineering from the Sinhgad Institute of Technology, University of Pune.

Unavailability of any element or connection results in downtime and triggers monetary and performance casualties. Thus, reliability engineering has been a topic of investigation recently. The system logs become obligatory in IT infrastructure monitoring for failure detection, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses on detailed analysis based on the various qualitative and performance merits of datasets used, technical approaches utilized, and automated tools developed. The full-text review was directed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. 102 articles were extracted from Scopus, IEEE Explore, WoS, and ACM for a thorough examination. Also, a few more supplementary articles were studied by applying Snowballing technique. The study emphasizes the use of system logs for anomaly or failure detection and prediction. The survey encapsulates the automated tools under various quality merit criteria. This SLR ascertained that machine learning and deep learning-based classification approaches employed on selected features enable enhanced performance than traditional rule-based and method-based approaches. Additionally, the paper discusses research gaps in the existing literature and provides future research directions. The primary intent of this SLR is to perceive and inspect various tools and techniques proposed to mitigate IT infrastructure downtime in the existing literature. This survey will encourage prospective researchers to understand the pros and cons of current methods and pick an excellent approach to solve their identified problems in the field of IT infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128283","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09615039.pdf","startPage":"156392","endPage":"156421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IT Infrastructure Anomaly Detection and Failure Handling: A Systematic Literature Review Focusing on Datasets, Log Preprocessing, Machine & Deep Learning Approaches and Automated Tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"IT Infrastructure Anomaly Detection and Failure Handling: A Systematic Literature Review Focusing on Datasets, Log Preprocessing, Machine & Deep Learning Approaches and Automated Tool","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9615039/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Support the Fund of Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"IT Infrastructure Anomaly Detection and Failure Handling: A Systematic Literature Review Focusing on Datasets, Log Preprocessing, Machine & Deep Learning Approaches and Automated Tool","sourcePdf":"access-bhanage-3128283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.231896S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615039","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615040,"authors":[{"name":"Udari De Alwis","affiliation":["National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9615040/alwis-3128326-small.gif","p":["Udari De Alwis (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2014.

Such tasks routinely entail the high computational cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which conflicts with the tight power budget and memory capacity of sensor nodes at the edge. This paper introduces an approach to reduce the computational cost of object detection in CNN accelerators available in edge devices. The proposed approach induces additional feature map-level sparsity (i.e., computation skipping) at inference time by exploiting temporal correlation among frames. The proposed approach has an uncommonly favorable computation-memory tradeoff, as significant computation reduction is achieved at the cost of very small additional memory for the storage of intermediate features. As further benefits, no architectural changes or retraining are required, allowing immediate deployment in existing vision frameworks and suppressing the need for storing multiple models. Results show that the proposed TempDiff method achieves up to 37% computation reduction with 1.1% accuracy drop based on the SSD(VGG16) object detection network, under both VIRAT and ImageNet-VID datasets. Similarly, 18.3% (35.8%) computation reduction at 3.3% (3.2%) memory overhead, and 3.8% (6.8%) accuracy drop in YOLOv1 (VGG16) (SSD (VGG16)) is achieved under the CAMEL dataset. Furthermore up to 58% computation reduction with 2% accuracy drop and 3.7% memory overhead were achieved for YOLOv3-Tiny network under the ImageNet-VID dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","volume":"11","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9615040/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"TempDiff: Feature Map-Level CNN Sparsity Enhancement at Near-Zero Memory Overhead via Temporal Difference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF-CRP20-2017-0003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TempDiff: Feature Map-Level CNN Sparsity Enhancement at Near-Zero Memory Overhead via Temporal Difference","sourcePdf":"jetcas-dealwis-3128326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081277S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"9647029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","xplore-issue":"9647029","articleId":"9615040","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9615041,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Gohari","affiliation":["Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS), Khatam University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Amin Gohari (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 2010.

The broad adoption of radar sensors increases the chance of interference among sensors from different vehicles, generating corrupted range profiles and range-Doppler maps. In order to extract distance and velocity of multiple targets from range-Doppler maps, the interference affecting each range profile needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network for automotive radar interference mitigation. In order to train our network in a real-world scenario, we introduce a new data set of realistic automotive radar signals with multiple targets and multiple interferers. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply weight pruning in the automotive radar domain, obtaining superior results compared to the widely-used dropout. While most previous works successfully estimated the magnitude of automotive radar signals, we propose a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the phase. For instance, our novel approach reduces the phase estimation error with respect to the commonly-adopted zeroing technique by half, from 12.55 degrees to 6.58 degrees. Considering the lack of databases for automotive radar interference mitigation, we release as open source our large-scale data set that closely replicates the real-world automotive scenario for multiple interference cases, allowing others to objectively compare their future work in this domain.

Packet-level index modulation (PLIM) uses the frequency channel and the transmission timing of a packet as an information-bearing index. LPWA with PLIM can increase the number of information bits without changing the wireless communication standards despite adherence to the DC limits. However, there is still a gap between the achievable rate and the channel capacity. Multi-packet indexing determines an information-bearing index based on multiple packets. Thus, it can exploit the channel more efficiently, which results in an increased achievable rate. This study derives a mathematical formula for the achievable rate of PLIM with multi-packet indexing and clarifies the rate enhancement brought by it.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"154938","endPage":"154946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09615090.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Wireless communication","Channel models","Channel capacity","OFDM","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power wide area","packet-level index modulation","multi-packet indexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Rate Enhancement Based on Multi-Packet Indexing in Packet-Level Index Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615090/","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9615090/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009105","fundingName":"Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan through the project name Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Programme (SCOPE)","grantNumber":"JP205004001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP 18K04131"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Achievable Rate Enhancement Based on Multi-Packet Indexing in Packet-Level Index Modulation","sourcePdf":"access-takyu-3128168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208822S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615090","onlineDate":"15 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9615150,"authors":[{"name":"Sihem Mesnager","affiliation":["University of Paris VIII, Saint-Denis, France","Laboratory Analysis, Geometry and Applications (LAGA), CNRS, University Sorbonne Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France","Telecom Paris, Polytechnic Institute of Paris, Palaiseau, France"],"bio":{"p":["Sihem Mesnager (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI), Paris, France, in 2002, and the Habilitation to Direct Theses (H.D.R.) degree in mathematics from the University of Paris VIII, France, in 2012.

Despite the intense work on these codes, many problems are known to be hard (notably, determining their covering radius) and remain open to this day. Fourteen years ago, Carlet and Mesnager improved in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, \u201cImproving the Upper Bounds on the Covering Radii of Binary Reed-Muller Codes\u201d, 53(1), 2007] the upper bound on the covering radius of the Reed-Muller code of order 2, and they deduced improved upper bounds on the covering radii of the Reed-Muller codes of higher orders. Until 2021, these upper bounds remained the best ones in the literature. The Reed-Muller code \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RM(n-3,n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, which corresponds to the dual of the Reed-Muller code \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RM(2,n)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, has attracted much attention. One of the main reasons is that it is precisely the code that has been considered to get the upper bounds derived by Carlet and Mesnager. Those upper bounds have been obtained thanks to the characterization of the codewords of the Reed-Muller code, whose Hamming weights are strictly less than 2.5 times the minimum distance \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{n-r}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n due to Kasami, Tokura, and Azumi.

In order to meet the requirements of the quality inspection efficiency and accuracy for PET preform, a novel multi-stream deep CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model is performed to effectively identify and classify PET preform surface defects for the first time in this paper. In recent years, the method based on multi-stream feature fusion has a good application prospect in defect detection. In order to solve the problem of PET preform surface defects detection and classification, we study the deep CNN structure and propose a multi-stream deep network structure, which makes full use of the rich multi-feature information from different network structures. Two different deep CNNs are respectively trained to extract features from the original image, and one of them is trained to extract feature from the corresponding gradient image. We adopt wavelet transform fusion strategy to realize feature fusion and input them into ECOC-SVM (a classified Error Correcting Output Codes model using Support Vector Machines as binary learner) model for detection and classification. Using Bayesian optimization function to optimize the hyperparameters is performed to choose the best performance configuration. Through experimental analyses, the higher detection accuracy of the proposed method is 98.5%, and it is proved that the proposed model has good convergence, accuracy, stability and generalization ability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9615154/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Stream Deep Convolutional Neural Network for PET Preform Surface Defects Detection and Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Special Research Project in Key Fields of Artificial Intelligence in General Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019KZDZX1029"},{"fundingName":"Characteristic Innovation Research Project of University Teachers of Foshan City","grantNumber":"2019XJZZ06"},{"fundingName":"Characteristic Innovation Project in General Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2019GKTSCX117"},{"fundingName":"Special Fund for Science and Technology Innovation Strategy of Guangdong Province, in 2020","grantNumber":"pdjh2020b1221"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Stream Deep Convolutional Neural Network for PET Preform Surface Defects Detection and Classification","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-3128357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141465S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615154","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615185,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

The charging behavior consists of the charging duration level within a certain upper and lower range, the time slots in which charging will take place, the number of times charging will take place in each time slot, and whether the next day will be a charging day or not. Unlike existing work, we evaluate the behavior prediction performance for increasing resolutions of charging duration levels and charging time slots, using varying lengths of training data. The performance of the proposed approach is validated using real EV charging data, and comparison with other machine learning methods shows its generally superior prediction accuracy for all resolutions. We show that the best performance is achieved when around 8\u201310 months of data are used as training data. It is also shown that although the performance of the LSTMs degrades with increasing resolution, the performance for charging time slot prediction is affected less compared to that for charging duration prediction. We further propose, analyze and evaluate a new technique that improves the charging duration prediction performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9615185/","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of LSTMs for Daily Individual EV Charging Behavior Prediction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of LSTMs for Daily Individual EV Charging Behavior Prediction","sourcePdf":"access-khwaja-3128491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063628S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615185","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9615210,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The performance of the SDC highly depends on its location and the Input Control Signal (ICS) selected. Hence, a systematic method for selecting the best ICS- location pair for SDC is the need of the hour. Hence in this paper, a technique to identify the best ICS- location pair for SDC based on the right half-plane zero method, relative gain array method, and Henkel singular value is proposed. The performance of the proposed strategy is then compared with that of the generally used residue-based selection method and joint geometric controllability method. A proportional feedback controller based on the root locus method is designed to validate the results of the proposed method. Extensive simulation studies using MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09615210.pdf","startPage":"160332","endPage":"160346","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best Input\u2014Location Pair Selection for SSR Damping Controller in DFIG Based Wind Farms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Best Input\u2014Location Pair Selection for SSR Damping Controller in DFIG Based Wind Farms","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9615210/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Best Input\u2014Location Pair Selection for SSR Damping Controller in DFIG Based Wind Farms","sourcePdf":"access-sr-3128398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110719S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615210","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9615232,"authors":[{"name":"Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mustafa","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in BIT Medical Convergence, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9615232/musta-3128570-small.gif","p":["Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mustafa received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore, Pakistan, and the M.S. degree in signal processing and machine intelligence from the University of Surrey, U.K., in 2010.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid beamforming solution for sum rate maximization in a wideband multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) relay system. The problem at hand is non-convex and hence mathematically intractable due to the constant modulus constraints associated with the analog beamforming design at communicating nodes shared by all sub-carriers. Furthermore, relaying in MU-MIMO systems under frequency-selective channels is also a challenging task as it requires complicated signal processing. To address this problem, source analog beamformer, relay RF combiner and phase-only processing component at each destination are obtained by deriving the common RF processing matrix which enables beamforming gain over all sub-carriers. This process involves reconstruction loss minimization for designing the required analog beamforming vectors having ability to maximize end-to-end signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). The relay analog precoder is designed by maximizing the received power at each destination through gain maximization of the equivalent baseband channel over the allocated frequency spectrum. To reduce the computational complexity of the iterative approach used to find the relay RF precoding matrix, the closed form expression is derived for achieving the desired objective. Finally, digital baseband processing components are obtained from the equivalent baseband channels by suppressing the interference among transmitted signals indirectly. Simulation results for different system configurations reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09615232.pdf","startPage":"167521","endPage":"167544","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming for Sum Rate Maximization in Wideband Multi-User MIMO Relay Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming for Sum Rate Maximization in Wideband Multi-User MIMO Relay Systems","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9615232/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1D1A3B03032125"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Hybrid Beamforming for Sum Rate Maximization in Wideband Multi-User MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"access-mustafa-3128570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131941S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615232","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":9615238,"authors":[{"name":"Adel Aldalbahi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9615238/aldal-3128432-small.gif","p":["Adel Aldalbahi (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA, in 2011, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA, in 2013.

This technology provides contiguous bandwidth at the detriment of high path loss and blockage sensitivity. Hence beamforming architectures are leveraged to compensate for the channel impairments. However, beamforming introduces significant challenges in terms of initial beam access and beam adaptation requirements. Namely, the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">base station</i>\n (BS) and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mobile station</i>\n (MS) are compelled to search the entire spatial directions to specify the pointing directions (optimum beamforming and combining vectors) that yield in the strongest impinged signal levels.

The proposed scheme here predicts the primary sector with the highest popularity class at the BS, which is affiliated with the mostly used beamforming vector. This retrieves information about the sector locations with the highest MS traffic, thereby the BS can eliminate the spatial search over locations of scarce MS densities. Consequently, this process reduces the beam scanning search at the BS, while performing conventional search at the MS. The proposed scheme yields in reduced complexity and access times as compared to prominent existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9615238/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Primary Sector Prediction in FR2 New Radio Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004686","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research through King Faisal University","grantNumber":"187008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep Learning for Primary Sector Prediction in FR2 New Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"access-jasim-3128432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117095S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9615238","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9615300,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The technological advancement in the domain of artificial intelligence has aided in various handwritten recognition systems such as handwritten mathematical expression recognition. Symbol recognition and structural analysis are two major obstacles in handwritten mathematical expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network algorithm called validator, tracker, attention, and parser (VTAP). The hybrid neural network algorithms like CRNN is a blend of recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). It has shown better and more accurate outputs than the native CNN and RNN algorithms alone. CROHME dataset is used, which is the most widely used dataset. The recognition is divided into 4 parts validator, tracker, attention, and parser (VTAP). A tracker is equipped with a group of Bi-Directional Recurrent Network (BRNN) with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Succeeded by a tracker, the parser uses a GRU lead by guided hybrid attention.

The current conditions of the data sources are very different, and it offers a variety of writing systems. Therefore, the results of accuracy in sentiment analysis are very important. An improved approach was proposed to increase the sentiment analysis accuracy based on text pre-processing and Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier algorithm hybrid with Particle Swarm Optimization (NBC-PSO). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm solves the complex background problems about noise data and feature selection that affect the classification performance on sentiment analysis. This proceeded with the classification of positive or negative sentiments on these texts using NBC. Subsequently, the feature selection based on PSO was created to improve the accuracy. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach has a significant effect on sentiment score and polarity detection.","doi":"10.1109/ITSS-IoE53029.2021.9615311","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Intelligent Technology, System and Service for Internet of Everything (ITSS-IoE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615169/9615251/09615311.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Intelligent Technology, System and Service for Internet of Everything (ITSS-IoE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSS-IoE53029.2021.9615311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Selection based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sentiment analysis","Dictionaries","Media","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Internet of Things","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sentiment analysis","Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier","Particle Swarm Optimization","text pre-processing","English language","Indonesian language"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9615311/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","conferenceDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection based on Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis Classification","confLoc":"Sana'a, Yemen","sourcePdf":"ITSS-IoE_2021_CameraReady_PDFeXpress_22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071717S","chronDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615169","isNumber":"9615251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615169","xplore-issue":"9615251","articleId":"9615311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615325,"authors":[{"name":"AbdulRahman A.

However, the stochastic nature of its radiative energy has made its use undesirable to some consumers at various levels. In this manuscript, a state-of-the-art hybrid deep learning model is introduced to forecast PV power on an hourly basis. The CNN-LSTM model is a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. This hybrid model was trained using historical data of Johannesburg city with two different data compositions. The first experiment involved training the model with 80% of data collected over one year from Johannesburg city. The second experiment involved training the model with 80% of ten-year historical data from the same city. Using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, the results obtained were compared with results from CNN and LSTM time series models. It was discovered that the CNN-LSTM model outperformed all the other models used in the same experiment. For instance, at 1,000 epochs and with ten years of data composition, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model gave an RMSE value of 7.21 Watts/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n while the LSTM and CNN time series models recorded 7.30 Watts/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 12.67 Watts/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n respectively. This outcome indicates that a hybrid of CNN and LSTM for short-term PV power forecasting performs better than when the models are used individually. It is suggested that deploying the CNN-LSTM model for short-term PV power forecasting in Johannesburg\u2019s solar farms could be beneficial in stabilizing the PV power connection to the smart grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615335/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9615335/","publicationDate":"14 Oct. 2021","conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hourly Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hourly Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"ITMS_2021_paper_30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119667S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615167","isNumber":"9615247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615167","xplore-issue":"9615247","articleId":"9615335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":9615381,"authors":[{"name":"Pinaki S.

Maintaining the good health of cows is very much essential for the steady growth of milk production. Unfortunately, in a large dairy cow farm, day-to-day monitoring of the health status of individual cows is a complex and time-consuming activity. This paper proposed LiveCare, an IoT-based framework that automatically monitors the health of cows in a large cow farm. It tracks the cow\u2019s behavioral changes on a daily basis. This paper also proposed the Cow Disease Prediction (CDP) algorithm, which is an unsupervised multi-class classifier that serves as the LiveCare framework\u2019s central component. The CDP algorithm can predict several cow diseases by analyzing the cows\u2019 behavioral changes. In this framework, we have also tabulated a few common cow diseases, their measurable symptoms, and the various sensors used to record them. We compared the efficiency of the proposed CDP algorithm to that of other machine learning algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9615381/","displayDocTitle":"LiveCare: An IoT-Based Healthcare Framework for Livestock in Smart Agriculture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LiveCare: An IoT-Based Healthcare Framework for Livestock in Smart Agriculture","sourcePdf":"tce-ray-3128236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050789S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9615381","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9615404,"authors":[{"name":"Oleksandr Tymochko","affiliation":["Ivan Kozhedub Kharkiv National Air, Force University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Tymochko","id":"37088430120"},{"name":"Maksim Pavlenko","affiliation":["Ivan Kozhedub Kharkiv National Air, Force University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Maksim","lastName":"Pavlenko","id":"37088429169"},{"name":"Pavlo Open'ko","affiliation":["National Defense University of Ukraine named after Ivan Cherniakhovskyi, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Pavlo","lastName":"Open'ko","id":"37086345315"},{"name":"Volodymyr Larin","affiliation":["Ivan Kozhedub Kharkiv National Air, Force University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Larin","id":"37407970200"},{"name":"Osiievskyi Serhii","affiliation":["Ivan Kozhedub Kharkiv National Air, Force University, Kharkiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Osiievskyi","lastName":"Serhii","id":"37089163155"},{"name":"Maksym Kasianenko","affiliation":["National Defense University of Ukraine named after Ivan Cherniakhovskyi, Kyiv, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Maksym","lastName":"Kasianenko","id":"37088905597"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3822-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3823-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9615404","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Wires","Organizations","Streaming media","Reconnaissance","Unmanned aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transmission systems","videodata","information","compression","encryption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615404","abstract":"It was confirmed that for improving the efficiency of processing and delivery of videoinformation resourses using real-time communication systems required to implement cryptographic encryption simultaneously with the organization of the data compact representation.

Early awareness of LDEs before the layout stage gets critical in order to help subsequent layout synthesis meet performance requirements and thus reduce design iteration. In this article, we propose a high-dimensional many-objective Bayesian optimization (HMBO)-based LDE-aware sizing methodology to address such challenges. It can effectively tackle the huge configuration space that is incurred by the increased number of optimization variables for considering the LDEs in addition to the conventional sizing variables. Moreover, our proposed method is able to aim for simultaneously satisfying multiple circuit specifications to identify an optimum design point within the enlarged configuration space. In addition, we propose a performance-driven pattern learning scheme called Gibbs-upper confidence bound (UCB) for better managing the dimension splitting. Our method is compared with several prevalent evolutionary algorithms as well as state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization works designed for analog circuit sizing problems. The experimental results demonstrate the high efficacy of our proposed sizing methodology.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3102088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9686552/09615495.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3102088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"High-Dimensional Many-Objective Bayesian Optimization for LDE-Aware Analog IC Sizing","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9615495/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615495/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000196","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)"},{"fundingName":"Provincial Government of Newfoundland and Labrador"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005616","fundingName":"Memorial University of Newfoundland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Dimensional Many-Objective Bayesian Optimization for LDE-Aware Analog IC Sizing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liao-3102088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076536S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9686552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9686552","articleId":"9615495","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9615715,"authors":[{"name":"Firuz Kamalov","affiliation":["Canadian University Dubai, Dubai, UAE"],"firstName":"Firuz","lastName":"Kamalov","id":"37086607383"},{"name":"Ashraf Elnagar","affiliation":["University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Ashraf","lastName":"Elnagar","id":"37329505500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0304-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4829-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9615715","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Machine learning algorithms","Estimation","Machine learning","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing","Tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imbalanced data","KDE","neural networks","kernel density estimation","deep learning","sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615715","abstract":"Imbalanced data occurs in a wide range of scenarios. The skewed distribution of the target variable elicits bias in machine learning algorithms. One of the popular methods to combat imbalanced data is to artificially balance the data through resampling. In this paper, we compare the efficacy of a recently proposed kernel density estimation (KDE) sampling technique in the context of artificial neural networks. We benchmark the KDE sampling method against two base sampling techniques and perform comparative experiments using 8 datasets and 3 neural networks architectures. The results show that KDE sampling produces the best performance on 6 out of 8 datasets. However, it must be used with caution on image datasets. We conclude that KDE sampling is capable of significantly improving the performance of neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615715","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615623/9615626/09615715.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel density estimation-based sampling for neural network classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 2 2021","displayDocTitle":"Kernel density estimation-based sampling for neural network classification","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2021","publicationDate":"31 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9615715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615715/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel density estimation-based sampling for neural network classification","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1570706842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111709S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 2 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615623","isNumber":"9615626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615623","xplore-issue":"9615626","articleId":"9615715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9615730,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Soykan","affiliation":["Graduate Education Inst\u0131tute, Computer Engineering, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Soykan","id":"37089163514"},{"name":"P\u0131nar Sar\u0131saray B\u00f6l\u00fck","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Software Engineering, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"P\u0131nar Sar\u0131saray","lastName":"B\u00f6l\u00fck","id":"37945366100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0304-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4829-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9615730","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Machine learning","Telecommunication traffic","Forestry","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TOR","Machine Learning","Artificial Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615730","abstract":"The Internet is a virtual world where everyone can express themselves as much as they wish and perform the operations they want. In this virtual world, some users want to experience the internet without giving their identity for certain reasons. The concept of an anonymous network has emerged so that they can use the internet without revealing their identity. The Tor project is a product that provides anonymous communication on the Internet without revealing users\u2019 identities. In this project, we aimed to determine whether network traffic is the TOR network by using machine learning and artificial neural networks. With the dataset we have, we first performed data analysis and gained more information about the data set. Categorical values were assigned to numerical values to learn the dataset. After converting the categorical data to numerical data, normalization is applied to the data set and all features are taken between -1 and 1. It was estimated whether the future traffic was TOR by learning the past data by using K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes Classifiers, Random Decision Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, one of the machine learning classification algorithms. In addition, artificial neural networks were used. After each algorithm, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score values, which are among the model evaluation tools, were calculated, and compared which model performed better for our dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615730","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615623/9615626/09615730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","publicationTitle":"2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tor Network Detection By Using Machine Learning And Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 2 2021","displayDocTitle":"Tor Network Detection By Using Machine Learning And Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","publicationDate":"31 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9615730/","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tor Network Detection By Using Machine Learning And Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1570701954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062899S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2021-Nov. 2 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615623","isNumber":"9615626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615623","xplore-issue":"9615626","articleId":"9615730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615754,"authors":[{"name":"Jenna Campbell","affiliation":["Freedom Photonics LCC, Santa Barbara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Jenna","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37085709446"},{"name":"Michelle Labrecque","affiliation":["Freedom Photonics LCC, Santa Barbara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Michelle","lastName":"Labrecque","id":"37088739488"},{"name":"Daniel Renner","affiliation":["Freedom Photonics LCC, Santa Barbara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Renner","id":"37378471500"},{"name":"Leif Johannson","affiliation":["Freedom Photonics LCC, Santa Barbara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Johannson","id":"37085971569"},{"name":"Milan Mashanovitch","affiliation":["Freedom Photonics LCC, Santa Barbara, California, USA"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Mashanovitch","id":"37085431254"},{"name":"Paul O.

For this purpose, spectral sharing has been used in this research. This study aims to optimize spectrum sharing as one of the techniques for beamforming through intelligent antennas to reduce interference and achieve precise 5G targets in heterogeneous environments.

With the development of 5G networks, more objectives have been concerned to improve the user experience. The relationship between these multiple objectives is complex or even conflicting, which increases the difficulty of solving the MOO problems. Traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm) have higher computation complexity and require to store multiple models for the preference of different objectives. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective scheduling model based on the Actor-Critic framework is proposed, which can effectively solve the multi-user scheduling problem under Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), and utilize a single model to approximate the Pareto frontier. In the single-cell downlink scheduling scenario, the proposed model is applied to the two objective optimization, i.e., channel capacity and fairness. The simulation results show that the performance of our model is close to the theoretical optimal value in the single-objective case. The Pareto frontier can be uniformly approximated in the multi-objective case, and it has strong robustness to never-seen preference combinations.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615934","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1635","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09615934.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning for Pareto Frontier Approximation: A Case Study of Resource Allocation Network in Massive MIMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615934/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning for Pareto Frontier Approximation: A Case Study of Resource Allocation Network in Massive MIMO","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9615934/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning for Pareto Frontier Approximation: A Case Study of Resource Allocation Network in Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057884S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9615934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615943,"authors":[{"name":"Jabran Akhtar","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Jabran","lastName":"Akhtar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9615943","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Spaceborne radar","Neural networks","Radar detection","Europe","Doppler radar","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar","range-Doppler","constant false alarm rate (CFAR)","discrete Fourier transform","neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615943","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09615943.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmenting Radar Doppler Resolution with Neural Networks","abstract":"In order to generate high-resolution Doppler profiles a radar needs to emit a large number of pulses within a coherent processing interval (CPI). For a radar operating in demanding scenarios it can be difficult to sustain a long CPI across search directions. In this work, an application of small neural networks is proposed to augment the Doppler resolution beyond the one detailed by basic radar parameters. A specific neural network structure is proposed which can be trained to operate on complex valued time-domain data and yield a frequency transformed output with an increased Doppler bin resolution. It is shown that by making use of these techniques a radar can improve its ability to detect targets and to distinguish closely spaced targets. A limited increase in the Doppler bin resolution can be sustained with little to no negative impact on the false alarm rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9615943/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9615943/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Augmenting Radar Doppler Resolution with Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmenting Radar Doppler Resolution with Neural Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040489S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9615943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9615976,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Hellkvist","affiliation":["Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hellkvist","id":"37088481031"},{"name":"Ay\u00e7a \u00d6z\u00e7elikkale","affiliation":["Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ay\u00e7a","lastName":"\u00d6z\u00e7elikkale","id":"37392986200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9615976","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9615976","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear systems","Degradation","Analytical models","Estimation","Europe","Signal processing","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model uncertainty","missing features","robustness"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Mismatch Trade-offs in LMMSE Estimation","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2049","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09615976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9615976","abstract":"We consider a linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimation framework with model mismatch where the assumed model order is smaller than that of the underlying linear system which generates the data used in the estimation process.

In this work, we develop an audio-based toxic language classifier using self-attentive Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As definitions of hostility or toxicity can vary depending on the platform or application, in this work we take a more general approach for identifying toxic utterances, one that does not depend on individual lexicon terms, but rather considers the entire acoustical context of the short verse or utterance. In the proposed architecture, the self-attention mechanism captures the temporal dependency of the verbal content by summarizing all the relevant information from different regions of the utterance. The proposed audio-based self-attentive CNN model is evaluated on a public and an internal dataset and achieves 75% accuracy, 79% precision, and 80 % recall in identifying toxic speech recordings.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616001","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616001.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audio-based Toxic Language Classification using Self-attentive Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Audio-based Toxic Language Classification using Self-attentive Convolutional Neural Network","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9616001/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616001/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audio-based Toxic Language Classification using Self-attentive Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0936S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616002,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Poschadel","affiliation":["Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Poschadel"},{"name":"Stephan Preihs","affiliation":["Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Preihs"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616002","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Recurrent neural networks","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Convolution","Europe","Estimation","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-source direction of arrival estimation","higher-order Ambisonics","convolutional recurrent neural network","spherical harmonics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616002","abstract":"Convolutional recurrent neural networks provide state of the art results in direction of arrival estimation based on first-order Ambisonics signals, especially in the presence of noise and/or interfering sound sources.

To meet the new demands, the fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems features native machine type communication (MTC) services in addition to traditional human type communication (HTC) services. Some of the main challenges are the heterogeneous requirements and the sporadic traffic of massive MTC (mMTC), which makes the orthogonal allocation of resources infeasible. To overcome this problem, grant free non-orthogonal multiple access schemes have been proposed alongside with sparse signal recovery algorithms. While most of the related works have considered only homogeneous networks, we focus on a scenario where an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) device and multiple MTC devices share the same radio resources. We exploit the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for joint device activity detection and channel estimation of MTC devices in the presence of interference from eMBB, and evaluate the system performance in terms of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and channel estimation errors. Moreover, we also propose two new pilot sequence generation strategies which improve the detection capabilities of the MTC receiver without affecting the eMBB service.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616003","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616003.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"840","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Device Activity Detection in Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Device Activity Detection in Heterogeneous Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616003/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616003/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Device Activity Detection in Heterogeneous Networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05576S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616006,"authors":[{"name":"Carmen Sippel","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Ulm University, Germany"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Sippel","id":"37085872900"},{"name":"Robert F.H.

Iterative algorithms in CS alternate between two subproblems, which are given by the structure of the signal and the system of equations, respectively. Hereby, the components of the signal vector are usually updated in parallel. Alternatively, a sequential processing of the components of the signal vector is possible, where the order of processing can be varied and individual variances are utilized. A suitable scheduling can speed up the convergence and thereby reduce the complexity, which is necessary to achieve a certain performance level. In this paper, we introduce a sequential algorithm for CS, discuss a variety of schedules and show by numerical simulations that the number of signal components to be processed in order to attain a specific performance level can be significantly reduced with suitable schedules.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616006","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616006.pdf","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1939","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VAMP with Individual Variances and Sequential Processing for Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"VAMP with Individual Variances and Sequential Processing for Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616006/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616006/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VAMP with Individual Variances and Sequential Processing for Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048065S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616023,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Liebgott","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Liebgott","id":"37077655500"},{"name":"Annika Liebgott","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Annika","lastName":"Liebgott","id":"37085776252"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089181839"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616023","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616023","abstract":"Event-based non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) commonly consists of two separate modules: an event detector, which identifies state changes in the aggregate power signal, and an event classifier, which determines the appliance causing the change.

We propose to use an end-to-end approach for simultaneous event detection and classification by training a convolutional neural network on short-time Fourier transform frames of the aggregate power signal.

They are notable for the ability to include a deterministic component of the system and a stochastic one to represent random unknown factors. However, this makes learning SDEs much more challenging than ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this paper, we propose a data driven approach where parameters of the SDE are represented by a neural network with a built-in SDE integration scheme. The loss function is based on a maximum likelihood criterion, under order one Markov Gaussian assumptions. The algorithm is applied to the geometric brownian motion and a stochastic version of the Lorenz-63 model. The latter is particularly hard to handle due to the presence of a stochastic component that depends on the state. The algorithm performance is attested using different simulations results. Besides, comparisons are performed with the reference gradient matching method used for non linear drift estimation, and a neural networks-based method, that does not consider the stochastic term.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616068/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9616068/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning stochastic dynamical systems with neural networks mimicking the Euler-Maruyama scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning stochastic dynamical systems with neural networks mimicking the Euler-Maruyama scheme","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065956S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9616069,"authors":[{"name":"Jaweria Amjad","affiliation":["University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jaweria","lastName":"Amjad","id":"38666448700"},{"name":"Zhaoyan Lyu","affiliation":["University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Zhaoyan","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37088767428"},{"name":"Miguel R.D.

Experimental results show that our newly proposed regularization techniques can deliver state-of-the-art performance in comparison to established weight-based regularization.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616069","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616069.pdf","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1485","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regression with Deep Neural Networks: Generalization Error Guarantees, Learning Algorithms, and Regularizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Regression with Deep Neural Networks: Generalization Error Guarantees, Learning Algorithms, and Regularizers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616069/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regression with Deep Neural Networks: Generalization Error Guarantees, Learning Algorithms, and Regularizers","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128535S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9616138,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bohlender","affiliation":["IDLab, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bohlender"},{"name":"Ann Spriet","affiliation":["Goodix Technology (Belgium) B.V.,Leuven,Belgium"],"firstName":"Ann","lastName":"Spriet"},{"name":"Wouter Tirry","affiliation":["Goodix Technology (Belgium) B.V.,Leuven,Belgium"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Tirry"},{"name":"Nilesh Madhu","affiliation":["IDLab, Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nilesh","lastName":"Madhu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616138","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Measurement","Time-frequency analysis","Source separation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Array signal processing","Spatial diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["source separation","speech enhancement","time-frequency masking","neural networks","direction-of-arrival"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616138","abstract":"With a microphone array, spatial diversity can be exploited to estimate time-frequency masks that effectively suppress interfering speakers as well as noise.

To capture the target signal spectrogram more accurately, the estimation can be performed for each subband separately. In order to also take advantage of cross-band dependencies, we additionally consider a combined subband and full-band architecture. Our evaluation indicates that this combination consistently improves the performance in terms of instrumental quality metrics as compared to a pure subband or full-band method.

The main contribution of this paper is the optimization of this problem for continuous phase modulated signals, which present relevant properties for a dual radar-communications system. It is shown that the optimization problem is convex, thus it provides an optimal solution. The performance of the proposed filter in terms of mean Integrated Sidelobe Level is then compared to the classical matched filter, as well as to the usual on-grid mismatched filter, through simulations.

Although the linear model-based method has been widely used in AAD, the linear assumption was considered oversimplified and the decoding accuracy remained lower for shorter decoding windows. Recently, nonlinear models based on deep neural networks (DNN) have been proposed to solve this problem. However, these models did not fully utilize both the spatial and temporal features of EEG, and the interpretability of DNN models was rarely investigated. In this paper, we proposed novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) based regression model and classification model, and compared them with both the linear model and the state-of-the-art DNN models. Results showed that, our proposed CRNN-based classification model outperformed others for shorter decoding windows (around 90% for 2 s and 5 s). Although worse than classification models, the decoding accuracy of the proposed CRNN - based regression model was about 5% greater than other regression models. The interpretability of DNN models was also investigated by visualizing layers' weight.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616195","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616195.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"974","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auditory Attention Decoding from EEG using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Auditory Attention Decoding from EEG using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616195/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771023,12074012,U1713217"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auditory Attention Decoding from EEG using Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077382S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9616204,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Poschadel","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Poschadel"},{"name":"Robert Hupke","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hupke"},{"name":"Stephan Preihs","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Preihs"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Location awareness","Recurrent neural networks","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Convolution","Europe","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","higher-order Ambisonics","convolutional recurrent neural network","spherical harmonics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616204","abstract":"Training convolutional recurrent neural networks on first-order Ambisonics signals is a well-known approach when estimating the direction of arrival for speech/sound signals.

NARX systems can be seen as a nonlinear version of linear infinite impulse response filter. Data-driven approaches are witnessing considerable interests in recent times and they are well-flourished for linear time-invariant systems. However, for nonlinear systems, they are still limited and attempts have been made to generalize the results for linear systems to nonlinear systems. In this paper, we study the problem of data-driven simulation for NARX systems: compute the output trajectory from a given input trajectory and initial conditions without explicitly identifying the parametric model; the model is implicitly identified by observed trajectory. Next, we develop an algorithm for the implementation of our approach. Finally, we illustrate the developed algorithm by numerical experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear systems","Computational modeling","Signal processing algorithms","IIR filters","Signal processing","Trajectory","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data-driven simulation","NARX","System identification"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616226","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616226.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Simulation for NARX Systems*","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Simulation for NARX Systems*","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616226/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616226/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Simulation for NARX Systems*","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069453S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616238,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e9ment Dorffer","affiliation":["Lab-STICC & ENSTA-Bretagne, UMR CNRS,Brest,France,6285"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9ment","lastName":"Dorffer","id":"37085770006"},{"name":"Thomas Paviet-Salomon","affiliation":["Lab-STICC & ENSTA-Bretagne, UMR CNRS,Brest,France,6285"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Paviet-Salomon","id":"37088481973"},{"name":"Gilles Le Chenadec","affiliation":["Lab-STICC & ENSTA-Bretagne, UMR CNRS,Brest,France,6285"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Le Chenadec","id":"37563308200"},{"name":"Ang\u00e9lique Dr\u00e9meau","affiliation":["Lab-STICC & ENSTA-Bretagne, UMR CNRS,Brest,France,6285"],"firstName":"Ang\u00e9lique","lastName":"Dr\u00e9meau","id":"37601444500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616238","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Signal processing algorithms","Europe","Estimation","Approximation algorithms","Bayes methods","Underwater acoustics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater modal estimation","structured sparse approximation","Restricted Boltzmann Machine","Bayesian algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616238","abstract":"In underwater acoustics, shallow water environments act as modal dispersive waveguides when considering lowfrequency sources. In this context, propagating signals can be described as a sum of few modal components, each of them propagating according to its own wavenumber. Estimating these wavenumbers is of key interest to understand the propagating environment as well as the emitting source. To solve this problem, we proposed recently a Bayesian approach exploiting a sparsity-inforcing prior. When dealing with broadband sources, this model can be further improved by integrating the particular dependence linking the wavenumbers from one frequency to the other. In this contribution, we propose to resort to a new approach relying on a restricted Boltzmann machine, exploited as a generic structured sparsity-inforcing model. This model, derived from deep Bayesian networks, can indeed be efficiently learned on physically realistic simulated data using well-known and proven algorithms.","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616238","startPage":"286","endPage":"290","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modal estimation in underwater acoustics by data-driven structured sparse decompositions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Modal estimation in underwater acoustics by data-driven structured sparse decompositions","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9616238/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616238/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006021","fundingName":"DGA Naval Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modal estimation in underwater acoustics by data-driven structured sparse decompositions","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074819S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616248,"authors":[{"name":"Andong Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Andong","lastName":"Li","id":"37088636135"},{"name":"Chengshi Zheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengshi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37402253800"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086381148"},{"name":"Xiaodong Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Research, Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Li","id":"37539489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616248","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Adaptation models","System performance","Europe","Estimation","Speech enhancement","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech enhancement","early exit","progressive learning","complex spectral mapping","stage recurrent mechanism"]}],"abstract":"In real scenarios, it is often necessary and significant to control the inference speed of speech enhancement systems under different conditions. To this end, we propose a stage-wise adaptive inference approach with early exit mechanism for progressive speech enhancement. Specifically, in each stage, once the spectral distance between adjacent stages lowers the empirically preset threshold, the inference will terminate and output the estimation, which can effectively accelerate the inference speed. To further improve the performance of existing speech enhancement systems, PL-CRN++ is proposed, which is an improved version over our preliminary work PL-CRN and combines stage recurrent mechanism and complex spectral mapping. Extensive experiments are conducted on the TIMIT corpus, the results demonstrate the superiority of our system over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of PESQ, ESTOI and DNSMOS. Moreover, by adjusting the threshold, we can easily control the inference efficiency while sustaining the system performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616248","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616248.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"470","doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Inference with Early Exit in the Progressive Speech Enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Inference with Early Exit in the Progressive Speech Enhancement","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616248/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616248/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Inference with Early Exit in the Progressive Speech Enhancement","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093577S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616321,"authors":[{"name":"Stanis\u0142aw Kacprzak","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology Institute of Electronics, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Stanis\u0142aw","lastName":"Kacprzak","id":"37086000546"},{"name":"Konrad Kowalczyk","affiliation":["AGH University of Science and Technology Institute of Electronics, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"Kowalczyk","id":"37411428500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616321","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"abstract":"In classification tasks, the classification accuracy diminishes when the data is gathered in different domains. To address this problem, in this paper, we investigate several adversarial models for domain adaptation (DA) and their effect on the acoustic scene classification task. The studied models include several types of generative adversarial networks (GAN), with different loss functions, and the so-called cycle GAN which consists of two interconnected GAN models. The experiments are performed on the DCASE20 challenge task 1A dataset, in which we can leverage the paired examples of data recorded using different devices, i.e., the source and target domain recordings. The results of performed experiments indicate that the best performing domain adaptation can be obtained using the cycle GAN, which achieves as much as 66% relative improvement in accuracy for the target domain device, while only 6 % relative decrease in accuracy on the source domain. In addition, by utilizing the paired data examples, we are able to improve the overall accuracy over the model trained using larger unpaired data set, while decreasing the computational cost of the model training.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Training","Adaptation models","Image analysis","Computational modeling","Signal processing","Generative adversarial networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["domain adaptation","acoustic scene classification","GAN","cycle GAN","paired data","loss functions"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616321","publicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9615915/9615917/09616321.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9615917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Paired Examples for Acoustic Scene Classification on Different Recording Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Paired Examples for Acoustic Scene Classification on Different Recording Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616321/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616321/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004281","fundingName":"National Science Centre","grantNumber":"DEC-2017/25/B/ST7/01792"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Paired Examples for Acoustic Scene Classification on Different Recording Devices","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0001030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06782S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":9616329,"authors":[{"name":"Juul Van Boxtel","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Juul","lastName":"Van Boxtel","id":"37089179148"},{"name":"Vincent Vousten","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Vousten","id":"37089181606"},{"name":"Josien Pluim","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Josien","lastName":"Pluim","id":"37276226000"},{"name":"Nastaran Mohammadian Rad","affiliation":["Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nastaran Mohammadian","lastName":"Rad","id":"37086089308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0827-9706-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2219-5491"}],"articleNumber":"9616329","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616329","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image segmentation","Ultrasonic imaging","Pain","Surgery","Europe","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["medical imaging","brachial plexus","deep learning","convolutional neural network","segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) can replace general anesthesia (GA), improving pain control and recovery time.

To address this problem, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more advanced deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used for identification and segmentation of the BP nerve region. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model consisting of a classification model followed by a segmentation model to segment BP nerve regions in ultrasound images. A CNN model is employed as a classifier to precisely select the images with the BP region. Then, a U-net or M-net model is used for the segmentation.

This gives us an accurate, light and fast vision based localization framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616354/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9616354/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"YOLOv5 Based Visual Localization For Autonomous Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"YOLOv5 Based Visual Localization For Autonomous Vehicles","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"0000746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084452S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9615915","isNumber":"9615917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9615915","xplore-issue":"9615917","articleId":"9616354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9616364,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-0973-8058"},{"name":"Xianzhuo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xianzhuo","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Bangjiang Lin","affiliation":["Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Quanzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bangjiang","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0003-3553-2536"},{"name":"Pengcheng Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Deng"},{"name":"Anlin Yi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Anlin","lastName":"Yi","orcid":"0000-0002-7495-9885"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"9616364","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"IEEE Plagiarism Policy","type":"graphic","fileSize":"","file":"/ielx7/4563994/9614351/9616364/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3128420.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/9614351/9616364/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3128420.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical network units","Passive optical networks","Optical distortion","Codes","Nonlinear distortion","Fiber nonlinear optics","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive optical network","non-orthogonal multiple access","sparse code multiple access","graph neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616364","abstract":"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising technology to provide high throughput and overall improved system performance at affordable cost for next-generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs). Message passing algorithm (MPA) based on a factor graph is usually used for low-complexity multi-user detection in SCMA. However, MPA requires accurate and effective channel estimation due to the interference between the user's signals on the same resource block and suffers uncertain convergence caused by the cycles in the factor graph. In this paper, a graph neural networks (GNN)-based detection method is proposed for SCMA-PON, which performs channel impairment compensation and signal detection in a joint manner. 25.5 Gb/s SCMA-OFDM system over 20/60 km single mode fiber link is simulated to demonstrate the feasibility with 8.5-G class optical devices. The simulation results show that GNN-based detection method outperforms MPA and is more robust to the nonlinear distortion for the same level of computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3128420","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/9614351/09616364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3128420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9614351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Next-Generation Passive Optical Network Based on Sparse Code Multiple Access and Graph Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Next-Generation Passive Optical Network Based on Sparse Code Multiple Access and Graph Neural Networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2022","externalId":"8602706","htmlLink":"/document/9616364/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB2201103"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Science and Technology Program, China","grantNumber":"2020YFSY0021"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Next-Generation Passive Optical Network Based on Sparse Code Multiple Access and Graph Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jphot-lin-3128420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059286S","chronDate":"Feb.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"9614351","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","xplore-issue":"9614351","articleId":"9616364","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9616375,"authors":[{"name":"Jiale Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiale","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Enqing Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Enqing","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-1261-1282"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9616375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method For Multimodal Data Fusion in Action Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reinforcement learning","Resource management","Data models","Signal processing algorithms","Task analysis","Neural networks","Decision making"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimodal action recognition","TD3","fusion weight allocation","deep reinforcement learning"]}],"abstract":"At present, in the research of multimodal human action recognition, the weighted fusion method with fixed weight is widely applied in the decision level fusion of most models.

However, there are still two issues that need to be ameliorated. First, the prevailing linguistic steganalysis methods rely heavily on massive training data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Second, these methods implement steganalysis only in different weak-concealed scenarios, the stego texts in each of which have only a single language style and payload. But in practice, the intercepted network samples are probably the mixture of the stego texts that possess different language styles and payloads, in which the semantic spatial distribution may be more chaotic than that in weak-concealed scenarios, thus making steganalysis more difficult. To address the above issues, a novel linguistic steganalysis method is proposed in this letter. First, the pre-trained BERT language model is constructed as an embedder to compensate for the shortage of data. Then, in addition to learning local and global semantic features, a feature interaction module is designed for exploring mutual effects between them. Furthermore, besides the typical cross-entropy loss, triplet loss is also introduced for the model training. In this way, the proposed method can refine more comprehensive and discriminative deep features in the intricate semantic space. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the representative linguistic steganalysis methods on datasets of different scales, and the experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3128372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3128372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","startPage":"130","endPage":"134","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09616404.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Linguistics","Semantics","Training","Payloads","Steganography","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linguistic steganalysis","neural networks","small-scale concealed scenarios","feature interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Small-Scale Linguistic Steganalysis for Multi-Concealed Scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9616404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616404/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Scale Linguistic Steganalysis for Multi-Concealed Scenarios","sourcePdf":"lsp-zhong-3128372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087775S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9616404","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9616415,"authors":[{"name":"Wenliang Guo","affiliation":["Xidian University, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Wenliang","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0002-1418-4117"},{"name":"Xiao Xiao","affiliation":["Xidian University, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Yilong Hui","affiliation":["Xidian University, School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yilong","lastName":"Hui","orcid":"0000-0001-5543-2669"},{"name":"Wenming Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Science and Technology International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wenming","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-2506-1286"},{"name":"Amir Sadovnik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Sadovnik"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9616415","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Feature extraction","Convolution","Image segmentation","Semantics","Testing","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blur detection","convolution neural network","heterogeneous design","nested structure","semantic information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Attention Nested U-Shaped Network for Blur Detection","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3128375","startPage":"140","endPage":"144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09616415.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3128375","abstract":"With the popularity of image sensors in various mobile devices, image blurring caused by hand shaking or out of focus becomes ubiquitous, which deteriorates image quality and poses challenges for vision tasks, including object detection, image classification and image segmentation.

In this letter, we design an end-to-end convolution neural network called heterogeneous attention nested U-shaped network (HANUN) for blur detection. We introduce pyramid pooling into encoders to enhance the feature extraction at different scales and reduce the gradual information loss. Inspired by the nested network design, small U-shaped networks are embedded into our decoders to increase the network depth and promote feature fusion with different receptive field scales. In addition, we incorporate a channel attention mechanism in the proposed network to highlight the informative features for detecting the blurry regions.

This paper proposes a novel array orientation adjustment method to achieve optimal DPD performance, in which we seek optimal array orientations that maximize the trace of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and then minimize localization uncertainty. The optimization problem is unconstrained, multivariable, and can be converted into multiple tractable single-variable optimization problems. An exact solution can be obtained by a straightforward but computationally tedious one-dimensional exhaustive search. To reduce the computational load, we then derive an asymptotic solution in cases where the arrays consist of massive antennas. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method in resolution and precision enhancement, especially in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3128378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09616437.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3128378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Array Orientation Adjustments Subject to Optimal Direct Position Determination Performance","volume":"29","htmlLink":"/document/9616437/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616437/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Project","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807602 and 2020YFB1807604"},{"fundingName":"China NSF","grantNumber":"61971217, 61971218, 61631020 and 61601167"},{"fundingName":"Sonar technology key laboratory"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Research Funds","grantNumber":"2020Z013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M681585"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array Orientation Adjustments Subject to Optimal Direct Position Determination Performance","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-3128378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057225S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9616437","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9616439,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiao Xiang","affiliation":["Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Xiang","orcid":"0000-0002-5799-5091"},{"name":"Xiaojuan Zhang","affiliation":["Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1543-0025"},{"name":"Haozhe Chen","affiliation":["Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haozhe","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9616439","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nested U-Net With Self-Attention and Dense Connectivity for Monaural Speech Enhancement","abstract":"With the development of deep neural networks, speech enhancement technology has been vastly improved. However, commonly used speech enhancement approaches cannot fully leverage contextual information from different scales, which limits performance improvement. To address this problem, we propose a nested U-Net with self-attention and dense connectivity (SADNUNet) for monaural speech enhancement in the time domain. SADNUNet is an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. In SADNUNet, the multi-scale aggregation block is proposed to explore more contextual information from different scales. By this means, the advantage of global and local speech features can be fully utilized to improve speech reconstruction ability. Furthermore, dense connectivity and self-attention are incorporated in the network for better feature extraction and utterance level context aggregation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves on-par or better performance than other models in objective speech intelligibility and quality scores.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3128374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3128374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686799","startPage":"105","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9686799/09616439.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9616439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Speech enhancement","Feature extraction","Decoding","Time-domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech enhancement","multi-scale aggregation block","self-attention","dense connectivity","time-domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Nested U-Net With Self-Attention and Dense Connectivity for Monaural Speech Enhancement","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","publicationDate":"2022","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9616439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616439/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nested U-Net With Self-Attention and Dense Connectivity for Monaural Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"lsp-xiang-3128374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085155S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9686799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9686799","articleId":"9616439","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":9616444,"authors":[{"name":"Shunyi Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry (Ministry of Education), Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9616444/zhao-3127677-small.gif","p":["Shunyi Zhao (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and application from the Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry (Ministry of Education), Institute of Automation, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, in 2015.

Unique visitors are visitors who use one IP in a certain period. With an increasing number of unique visitors every day, it can be inferred that scientific periodicals are increasingly in demand by the wider community, affecting the breadth of distribution and speeding up the journal accreditation system. Therefore, a model that can predict the number of unique visitors in electronic journals in the future can be beneficial for journal administrators. This paper evaluates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) performance when predicting the next day\u2019s (T+1) time series for the number of unique visitors to an e-Journal website. The unique visitor data sample used was from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. The distribution of data testing and training used was 80% and 20%. The data quality has been improved by smoothing the input data using exponential, mean, and median smoothing. The evaluation results show that the architecture with the best performance is model 2, namely the model mean + LSTM architecture 1-5-1 with a learning rate of 0.2 and a MAPE value of 0.08098. Therefore, we conclude that data smoothing with mean smoothing can improve Long Short-Term Memory performance for unique website visitor forecasting.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEIE52663.2021.9616628","startPage":"609","endPage":"613","publicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Information Engineering (ICEEIE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEIE52663.2021.9616628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9616619","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Information Engineering (ICEEIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9616616/9616619/09616628.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting e-Journal Unique Visitors using Smoothed Long Short-Term Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616628/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forecasting e-Journal Unique Visitors using Smoothed Long Short-Term Memory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9616628/","publicationDate":"2 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting e-Journal Unique Visitors using Smoothed Long Short-Term Memory","confLoc":"Malang, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"12_1570753393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074054S","chronDate":"2-2 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9616616","isNumber":"9616619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9616616","xplore-issue":"9616619","articleId":"9616628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9616644,"authors":[{"name":"Rupesh Sharma","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering, PAHER University, Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Rupesh","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37089175633"},{"name":"Prashant Sharma","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering, PAHER University, Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37089172792"},{"name":"Naresh Purohit","affiliation":["Computer Science Engineering, Govt.

While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT52121.2021.9616779","pdfPath":"/iel7/9616617/9616621/09616779.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Fourth International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","publicationTitle":"2021 Fourth International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT52121.2021.9616779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9616621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial (or) Fake Human Face Generator using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Machine Learning Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9616779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Artificial (or) Fake Human Face Generator using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Machine Learning Model","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","publicationDate":"15 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9616779/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial (or) Fake Human Face Generator using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Machine Learning Model","confLoc":"Erode, India","sourcePdf":"EC3074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067161S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9616617","isNumber":"9616621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9616617","xplore-issue":"9616621","articleId":"9616779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9616804,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In near future, self-driving vehicles will be frequently tested in urban traffic and will be able to coexist with human- driven vehicles. When an automated vehicle is employed in highway traffic, it has the need to understand the positions of its surrounding vehicles which share the same environment. It should have the ability to identify the lane in which the surrounding vehicles are moving.

In the early stage, examination by an experienced dermatologist will reliably identify malignant skin tumors; however, extensive screening by dermatologists is not feasible for each single patient. Many studies have been undergone to improve dermatologist-level, computer-aided diagnostics are underway to overcome this challenge. After the advent of deep-learning technology, the detection mechanism has become significant in the medical field. This paper intends to suggest a new paradigm for the diagnosis of melanoma, which comprises of four main stages. (i) pre-processing (ii) segmentation (iii) extraction of features and (iv) classification. Pre-processing is mainly carried out, where the input image is susceptible to smoothening and resizing of the edges. Segmentation is subsequently performed through the Otsu thresholding mechanism. The GLCM features along with the Higher Order Uniform Moment Induced- Local Binary Patterns (HOSMI-LBP) features are extracted. The combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Neural Network (NN) architectures is used to define the classification of melanoma as either benign or malignant. Two steps of classification is followed in this research work: NN is trained with the derived features; parallely, the input image is categorized explicitly using the optimized CNN framework. Finally, the optimized CNN and NN graded outputs will be averaged and the final result is considered to be the detected output. In specific, the weight and initial rate of CNN is optimized using the Sea Lion Integrated Grey Wolf Algorithm (SLI-GWO) method.

Thus, LQR control is implemented, so that the interaction between the main rotor control and the tail rotor can be designed accordingly.

These abnormalities need to be detected at the early stages before they turn malignant. The classification of these abnormalities has put many challenges due to the variations in lesion shape and color, lighting conditions, and other factors. Existing methods based on handcrafted features give less accuracy due to the limited capability of feature representation. This study proposes a new approach for classifying wireless capsule endoscopy images using feature concatenation of deep convolutional neural network models. The features of two pre-trained models are concatenated and tested using a newly created dataset. The dataset is created using images taken from the Kvasir capsule endoscopy and Red lesion endoscopy dataset which is publicly available.

A home energy management system (HEMS) is projected to enable DR applications for residential consumers by monitoring, managing, and controlling their energy consumption. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based HEMS that reallocates and shifts appliances away from peak consumption periods and high electricity prices in order to minimize the electricity bill and the peak to average ratio (PAR). The HEMS receives electricity prices, which are based on real-time pricing (RTP) scheme, from a smart meter and finds the schedule that minimizes the cost and PAR. Our proposed model categorizes appliances into three categories: 1- shiftable interruptible appliances and 2- shift-able uninterruptible appliances and finally 3- fixed base appliances. A new formulation of the problem, which neglects redundant information and considerably reduces the search space, was developed and tested. The results show a substantial improvement in the scheduling problem compared to the conventional formulation reported in literature. The proposed system was able to effectively reduce the cost by 8.7% and PAR by 29%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617067/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9617067/","publicationDate":"9 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Real-Time Pricing-Based Scheduling in Home Energy Management System Using Genetic Algorithms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004055","fundingName":"King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Real-Time Pricing-Based Scheduling in Home Energy Management System Using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IEEE_52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051451S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9616984","isNumber":"9616973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9616984","xplore-issue":"9616973","articleId":"9617067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9617182,"authors":[{"name":"Rizal Broer Bahaweres","affiliation":["Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rizal Broer","lastName":"Bahaweres","id":"38549994900"},{"name":"Detia Jumral","affiliation":["Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Detia","lastName":"Jumral","id":"37089159909"},{"name":"Irman Hermadi","affiliation":["IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Irman","lastName":"Hermadi","id":"37845937900"},{"name":"Arif Imam Suroso","affiliation":["IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arif Imam","lastName":"Suroso","id":"37085785124"},{"name":"Yandra Arkeman","affiliation":["IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Yandra","lastName":"Arkeman","id":"37085788253"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4992-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4991-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4993-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9617182","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Java","Codes","Software metrics","Semantics","Focusing","Syntactics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Defect Prediction","Word Embedding","Long Short-Term Memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9617182","abstract":"Defects often occur in software so it can cause various problems for users.

The diversity of types of ornamental betta fish makes it difficult for ordinary people to recognize the types of ornamental betta fish. Therefore, a classification system for ornamental betta fish is needed which aims to help identify types of ornamental betta fish. In this study, we employ the ResNet-50 architecture for ornamental betta fish classification. The architecture maximizes the resulting accuracy due to a large number of layers. It can reduce the missing gradient problem thereby increasing the resulting performance. The models were trained by using a dataset with several variations of color space to be able to find out the right color space to apply. The color space is quite influential on the model's performance because the color is one of the reliable features in this study. The experiment demonstrates that the RGB color space and Adam optimization algorithm are suitable compositions for the classification of ornamental betta fish species with this dataset. Models using datasets with RGB color space achieve the highest performance with the values of accuracy, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate, and f'1-score are 80%, 82%, 96%, 79%, 96%, and 80%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617213/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9617213/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Ornamental Betta Fish Using Convolutional Neural Network Method and Grabcut Segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Ornamental Betta Fish Using Convolutional Neural Network Method and Grabcut Segmentation","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570743900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102576S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9617228","isNumber":"9617210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9617228","xplore-issue":"9617210","articleId":"9617213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9617311,"authors":[{"name":"Xuenong Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xuenong","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086610209"},{"name":"Tong Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37577248600"},{"name":"Yiqiong Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yiqiong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37535280500"},{"name":"Bah Hwee Gwee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bah Hwee","lastName":"Gwee","id":"37271115600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3988-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3989-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1946-1542"}],"articleNumber":"9617311","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Failure analysis","Machine learning","Predictive models","Hardware","Graph neural networks","Trojan horses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware assurance","netlist recognition","graph neural network","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9617311","abstract":"Circuit netlist recognition is an important step in the analysis flow of hardware assurance.

Our motivation is twofold. First, before the distinguishability of a practical cipher from an ideal one can be analysed, the cryptanalyst must have an accurate understanding of the statistical behaviour of the ideal cipher. Secondly, this issue has been neglected both in old and in more recent studies, particularly when multiple linear approximations are being used simultaneously. Traditional models have been based on the average behaviour and simplified using other assumptions such as independence of the linear approximations. Multidimensional cryptanalysis was introduced to avoid making artificial assumptions about statistical independence of linear approximations. On the other hand, it has the drawback of including many trivial approximations that do not contribute to the attack but just cause a waste of time and memory. We show for the first time in this paper that the trivial approximations reduce the degree of freedom of the related \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\chi ^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n distribution. Previously, the affine linear cryptanalysis was proposed to allow removing trivial approximations and, at the same time, admitting a solid statistical model. In this paper, we identify another type of multidimensional linear approximation, called Davies-Meyer approximation, which has similar advantages, and present full statistical models for both the affine and the Davies-Meyer type of multidimensional linear approximations.

By designing the smallest possible size device, this device can be used even during activities. Users can easily monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (BPM) on the Android application. For data transmission, the device is supported by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) so that the battery used can last longer. With the MAX30100 sensor as a pulse oximeter sensor and nRF52832 as a microprocessor as well as a communication module, the device has been successfully made with dimensions of 5.3 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm that can be used in the user's hand. All SpO2 and BPM detection data were successfully sent to Android via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The device succeeded in detecting the index finger with an average accuracy of Sp02 and BPM of 99.59% and 97.14%, and succeeded in detecting under normal conditions, after waking up and exercising with the largest average Sp02 accuracy of 99.72 % and BPM 98.34 %. Analysis using ANN on Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 succeeded in reducing detections spikes with an average accuracy of 86.45%. And the device can work at low power (low energy) ie 78.53 mW -107.95 mW with a battery life of 8 hours 33 minutes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617472/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9617472/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Wearable Pulse Oximeter Based on Android with Bluetooth Low Energy Communication Using Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Wearable Pulse Oximeter Based on Android with Bluetooth Low Energy Communication Using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Bandung, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570755064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065942S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9617228","isNumber":"9617210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9617228","xplore-issue":"9617210","articleId":"9617472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9617593,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Carapezzi","affiliation":["LIRMM, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9617593/carap-3128756-small.gif","p":["Stefania Carapezzi received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.

Critical safety checks involve detecting various anomalies such as imbalanced payload, damaged propellers, mulfunctioning motors and poorly calibrated compass, etc. Human efforts are currently required for performing such tasks, which impedes large-scale deployments of drones and increases the operational costs. In this work, we propose a weight-measuring landing platform along with a set of statistical inference algorithms aimed at performing safety checks for any multicopter aircraft that lands on the platform. We develop a nonconvex nonlinear least squares model for estimating the center of gravity and orientation of the aircraft, and derive a recursive formula for calculating the optimal solution. In numeric experiments, our analytical solution method has been able to find the global solution orders-of-magnitude faster than a global optimization solver. We have conducted real-system tests on a quadcopter drone deliberately configured to carry misplaced payload, and to use damaged propellers. Experiment results show that the platform is able to detect and profile these common safety issues with high accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09617601.pdf","startPage":"154876","endPage":"154891","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Smart Landing Platform With Data-Driven Analytic Procedures for UAV Preflight Safety Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Smart Landing Platform With Data-Driven Analytic Procedures for UAV Preflight Safety Diagnosis","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9617601/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1944068"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Smart Landing Platform With Data-Driven Analytic Procedures for UAV Preflight Safety Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"access-liu-3128866-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163721S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9617601","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9617609,"authors":[{"name":"Yakub Kayode Saheed","affiliation":["School of IT and Computing, American University of Nigeria, Yola, Nigeria","Kaptain A.

As a result of these improvements, numerous new channels of communication are being created, one of which is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has recently emerged as cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the IoT, in which medical equipment exchange information with each other to exchange sensitive information. These developments enable the healthcare business to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is seen as a significant challenge in whatsoever technology\u2019s reliance based on the IoT. Security difficulties occur owing to the various potential attacks posed by attackers. There are numerous security concerns, such as remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle. In the event of such attacks, critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authorized users. As a result, it turns out to be critical to safeguard the IoT/IoMT ecosystem against malware assaults. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) can be utilized to develop an efficient and effective IDS in the IoMT environment for classifying and forecasting unexpected cyber threats. Preprocessing and normalization of network data are performed. Following that, we optimized features using a bio-inspired particle swarm algorithm. On the standard data for intrusion detection, a thorough evaluation of experiments in DRNN and other SML is performed. It was established through rigorous testing that the proposed SML model outperforms existing approaches with an accuracy of 99.76%.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128837","startPage":"161546","endPage":"161554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09617609.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Cyber Attack Detection on the Internet of Medical Things-Smart Environment Based on Deep Recurrent Neural Network and Machine Learning Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Security","Internet of Things","Hospitals","Wireless sensor networks","Robot sensing systems","Privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Medical Things","cyber-attack","Internet of Things","particle swarm optimization","recurrent neural network","smart environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Cyber Attack Detection on the Internet of Medical Things-Smart Environment Based on Deep Recurrent Neural Network and Machine Learning Algorithms","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9617609/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State, Nigeria"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Cyber Attack Detection on the Internet of Medical Things-Smart Environment Based on Deep Recurrent Neural Network and Machine Learning Algorithms","sourcePdf":"access-saheed-3128837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104603S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9617609","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9617630,"authors":[{"name":"Bekhzod Olimov","affiliation":["Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9617630/olimo-3128607-small.gif","p":["Bekhzod Olimov received the B.S. degree in economics from the Fergana Polytechnic Institute, Uzbekistan, in 2014, and the M.S. degree from Yeungnam University, South Korea, in 2018.

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a better accuracy in several evaluation metrics compared with the existing lightweight and efficient methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128607","startPage":"154194","endPage":"154203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09617630.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Biomedical imaging","Computational modeling","Convolutional neural networks","Computer architecture","Task analysis","Convolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational efficiency","deep convolutional neural networks","medical image segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9617630/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2021R1I1A3043970"},{"fundingName":"BK21 FOUR Project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002531","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, South Korea","grantNumber":"4199990214394"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"access-kim-3128607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102363S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9617630","onlineDate":"16 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9617636,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeev Tannirkulam Chandrasekaran","affiliation":["University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/9647029/9617636/chand-3128587-small.gif","p":["Sanjeev Tannirkulam Chandrasekaran (Member, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and instrumentation from SASTRA University, Thanjavur, India, in 2016.

Accelerator Quick Error Detection (A-QED) is a recent formal technique which uses Bounded Model Checking for pre-silicon verification of HAs. A-QED checks an HA for self-consistency, i.e., whether identical inputs within a sequence of operations always produce the same output. Under modest assumptions, A-QED is both sound and complete. However, as is well-known, large design sizes significantly limit the scalability of formal verification, including A-QED. We overcome this scalability challenge through a new decomposition technique for A-QED, called A-QED with Decomposition $(A-Q E D^{2})$.

Edge caching of data can reduce the number of packet transmissions in the constrained network, but it can also lead to staleness of information whose content changes over time; so, the cached data must be refreshed timely. The update of the cached data introduces additional transmissions that can degrade the performance because of the constrained underlying technology. Therefore, a refreshing cache scheme should minimize the number of transmissions while guaranteeing freshness of the data collected at the network edge. Freshness of information can be quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metrics. In this work we propose a model-driven cache management scheme implemented by a cache-enabled edge proxy that reduces the number of exchanged messages while meeting AoI requirements. Several simulations are then conducted to validate the proposed model and evaluate the performance of the cache management scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9617772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9617772/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","publicationDate":"Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Model-Driven Approach to Aol-Based Cache Management in IoT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Driven Approach to Aol-Based Cache Management in IoT","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2021005987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067245S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9617743","isNumber":"9617763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9617743","xplore-issue":"9617763","articleId":"9617772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":9617973,"authors":[{"name":"Yikang Zhang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yikang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086585546"},{"name":"Gang Li","firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Li","id":"37089168545"},{"name":"Hongmin Li","firstName":"Hongmin","lastName":"Li","id":"37089166305"},{"name":"Wen Qiao","firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37086584020"},{"name":"Jingzhou Pang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Jingzhou","lastName":"Pang","id":"37089167640"},{"name":"Falin Liu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Falin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37419353400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3437-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3438-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9617973","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9617973","abstract":"In this paper, a novel simplified vector decomposed time-dealy neural network (SVDTDNN) model is proposed for digital predistortion (DPD) of radiao-frequency (RF) power amplifiers (FAs).

The six-port circuit consist of 1 direct coupler, 3 hybrid couplers and 2 Wilkinson power dividers. By optimizing the length of the microstrip lines, the phase condition is satisfied based on the evenly distributed circle centers of six-port feature parameters. The best operating bandwidth of the proposed six-port junction prototype is from 2.5 to 2.8 GHz. Then, the experimental system is built which utilizes a nonlinear iterative calibration with 4 calibrated elements and an error box algorithm to calibrate the six-port circuit. By using the calibration model, the reflective coefficients of the microfluidic sensing resonator are calculated by a nonlinear iterative algorithm with linear solution as the initial value. The average measurement errors of the obtained magnitude and the phase are 0.051 and 23.807\u00b0. Its resonant frequency can be calculated accurately, which determined the microfluidic solution concentration. The accuracy of the proposed structure provides a low-cost portable method for microfluidic measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT52847.2021.9618015","pdfPath":"/iel7/9617816/9617818/09618015.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT52847.2021.9618015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9617818","endPage":"3","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Frequency Compensated Six-Port Junction and its Application in Microfluidic Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618015/","displayDocTitle":"Design of Frequency Compensated Six-Port Junction and its Application in Microfluidic Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9618015/","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 2021","publicationDate":"23 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Frequency Compensated Six-Port Junction and its Application in Microfluidic Sensing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"M25_14_2_TP2I_04_299_4_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041489S","chronDate":"23-26 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9617816","isNumber":"9617818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9617816","xplore-issue":"9617818","articleId":"9618015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":9618066,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Jian Chen","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086855058"},{"name":"Yu Zou","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zou","id":"37089174984"},{"name":"Jun-Kai Lai","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Kai","lastName":"Lai","id":"37089165569"},{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37089169465"},{"name":"Xiao-Ling Lin","affiliation":["Electronic Product Reliability and Environmental Testing Research Institute, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ling","lastName":"Lin","id":"37089166489"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3437-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3438-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9618066","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Noise figure","Microwave integrated circuits","Millimeter wave technology","Voltage","Microwave circuits","Silicon"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low-noise amplifier","Gallium Nitride","noise figure","gain flatness","high-pass network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618066","abstract":"An 18-30GHz broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA) using 100nm gallium nitride (GaN) on silicon process is presented in this paper.

Moreover, the parallel and series-type Doherty combiners are investigated. The series-type Doherty combiner is shown to have wider characteristics than the parallel-type converter-based Doherty combiner via numerical analysis. An approximate analysis was applied to the series-type combiner, and a quasi-optimum design parameter was derived for wideband matching. A quasi-optimum design parameter was compared with a true optimum solution derived by numerical analysis, and its certainty was verified. A combiner with parameters close to the true optimum solution was designed and evaluated. A DPA fabricated using this combiner was adequately small for a 5G mobile handset and could be operated in the frequency range of 2.2\u20132.7 GHz with efficiency exceeding 35% and a sufficiently low distortion under an amplifying wideband modulated signal [fractional bandwidth (FBW): 4% = 0.1/2.5 GHz]. The proposed combiner and its design techniques helped in designing a compact and long battery life of 5G mobile phones with high data throughput at a few gigahertz frequency ranges.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9670864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2021.3124302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/9670864/09618639.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"826","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2021.3124302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Optimization of Doherty Power Amplifier Based on Source Converters for 5G Mobile Handsets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Optimization of Doherty Power Amplifier Based on Source Converters for 5G Mobile Handsets","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9618639/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Optimization of Doherty Power Amplifier Based on Source Converters for 5G Mobile Handsets","sourcePdf":"tmtt-imai-3124302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085417S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"9670864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","xplore-issue":"9670864","articleId":"9618639","onlineDate":"17 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":9618650,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Iepure","affiliation":["Bosch Security Systems, Lancaster, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/9660829/9618650/iepur-3128825-small.gif","p":["Bogdan Iepure received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering technology and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Penn State University, Harrisburg, PA, USA.

The PTZ auto tracking function enables the camera to control its electric motor mechanisms to adjust the course of the optical sensor field of view (FOV) to track moving objects automatically. In this paper, a proposed novel object tracking method based on the fusion of thermal, optical sensor and millimeter-wave data is implemented. The implementation of the proposed method is performed on a pan-tilt setup, which ultimately tracks the object of interest based on thermal data while keeping the optical image resolution the same as the thermal image resolution and provides valuable distance measurements to the target based on the millimeter-wave radar readings. The proposed method offers improvements over conventional optical sensor tracking by adding an extra layer to object tracking through additional thermal and millimeter-wave sensor data, which in turn provides a surplus of information of the object of interest that is being tracked. The proposed method compares favorably with commercially available surveillance systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2021.3128825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","startPage":"372","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2021.3128825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660829","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/9660829/09618650.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","Optical sensors","Radar","Object tracking","Laser radar","Thermal sensors","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","wavelets","segmentation","millimeter-wave image","object tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Tracking Algorithm Using Thermal and Optical Cameras Fused With mmWave Radar Sensor Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618650/","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9618650/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Tracking Algorithm Using Thermal and Optical Cameras Fused With mmWave Radar Sensor Data","sourcePdf":"tce-morales-3128825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067962S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"9660829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","xplore-issue":"9660829","articleId":"9618650","onlineDate":"17 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9618652,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Pervasive Communication Research Center, Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8782661/9309127/9618652/he-3128637-small.gif","p":["Shiwen He (Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from the Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","Since April 2018, he has been a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China.

Prediction Accuracy of Solar Power Generation using a Generative Adversarial Network","abstract":"Solar power is the most widely used green energy. However, using solar power generation as a stable power supply remains challenging since the power output is difficult to predict. Accurate prediction of solar power generation enables efficient control of the amount of stored electricity in batteries to produce a stable supply of electricity. This paper aims to build a highly accurate solar power prediction model. For this purpose, we design a neural network model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the future solar power generation using past solar power generation and weather forecasts. Since a large and diverse dataset is required to train an accurate prediction model, we develop a neural network based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate artificial datasets from the original training dataset to increase the amount and diversity of the training dataset. Additionally, stratified k-fold cross-validation is used to eliminate learning deviation during training. As a result, the proposed neural network model based on GAN improved the R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n score of LSTM from 0.750 to 0.805 with stratified k-fold cross-validation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618702/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9618702/","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2021","conferenceDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the Prediction Accuracy of Solar Power Generation using a Generative Adversarial Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the Prediction Accuracy of Solar Power Generation using a Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IGESSC_2021_paper_30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069837S","chronDate":"1-2 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618669","isNumber":"9618676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618669","xplore-issue":"9618676","articleId":"9618702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9618711,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Taghizadeh","affiliation":["Faculty of Medical Science and Technology, Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Taghizadeh","id":"37089174481"},{"name":"Sina Nateghi","affiliation":["Technical and Engineering Faculty, Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Nateghi","id":"37089168155"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3607-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3606-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3608-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9618711","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Conferences","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Electromyography","Real-time systems","Prosthetic hand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electromyography","discrete wvelet transform","reflection coefficients","feature extraction","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618711","abstract":"Real-time control of prosthetic hands has attracted huge attention from researchers in recent years. Real-time analysis of Electromyography (EMG) signals has several challenges. The most important one is to achieve an acceptable classification accuracy by observing a limited length of the EMG signal. In this paper, we address these challenges i.e., we enhance the classification accuracy and reduce the required observation signal\u2019s length. These goals are achieved by employing extracted features from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains and introducing a new neural network architecture to combine these features. The experimental results illustrate that combining features from different domains and the proposed architecture improve the accuracy of real-time classification of EMG signals in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/NBEC53282.2021.9618711","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE National Biomedical Engineering Conference (NBEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBEC53282.2021.9618711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9618707","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE National Biomedical Engineering Conference (NBEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9618739/9618707/09618711.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Electromyography Signals Using Neural Networks and Features From Various Domains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618711/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Electromyography Signals Using Neural Networks and Features From Various Domains","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9618711/","publicationDate":"9 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Electromyography Signals Using Neural Networks and Features From Various Domains","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day1T2B_taghizadeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140215S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618739","isNumber":"9618707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618739","xplore-issue":"9618707","articleId":"9618711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9618724,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Mo Kang","affiliation":["University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9618724/kang-3126555-small.gif","p":["Sung Mo (Steve) Kang (Life Fellow, IEEE) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) from Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, NJ, USA, the M.S. degree from the State University of New York, Buffalo, and the Ph.D. degree from UC Berkeley.

The first neuron model is called the Memristive Integrate-and-Fire (MIF) model, for neuronal signaling with two voltage levels: the spike-peak, and the rest-potential. The second model MIF2 is also presented, which promotes local adaptation by accounting for a third refractory voltage level during hyperpolarization. We show both compact models are minimal in terms of the number of circuit elements and integration area. Using the MIF and MIF2 models, we postulate the design of a memristive solid-state brain with an estimation of its surface area and power consumption. Analytical projections show that a memristive solid-state brain could be realized within (i) the surface area of the median human brain, 2,400cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, (ii) the same volume of the median human brain, and (iii) a total power budget of approximately 20 W using a 3.5 nm technology. Distinct from the past decade of memristive neuron literature, our benchmarks are attained using generic commercially available memristors that are reproducible using off-the-shelf components. We expect this work can promote more experimental demonstrations of memristive circuits that do not rely on prohibitively expensive fabrication processes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09618724.pdf","startPage":"4837","endPage":"4850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3126555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618724/","displayDocTitle":"How to Build a Memristive Integrate-and-Fire Model for Spiking Neuronal Signal Generation","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9618724/","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005595","fundingName":"University of California Research Grant"},{"fundingName":"Forrest Research Fellowship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1915550"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016732","fundingName":"LG Yeonam Cultural Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"2019R1A2C1011155"},{"fundingName":"Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evulation (IITP) through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2019-0-00421"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)","grantNumber":"411647366"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)","grantNumber":"FA9950-18-1-0016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Build a Memristive Integrate-and-Fire Model for Spiking Neuronal Signal Generation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kang-3126555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131441S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9618724","onlineDate":"17 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9618752,"authors":[{"name":"Chan Xiao Jing","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technology Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Jalan Universiti, Kampar, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chan Xiao","lastName":"Jing","id":"37089169315"},{"name":"Goh Chuan Meng","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technology Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Jalan Universiti, Kampar, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Goh Chuan","lastName":"Meng","id":"37089164292"},{"name":"Chai Meei Tyng","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technology Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Jalan Universiti, Kampar, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chai Meei","lastName":"Tyng","id":"37085438439"},{"name":"Sayed Ahmad Zikri bin Sayed Aluwee","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technology Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Jalan Universiti, Kampar, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sayed Ahmad Zikri bin Sayed","lastName":"Aluwee","id":"37088593289"},{"name":"Wong Pei Voon","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technology Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Jalan Universiti, Kampar, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wong Pei","lastName":"Voon","id":"37086080740"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3607-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3606-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3608-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9618752","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618752","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Sensitivity","Fluids","Veins","Feature extraction","Fatigue","Physiology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intravenous (IV) access","subcutaneous vein detection","deep learning","U-Net"]}],"abstract":"Intravenous (IV) access is a common and yet important daily clinical procedure that delivers fluids or medication into a patient\u2019s vein. However, IV insertion is very challenging where clinicians are suffering in locating the subcutaneous vein due to patients\u2019 physiological factors such as hairy forearm and thick dermis fat, and also medical staff\u2019s level of fatigue. As a result, the patients are suffering from multiple IV insertions and the problem has not yet been resolved till-date. Thus, researchers have proposed an autonomous machine for IV access, but such equipment is lack of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in detecting the vein accurately. Therefore, this project proposes an automatic vein detection algorithm using deep learning for Intravenous (IV) access purposes. U-Net, a fully connected network (FCN) architecture is employed in this project due to its capability in detecting the near-infrared (NIR) subcutaneous vein. In our experiment, data augmentation is applied to increase the dataset size and reduce the bias from overfitting. The original U-Net architecture is optimized by replacing up-sampling with transpose convolution as well as the additional implementation of batch normalization. Lastly, the proposed algorithm has achieved an accuracy and specificity of 0.9909 and 0.9970, respectively. This result indicates that the proposed algorithm can be applied into the venipuncture machine to locate the Subcutaneous vein for intravenous (IV) procedures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9618707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NBEC53282.2021.9618752","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE National Biomedical Engineering Conference (NBEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE National Biomedical Engineering Conference (NBEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9618739/9618707/09618752.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","doi":"10.1109/NBEC53282.2021.9618752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic Vein Detection System Using Deep Learning for Intravenous (IV) Access Procedure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic Vein Detection System Using Deep Learning for Intravenous (IV) Access Procedure","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9618752/","publicationDate":"9 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618752/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic Vein Detection System Using Deep Learning for Intravenous (IV) Access Procedure","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Day1T4A_chan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062767S","chronDate":"9-10 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618739","isNumber":"9618707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618739","xplore-issue":"9618707","articleId":"9618752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":9618821,"authors":[{"name":"Sidharth Gupta","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Sidharth","lastName":"Gupta","orcid":"0000-0003-0312-2938","id":"37086864247"},{"name":"Ivan Dokmani\u0107","affiliation":["University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Dokmani\u0107","orcid":"0000-0001-7132-5214","id":"37077320400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9618821","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Least Squares Phase Retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618821","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements","Optical variables measurement","Signal processing algorithms","Measurement uncertainty","Geometry","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase retrieval","total least squares","operator error","sensing vector error","quadratic equations"]}],"abstract":"We address the phase retrieval problem with errors in the sensing vectors. A number of recent methods for phase retrieval are based on least squares (LS) formulations which assume errors in the quadratic measurements.

We show how gradient descent and the specific geometry of the phase retrieval problem can be used to obtain a simple and efficient TLS solution. Additionally, we derive the gradients of the TLS and LS solutions with respect to the sensing vectors and measurements which enables us to calculate the solution errors. By analyzing these error expressions we determine conditions under which each method should outperform the other. We run simulations to demonstrate that our method can lead to more accurate solutions. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing phase retrieval experiments on real optical hardware which naturally contains both sensing vector and measurement errors.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3128750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9675017/09618821.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9675017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3128750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2021","displayDocTitle":"Total Least Squares Phase Retrieval","volume":"70","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9618821/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2022","publicationDate":"2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9618821/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"852821\u2014SWING"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Total Least Squares Phase Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tsp-gupta-3128750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091751S","chronDate":"2022","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9675017","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9675017","articleId":"9618821","onlineDate":"17 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":9618854,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Friedlander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Friedlander","orcid":"0000-0001-5133-2433"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"9618854","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Receiving antennas","Mathematical models","Location awareness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas","array processing","direction-of-arrival","electromagnetic","far-field","localization","near-field","range"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9618854","abstract":"In the aforementioned paper the authors investigate the localization of multiple near-field narrowband sources with a symmetric uniform linear array, and develop a new linear prediction approach based on the truncated singular value decomposition.

To overcome these shortcomings, in this study, we propose a model that performs convolution operation on input data and the output of a Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Second, a self-attention operation is added to capture the local and global dependencies of the hidden state of LSTM. The proposed network structure is inserted in an encoding\u2013forecasting network framework and applied to spatiotemporal sequence forecasting. Third, the outputs of the precede sequence are also regarded as the inputs of according LSTM layer and this operation effectively captures temporal feature of sequence data.

For the achievability, we first consider the case of the one-bit ADCs at the legitimate receiver and apply a binary input distribution where the two input points have the same phase when the channel gain at the legitimate receiver is less than that at the eavesdropper, and otherwise the opposite phase. Then the result is generalized for the case of arbitrary finite-resolution ADCs at the legitimate receiver by translating the input distribution appropriately. We also provide numerical lower bounds on the achievable secrecy rates, and analyze the tendency of the secrecy rates according to the channel difference, the power constraint, and the quantization levels for some cases.

In these more complex games with more limited visual information, agents must choose where to look and how to optimally use their limited visual information in order to succeed at the game. We verify that with a relatively simple model the agent can learn where to look in scenarios with a limited visual bandwidth. We develop a method for masking part of the environment in Atari games to force the RL agent to learn both where to look and how to play the game in order to study where the RL agent learns to look. In addition, we develop a neural network architecture and method for allowing the agent to choose where to look and what action to take in the Pong game. Further, we analyze the strategies the agent learns to better understand how the RL agent learns to play the game.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9619004/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Partial Observability in Games: Learning to Both Act and Observe","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to Partial Observability in Games: Learning to Both Act and Observe","confLoc":"Copenhagen, Denmark","sourcePdf":"paper_274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.270673S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618888","isNumber":"9618891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618888","xplore-issue":"9618891","articleId":"9619004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":9619012,"authors":[{"name":"Dimosthenis Tzanakos","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimosthenis","lastName":"Tzanakos"},{"name":"Foivos Allayiotis","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Foivos","lastName":"Allayiotis"},{"name":"Vasileios Kokkinos","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Kokkinos"},{"name":"Christos Bouras","affiliation":["University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Bouras"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-903176-42-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0880-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-3644"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2163-4033"}],"articleNumber":"9619012","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","5G mobile communication","Prediction algorithms","Throughput","MIMO","Reliability","Task analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","MIMO","optimization","throughput","channel state information"]}],"doi":"10.23919/WMNC53478.2021.9619012","pdfPath":"/iel7/9618887/9618889/09619012.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 13th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 13th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)","startPage":"48","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9618889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/WMNC53478.2021.9619012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mechanism for 5G MIMO performance optimization and evaluation","abstract":"MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) technology has become a fundamental technique in current wireless communications, both in cellular and Wi-Fi networks. Fifth generation networks (5G) are expected to support extremely high data rates and more reliable services. The performance of 5G networks can be significantly improved with MIMO; yet the integration of optimization algorithms can further improve its performance. The purpose of this paper is to study an optimization technique for Channel State Prediction in a MIMO environment. We will examine a specific interconnection between 5G and optimization algorithms, to produce a feasible Channel State Prediction mechanism. For our experiments, we use a Dataset produced by the DeepMIMO simulator, which sets up all necessary parameters for our experiment. On this dataset we apply the Hungarian Algorithm to optimize the total throughput and based on the results we conclude that such mechanism is feasible and required for the introduction of 5G Networks in day-to-day tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619012/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9619012/","publicationDate":"20 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A mechanism for 5G MIMO performance optimization and evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mechanism for 5G MIMO performance optimization and evaluation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"07_PID1570745013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055225S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618887","isNumber":"9618889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618887","xplore-issue":"9618889","articleId":"9619012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9619029,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Dockhorn","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Dockhorn","id":"37085539960"},{"name":"Jorge Hurtado-Grueso","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Hurtado-Grueso","id":"37088936199"},{"name":"Dominik Jeurissen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Jeurissen","id":"37088936151"},{"name":"Linjie Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Linjie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087014290"},{"name":"Diego Perez-Liebana","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Perez-Liebana","id":"37085693107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3886-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4608-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-4289"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2325-4270"}],"articleNumber":"9619029","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"abstract":"When implementing intelligent agents for strategy games, we observe that search-based methods struggle with the complexity of such games. To tackle this problem, we propose a new variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search which can incorporate action and game state abstractions. Focusing on the latter, we developed a game state encoding for turn-based strategy games that allows for a flexible abstraction. Using an optimization procedure, we optimize the agent's action and game state abstraction to maximize its performance against a rule-based agent. Furthermore, we compare different combinations of abstractions and their impact on the agent's performance based on the Kill the King game of the Stratega framework. Our results show that action abstractions have improved the performance of our agent considerably. Contrary, game state abstractions have not shown much impact. While these results may be limited to the tested game, they are in line with previous research on abstractions of simple Markov Decision Processes. The higher complexity of strategy games may require more intricate methods, such as hierarchical or time-based abstractions, to further improve the agent's performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Games","Machine learning","Markov processes","Search problems","Encoding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Action Abstraction","Game State Abstraction","General Strategy Game-playing","Stratega","Monte Carlo Tree Search","N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CoG52621.2021.9619029","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9618888/9618891/09619029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9618891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoG52621.2021.9619029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game State and Action Abstracting Monte Carlo Tree Search for General Strategy Game-Playing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Game State and Action Abstracting Monte Carlo Tree Search for General Strategy Game-Playing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619029/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9619029/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game State and Action Abstracting Monte Carlo Tree Search for General Strategy Game-Playing","confLoc":"Copenhagen, Denmark","sourcePdf":"paper_271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064732S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9618888","isNumber":"9618891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9618888","xplore-issue":"9618891","articleId":"9619029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":9619255,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin biology as a whole. One of the abiotic factors is the soil. Macronutrients are elements which plants require in relatively large amounts whereas micronutrients are those which plants require in much smaller amounts. A combination of macronutrients and micronutrients give the soil its optimum health. A lack of any one of these nutrients can significantly impact the health and longevity of a plant. Natural deficiencies in soil can be supplemented by using the proper applications and techniques to ensure maximum growth and yield of the plants. When plants get good nutrition, they grow well and give farmers the best possible yield in return. In this paper Back Propagation Neural Network using trapezoidal fuzzy number is applied to optimise the exact requirement of nutrient in the soil to maximise the yield of the plant. The wheat seeds sown in four different wheat fields are taken as the input. The weights denote the quantity of macronutrients viz., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur applied to each field. The inputs and weights are feed forwarded to find the output of the hidden layer which gives the yield on application of only the macronutrients. The micronutrients viz., boron, chlorine, iron and manganese are supplied to each field and the total yield of all the four fields is also recorded. If the yield obtained is not the expected output then by back propagation, the error is identified and the optimum quantity of macronutrients and micronutrients to be applied are calculated till the maximum yield is obtained. The application of nutrients to the wheat fields in each trial is plotted graphically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619255/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9619255/","publicationDate":"19 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the Impact of Abiotic Factors on Wheat Crop Production using Back Propagation Fuzzy Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the Impact of Abiotic Factors on Wheat Crop Production using Back Propagation Fuzzy Neural Network","confLoc":"Raigarh, India","sourcePdf":"ETI4020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06337S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9619189","isNumber":"9619190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9619189","xplore-issue":"9619190","articleId":"9619255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":9619260,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Han","affiliation":["College of Science, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Han","id":"37089167046"},{"name":"Guici Chen","affiliation":["College of Science, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guici","lastName":"Chen","id":"37557253300"},{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, South-Central University For Nationalities, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38247940700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3517-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3518-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9619260","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Delay effects","Neural networks","Delays","Feedback control","Control theory","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["exponential stabilization","fuzzy","inertial neural networks(INNs)","mixed delays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAI53119.2021.9619260","pdfPath":"/iel7/9619188/9619193/09619260.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAI53119.2021.9619260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential stabilization of fuzzy inertial neural networks with mixed delays","abstract":"This paper discusses the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of fuzzy inertial neural networks(FINNs) with mixed delays.

In practice, however, the process data are generally collected at multiple different rates, resulting in structurally-incomplete training data. Under such circumstances, how to build effective deep models to fully mine the multirate sampled data has become a constraint in achieving better process monitoring performance. In this paper, a sequentially-adaptive deep variational model is designed in which the knowledge that existed in variables with different rates is comprehensively extracted through deep generative neural networks. The multirate samples are first divided into multiple data blocks in which each block is collected at a uniform rate. A deep generative model is then constructed to model the uncertain data distribution and extract probabilistic feature representations considering the slowness principle. To restrain the small data problem in the blocks with slow rates, a sequentially-adaptation strategy is designed to adapt the knowledge from the fast blocks with sufficient training data and enhance the overall modeling performance. The effectiveness is demonstrated through a real-world industrial thermal power plant case.","doi":"10.1109/IAI53119.2021.9619404","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9619188/9619193/09619404.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 3rd International Conference on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAI53119.2021.9619404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sequentially-Adaptive Deep Variational Model for Multirate Process Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process monitoring","Adaptation models","Neural networks","Training data","Feature extraction","Thermal conductivity","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["process monitoring","anomaly detection","deep learning","variational autoencoders"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Sequentially-Adaptive Deep Variational Model for Multirate Process Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9619404/","publicationDate":"8 Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011248","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011311","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004835","fundingName":"Zhejiang University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sequentially-Adaptive Deep Variational Model for Multirate Process Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Shenyang, China","sourcePdf":"IAI21-0130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054803S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9619188","isNumber":"9619193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9619188","xplore-issue":"9619193","articleId":"9619404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9619421,"authors":[{"name":"Hareba Omar Mohamed Omar","affiliation":["City University Petaling Jaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hareba Omar","lastName":"Mohamed Omar","id":"37089172115"},{"name":"S B Goyal","affiliation":["City University Petaling Jaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"S B","lastName":"Goyal","id":"37088459472"},{"name":"Vijayakumar Varadarajan","affiliation":["University of South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Vijayakumar","lastName":"Varadarajan","id":"37089173471"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4663-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9619421","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"Fog computing is an extended concept of cloud computing or edge computing. It was introduced to reduces the overhead and existing issues of cloud such as latency, wastage of resources, mobility support, etc. As fog computing is decentralized architecture to process incoming network traffic. With increasing traffic, there is an increase in network threats. To handle such threats, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) provide secure network traffic flow. Due to the limitation of resources over the fog network, it is required to design lightweight IDS. In this paper, to provide efficient detection of incoming network traffic, a deep learning technique is proposed and implemented with a sliding window that identifies the attacks over network. The result analysis was performed by in-creasing the window size and showed up its efficiency with other existing techniques. The result was evaluated over the NSL-KDD dataset. The testing scenario was performed over multi-classification of data packets. The highest accuracy of approx. 99% was achieved over the NSL-KDD dataset.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Cloud computing","Feature detection","Intrusion detection","Telecommunication traffic","Market research","Safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog Computing","Intrusion","Deep Learning","CNN","Sliding Window"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ETI4.051663.2021.9619421","publicationTitle":"2021 Emerging Trends in Industry 4.0 (ETI 4.0)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Emerging Trends in Industry 4.0 (ETI 4.0)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9619189/9619190/09619421.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETI4.051663.2021.9619421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Sliding Window Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Fog Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Sliding Window Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Fog Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619421/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9619421/","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Sliding Window Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection in Fog Computing","confLoc":"Raigarh, India","sourcePdf":"ETI4045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066827S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9619189","isNumber":"9619190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9619189","xplore-issue":"9619190","articleId":"9619421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":9619681,"authors":[{"name":"Wenshuo Zhai","affiliation":["College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wenshuo","lastName":"Zhai"},{"name":"Guanlin Wu","affiliation":["College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Guanlin","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Lehai Xin","affiliation":["College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Lehai","lastName":"Xin"},{"name":"Liyuan Niu","affiliation":["College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Liyuan","lastName":"Niu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2466-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2467-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9619681","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Economics","Training","Smoothing methods","Recurrent neural networks","Time series analysis","Decision making","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)","broad money supply(M2)","system forecast","time series analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619681","abstract":"The broad money supply (M2) reflects changes in aggregate demand and future inflationary pressures. Forecasting the broad money supply is of great significance to economic and financial decision-making. The factors affecting the changes in the broad money supply are diverse and unclear. Therefore, this article forecasts the broad money supply based on time series. In this article, we established a broad money supply forecasting model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This model has a long-term memory function, which effectively solves the problems of vanishing gradient and exploding gradient in the long sequence training process. In the experiment, we have established the model based on RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and traditional forecasting models such as exponential smoothing forecasting models and regression forecasting models to compare with the broad money supply forecasting model based on LSTM. The exponential regression forecasting model with the highest prediction accuracy in the traditional model has a goodness of fit greater than 0.99. But experiments show that the prediction accuracy of the broad money supply forecasting model based on LSTM is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the prediction accuracy of the exponential regression forecasting model. This shows that the broad money supply forecasting model based on LSTM has extremely high prediction accuracy. The forecasting model of broad money supply based on LSTM is of great significance in the short-term forecasting of Chinese broad money supply.","doi":"10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619681","startPage":"406","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619587","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9619603/9619587/09619681.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecast of Broad Money Supply Based on Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619681/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forecast of Broad Money Supply Based on Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9619681/","publicationDate":"29 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecast of Broad Money Supply Based on Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN)","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"58a102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087225S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9619603","isNumber":"9619587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9619603","xplore-issue":"9619587","articleId":"9619681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9619729,"authors":[{"name":"Dajiang Lei","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Lei"},{"name":"Xin Luo","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Liping Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xingxing Li","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xingxing","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Qun Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Weisheng Li","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Image Cognition, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2466-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2467-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9619729","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Learning systems","Pansharpening","Big Data","Visual effects","Data models","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interpretable","deep neural network","variational model","pansharpening"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619729","abstract":"The fusion of panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images aims to generate high-resolution multispectral images, also known as pansharpening. Among the pansharpening methods, deep learning-based methods have become the most popular solution. However, most deep learning-based methods have difficulty in making trade-offs between spectral and spatial information preservation as well as lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep neural network approach based on one observation model. Specifically, a hypothesis is proposed, which assumes that the high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image is composed of the addition of the structural part and the spectral part, in which the spectral part is obtained by upsampling MS image. According to the observation model, we construct two variational models describing two type linear mapping relationship, one between HRMS and MS image, and another between HRMS and PAN image. The structural part is obtained by alternately solving the two variational models with the proximal gradient descent algorithm. Finally, We construct panchromatic and multispectral image fusion network (PMFNet) using deep unfolding method. PMFNet is interpretable with the iterative sovling steps of our proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on GaoFen-2 and WorldView-2 datasets, which show that our proposed method is superior to the state of the art methods.","doi":"10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619729","pdfPath":"/iel7/9619603/9619587/09619729.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"78","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)","publicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9619587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interpretable Deep Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Fusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Interpretable Deep Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Fusion","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2021","publicationDate":"29 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9619729/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61936001,61972060,U1713213,62027827"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2019YFE0110800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0025,cstc2019cxcyljrc-td0270"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interpretable Deep Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Fusion","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"11a171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068654S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9619603","isNumber":"9619587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9619603","xplore-issue":"9619587","articleId":"9619729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9619765,"authors":[{"name":"Honggang Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/9670432/9619765/chen-3124370-small.gif","p":["Honggang Chen (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2014 and 2019, respectively.","From 2017 to 2018, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.

The redundancy in images can be reduced to decrease data size via lossy compression, such as the most widely used standard Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). However, the decompressed images generally suffer from various artifacts (e.g., blocking, banding, ringing, and blurring) due to the loss of information, especially at high compression ratios. This article presents a feature-enriched deep convolutional neural network for compression artifacts reduction (FeCarNet, for short). Taking the dense network as the backbone, FeCarNet enriches features to gain valuable information via introducing multi-scale dilated convolutions, along with the efficient \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1 \\times 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n convolution for lowering both parameter complexity and computation cost. Meanwhile, to make full use of different levels of features in FeCarNet, a fusion block that consists of attention-based channel recalibration and dimension reduction is developed for local and global feature fusion. Furthermore, short and long residual connections both in the feature and pixel domains are combined to build a multi-level residual structure, thereby benefiting the network training and performance. In addition, aiming at reducing computation complexity further, pixel-shuffle-based image downsampling and upsampling layers are, respectively, arranged at the head and tail of the FeCarNet, which also enlarges the receptive field of the whole network. Experimental results show the superiority of FeCarNet over state-of-the-art compression artifacts reduction approaches in terms of both restoration capacity and model complexity. The applications of FeCarNet on several computer vision tasks, including image deblurring, edge detection, image segmentation, and object detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of FeCarNet further.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9619765/","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","pubMedId":"34793307","volume":"33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Feature-Enriched Deep Convolutional Neural Network for JPEG Image Compression Artifacts Reduction and its Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871279 and 62001316"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2021SCU12061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feature-Enriched Deep Convolutional Neural Network for JPEG Image Compression Artifacts Reduction and its Applications","sourcePdf":"tnnls-he-3124370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215025S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"9670432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","xplore-issue":"9670432","articleId":"9619765","onlineDate":"18 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":9619766,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas A.

While cobalt interconnects may enable lower line resistance in narrow signal lines than industry-standard copper interconnects below a threshold pitch, there is still a significant performance penalty associated with using cobalt in wide lines, including both signal and power. For wide signal lines at minimum-pitch metallization levels, we find a delay penalty as much as 60%\u2013100% depending on signal run length for Co interconnects. For wide power lines at minimum-pitch metallization levels, we find a parasitic voltage (IR) drop penalty as high as 50% for Co interconnects. In light of these performance disadvantages, we discuss several design strategies to minimize the impact of Co metallization for both signal routing and power delivery. We also highlight critical differences between low-power and high-performance design points for power delivery.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3126541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3126541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686552","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9686552/09619766.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619766","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Capacitance","Integrated circuit interconnections","Transistors","Delays","Conductors","Conductivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternate conductor","interconnects","IR drop","performance","power line","signal line"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power Delivery Design, Signal Routing, and Performance of On-Chip Cobalt Interconnects in Advanced Technology Nodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9619766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9619766/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Delivery Design, Signal Routing, and Performance of On-Chip Cobalt Interconnects in Advanced Technology Nodes","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lanzillo-3126541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076732S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9686552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9686552","articleId":"9619766","onlineDate":"18 November 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":9619966,"authors":[{"name":"Xinrong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinrong","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Xianchao Xiu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xianchao","lastName":"Xiu","orcid":"0000-0002-3374-7413"},{"name":"Wanquan Liu","affiliation":["School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wanquan","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-4910-353X"},{"name":"Zhonghua Miao","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghua","lastName":"Miao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9619966","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Newton-Based Method for Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9619966","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Minimization","Mathematical models","Correlation","Convergence","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-view learning","generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA)","sparse optimization","Newton method"]}],"abstract":"Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) that aims to deal with multi-view data has attracted extensive attention in signal processing.
