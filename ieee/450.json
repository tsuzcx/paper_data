Computer programs for product design may be divided into two characteristic types: performance programs for which the dimensions and other parameters are given as input, and synthesis programs for which the required performance specifications are given as input. Performance programs have been described in the literature for several kinds of power and industrial electric equipment. They are a useful and necessary prerequisite to design synthesis programs which appear to have found their first and most common application in power transformer design. In the opinion of the authors, an extension of the philosophy of design synthesis to the design of rotating machinery is perhaps more difficult, but still a practical venture. A list of programs in actual use for rotating machine design is presented. The features of one induction motor performance program are first described in some detail followed by a description of three programs for synchronous motor design. The combination of these three programs has many of the features of a complete synthesis program, but with sufficient compromise for practical operation on a medium-sized digital computer.","doi":"10.1109/AIEEPAS.1959.4500442","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

It appears that regardless of the characteristics of an actual load, the dumping of appreciable overload on a generating station is likely to cause the frequency to drop too rapidly to permit manual switching to be effective, and automatic relays are necessary to prevent swamping of generators and to permit rapid restoration of even limited service. 2. Unnecessary line and generating station switching should be avoided. A combination of frequency and reverse power relays may be of assistance in reducing the probability of unnecessary switching, as the arrangement prevents breaker operation unless the load carried by the breaker is at least partially responsible for the underfrequency. 3. Selected loads may be dropped by frequency-sensitive relays. Loads that are likely to stall, causing damage to equipment such as ore crushers, rolling mills, etc., should be prevented from being recharged during the period of serious underfrequency. 4. An analysis is presented which permits consideration of both the normal and rotational power of both generators and loads. This may be useful in establishing settings for under frequency protection equipment.","doi":"10.1109/AIEEPAS.1959.4500531","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

Simplified methods of calculating the voltage across the insulator string are presented based on field-theory concepts for a stroke to the tower with zero towerfooting resistance. 2. The voltage across the insulator string is composed of two components: (a). that produced by the rent and the charge fed into the tower and ground wires, and (b). that produced by the charge above the tower. 3. To calculate the voltage produced by the current and charge fed into the tower and ground wires, conventional traveling-wave theory and methods can be used provided the proper value of surge impedances are used. 4. Equations, based on field theory, are presented to calculate the ground wire and tower surge impedances and the conductor-to-ground mutual impedances. 5. The development of travelingwave theory directly from field theory places traveling-wave theory on a more rigorous basis. 6. To calculate the voltage produced by the charge above the tower, approximate simplified equations are given for a given stroke mechanism. These can be modified for other assumptions. 7. From examples and calculations given in this paper it is possible to gain some insight on the effect of tower geometry, number of ground wires, and position of the conductor on the voltage across the insulator string. Voltages were calculateed across the top and bottom insulator strings of the single-groundwire AEP-OVEC 345-kv tower, across the top insulator string of the two-groundwire AEP-OVEC 345-kv tower, and across the insulator string on the PW&P 220-kv tower.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4500810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"79","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1960","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to the Calculation or the Lightning Perrormance or Transmission Lines III-A Simplified Method: Stroke to Tower","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to the Calculation or the Lightning Perrormance or Transmission Lines III-A Simplified Method: Stroke to Tower","sourcePdf":"AIEEPAS-v79-n3-131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040995S","chronDate":"April  1960","isNumber":"4500679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4498434","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4500810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4500821,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The results of testing bit-plane encoding on particular data gathered by Explorer XII are summarized, and the technique is compared with alternative schemes for encoding the same data. Bit-plane encoding is intended for use aboard spacecraft. The technique presumes input data in binary form. The encoder implementation consists of a memory to store data samples, a monitor, and a code box. Both the monitor and the code box perform simple operations on binary sequences. Bit-plane encoding is especially useful when the data have an amplitude spectrum which is concentrated in different ranges in different time intervals. With a stored group of 128 samples, bit-plane encoding could be used to describe energetic particle counts gathered by Explorer XII with less than 50 percent as many bits as were actually used, and with no loss of information. The technique also conveniently allows certain useful information destroying operations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4501781/04501787.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Plane Encoding: A Technique for Source Encoding","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1966.4501787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4501781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1966.4501787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4501787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4501787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1966","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Plane Encoding: A Technique for Source Encoding","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"July 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"AES-2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Plane Encoding: A Technique for Source Encoding","sourcePdf":"TAES-vAES-2-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042314S","chronDate":"July  1966","isNumber":"4501781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4501787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4501788,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In particular, two phase measurement methods are considered. One method requires the transmission of an auxiliary carrier (in practice, this signal is usually referred to as the sync subcarrier). This carrier is tracked at the receiver by means of a phase-locked loop, and the output of this loop is used as a reference signal for performing a coherent detection. The second method is self-synchronizing in that the reference signal is derived from the modulated data signal by means of a squaring-loop. The statistics (and their properties) of the differenced-correlator outputs are derived and graphically illustrated as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio existing in the tracking filter's loop bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data channel.

A pulsed type radar is assumed, and an ideal (i.e., point) radar target is postulated. This latter restriction is made so that consideration of the effects of target scintillation, glint, or other external random phenomena can be excluded from our treatment of the problem. In this context, a maximum likelihood analysis is made to determine the form of the estimate of angle of arrival, and the probability density function (pdf) of this quantity is computed. The form of the estimate is found to be a ratio of Gaussian variables quite like that used in conventional monopulse signal processing. The pdf obtained for the estimate is believed to be new, and it serves to emphasize the bias and indeterminate variance effects associated with this type of nonlinear signal processing. Some useful approximations to the pdf are discussed, and a unit of precision for the estimate is defined.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4501922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1966.4501931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4501922/04501931.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"556","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1966.4501931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Noise in Amplitude Comparison Monopulse Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Noise in Amplitude Comparison Monopulse Systems","volume":"AES-2","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1966","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4501931/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Noise in Amplitude Comparison Monopulse Systems","sourcePdf":"TAES-vAES-2-n5-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036842S","chronDate":"Sept.  1966","isNumber":"4501922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4501931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4501938,"authors":[{"name":"Robert M.

Propagation and orbital parameters are considered, and data (mainly from computer programs) are presented on time-in-view for various ground locations, mutual visibility time between two orbiting satellites, effects of limiting the antenna elevation angle excursion, antenna pointing considerations, antenna types and gain/beamwidth limitations, and available ground station facilities. Orbits range from 100 to 19,357 nautical miles (nmi) altitude (synchronous) and from O\u00b0 (equatorial) to 90\u00b0 (polar) inclination angles. System design parameters are tabulated for typical links, including transmitter power requirements, doppler shifts, tradeoffs in bandwidth, range, power, and antenna gains. The millimeter wave equipment situation is reviewed because any space system will be limited by the state-of-the-art in hardware and techniques, including performance, reliability, weight, space, and power requirements.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.1966.4502009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4501949/04502009.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.1966.4502009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4501949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Considerations for Millimeter Wave Satellite Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502009/","displayDocTitle":"System Considerations for Millimeter Wave Satellite Communications","volume":"AES-2","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Considerations for Millimeter Wave Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"TAES-vAES-2-n6-Suppl-35.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05247S","chronDate":"Nov.  1966","isNumber":"4501949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4502009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4502060,"authors":[{"name":"Dale A.

By means of an on-line digital method, where advantage is taken of the almost periodic character of the foetal ECG against the random interference, the certainty about the appearance of a foetal R-wave is statistically enlarged. It is thus possible to determine the foetal heart rate as well as the ECG (both abdominal and intra-uterine) with greater accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1966.4502434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4502429/04502434.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4502429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1966.4502434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"175","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Procedure to Represent the Foetal Heart Rate and Electrocardiogram","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Detection Procedure to Represent the Foetal Heart Rate and Electrocardiogram","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502434/","volume":"BME-13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1966","pubMedId":"5978288","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Procedure to Represent the Foetal Heart Rate and Electrocardiogram","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-13-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039054S","chronDate":"Oct.  1966","isNumber":"4502429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4502434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4502457,"authors":[{"name":"D.

On the one hand, there is a redundancy of information in the form of a long lasting FECG and, on the other hand, the human eye fails to survey this information stream.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"BME-15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Weak Foetal Electrocardiograms by Autocorrelation and Crosscorrelation of Envelopes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Weak Foetal Electrocardiograms by Autocorrelation and Crosscorrelation of Envelopes","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-15-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032188S","chronDate":"Jan.  1968","isNumber":"4502521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"42","articleId":"4502528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4502544,"authors":[{"name":"Piet Bergveld","affiliation":["Twente University of Technology, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Piet","lastName":"Bergveld","id":"37301312000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4502544","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FETs","Electrodes","Voltage","Testing","Wires","Cable shielding","Earth","Surface impedance","Filters","Size measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502544","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1968.4502544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","abstract":"By placing a field-effect transistor (FET) directly on or near the test object and by supplying the source and drain from low-ohmic points, which follow the potential of the measuring signal with respect to earth, it is possible, with ordinary wires, to connect the test object with FET to the actual amplifier, which is placed at some distance from the test object.

This type of computer needs synchronization pulses, and the simplest methods of computation are those in which these pulses are directly derived from one of the signals (triggered correlation). The first method is to generate a synchronization pulse whenever the signal crosses a pre-set threshold in any direction. In this case, the computer output function is shown to be proportional to the true correlation function, for Gaussian signals. In a second method, synchronization pulses are produced when the signal crosses the threshold in a specified (e.g., positive) direction. Then the computer output is found to be contaminated by a systematic error, which, in turn, depends on the derivative of the correlation function. These two methods are described in detail, both with respect to the results and to the accuracy obtainable. Several other, less important, methods are only briefly described.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1968.4502561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4502554/04502561.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4502554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1968.4502561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502561/","displayDocTitle":"Triggered Correlation","volume":"BME-15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1968","pubMedId":"5667803","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triggered Correlation","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-15-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029117S","chronDate":"July  1968","isNumber":"4502554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"277","articleId":"4502561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4502577,"authors":[{"name":"Peter P.

The central modification consists in introducing feedbacks, that is, a system of regulators at the level of the formed typed of gait only. Such a modification originates from the assumption that a very narrow class of gait types needs to be taken into account when generating the gait. In the paper the gait has been formed on the basis of a fixed program having a kinematic-dynamic character. The kinematic part concerns the kinematic programnmed connections for activating the lower extremities, while the dynamic part exposes appropriate changes in the characteristic coordinates of the compensation system. Such a connection with a minimum number of coordinates extends the possibility of solving the problem of equilibrium in motion for one type of gait without any particular algorithm that would take into account the motion coordinates and form out of them a stable motion at a higher algebraic level.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1969.4502596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4502593/04502596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1969.4502596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4502593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contribution to the Synthesis of Biped Gait","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502596/","displayDocTitle":"Contribution to the Synthesis of Biped Gait","volume":"BME-16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1969","pubMedId":"5775601","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contribution to the Synthesis of Biped Gait","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-16-n1-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034225S","chronDate":"Jan.  1969","isNumber":"4502593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"379","articleId":"4502596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":4502613,"authors":[{"name":"Alfredo Lopez","affiliation":["United States Air Force, School of Aerospace Medicine (SMSBR), Brooks AF Base, Tex. 78235"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Lopez"},{"name":"Philip C.

To increase the selector's usefulness, four data outputs are provided: for use with a paper recorder, two low speed outputs are available- one giving a pulse out for every impulse in the window, and one giving a pulse out for every 10 pulses in the window (to overcome the problem of losing counts when a fast pulse train is processed by a slow system); a high speed output giving one pulse for every impulse in the window is available; finally, an analog output proportional to rate of arrival of impulses in the window is provided. In addition, reference outputs are supplied to display the upper and lower thresholds relative to the signal, so that the window is clearly defined. The circuit is designed to use low cost components.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrophysiology","Data analysis","Signal analysis","Electroencephalography","Circuits","Pulse amplifiers","Thyratrons","Displays","Costs","Differential amplifiers"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Data Display","Electroencephalography","Electrophysiology","Equipment and Supplies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.1969.4502629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4502619/04502629.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4502619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1969.4502629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Peak Amplitude Selector for Electrophysiological Data Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4502629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Peak Amplitude Selector for Electrophysiological Data Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502629/","volume":"BME-16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1969","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"5804083","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Peak Amplitude Selector for Electrophysiological Data Analysis","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-16-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038698S","chronDate":"April  1969","isNumber":"4502619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4502629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4502681,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Points representing the same class of signal will fall into clusters. Cluster boundaries for spike separation are set visually by the investigator. Output is in the form of pulses on different relay lines. The system permits waveforms to overlap up to 15 percent. Examples of system performance with real signals are presented.

The extensive use of integrated-circuit operational amplifiers permits an accurate description of input-output relationships over a wide range of values for all parameters. This facilitates comparison of the results obtained both with neural data and mathematical or digitally simulated models of neural activity. The effect of white noise on interval histograms and their parameters is described and its effect when added to other inputs. Noise disrupts the phase-locked patterns produced by sinusoidal stimuli and the averaged response may become a smooth sinusoidal function in the presence of added noise. Adaptation may produce a phase lead to sinusoidal stimuli, while accommodation may produce a phase lag. Corresponding overshoots or undershoots are seen with square-wave inputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4502739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1970","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"5431637","volume":"BME-17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1970","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Neural Analog Using Integrated Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Neural Analog Using Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-17-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030274S","chronDate":"July  1970","isNumber":"4502728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"81","articleId":"4502739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4502758,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Kwatny","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Kwatny","id":"38091526900"},{"name":"Donald H.

It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1960","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503259/","volume":"HFE-1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1960","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Man-Computer Symbiosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Man-Computer Symbiosis","sourcePdf":"THFE2-vHFE-1-n1-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029833S","chronDate":"March  1960","isNumber":"4503254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4503253","citationCount":"638","articleId":"4503259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4503262,"authors":[{"name":"Richard L.

The results indicated that personnel tend to report human-initiated malfunctions as equipment malfunctions, thus avoiding incrimination of themselves or their fellow workers.

It was also revealed that in two missile systems, human-initiated holds accounted for 16 and 23 per cent of total holds, respectively.

High-resistance grounding (arranged to alarm only) has proven to be a viable grounding mode for 600-V and S-kV systems with an inherent total system charging current to ground (3 Ico) of about 5.5 A or less. Beyond this current limit and in applications at 13.8 kV, high-resistance grounding appears to require direct tripping to prevent fault escalation prior to fault locating and removal. The original objective-avoidance of unscheduled shutdowns- could not be realized. The subsequent solution of direct tripping, rather than alarming only, is shown to result in a grounding scheme which is considered to be subordinate to the low-resistance (about 400 A) grounding scheme. In discussing the probable failure mode of motor windings, it is suggested that a ground fault in a motor winding, operating on a high-resistance grounded system, may be caused by an escalated turn-to-turn insulation failure. An indefinite prolongation of the resultant ground fault is likely to result in a further escalation to a phase-to-phase fault which increases the probability of unscheduled shutdowns and excessive motor damage. A precautionary note is included regarding the effect of static conversion equipment on high-resistance grounding.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1977.4503440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503425/04503440.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1977.4503440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Reality of High-Resistance Grounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503440/","displayDocTitle":"The Reality of High-Resistance Grounding","volume":"IA-13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Reality of High-Resistance Grounding","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-13-n5-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021334S","chronDate":"Sept.  1977","isNumber":"4503425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"81","articleId":"4503440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4503526,"authors":[{"name":"Austin H.

One of the reasons is that a synchronous motor drive can be made self-commutating so that the inverter becomes equivalent to a conventional phase-control bridge converter without large commutating components. The drive to be controlled consists of an inductor alternator coupled to a flywheel that will be used for temporary energy storage. The flywheel speed will vary over a two-to-one range; thus full performance can be achieved using a load-commutated inverter. A simple auxiliary commutating circuit is provided only for initial starting. The drive must operate both from a fixed dc voltage source (battery) and from a variable dc voltage source (dc motor), as it is intended for use in a battery-powered vehicle for load leveling. The load-Commutated inverter consists of two bridges connected in parallel so as to provide two-way power flow by reversing the dc current. The control system described does not use shaft position sensing, but senses the motor terminal voltage and the ac line current to determine the motor Nare internal operating conditions. This control method maintains the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) turn-off time as a constant percentage of the period of the generated back electromotive force (EMF) as speed and current are varied during operation. The inverter turn-off time is thus maintained by feedback control rather than the use of special function generators. A 20-kVA laboratory development drive system has been built and successfully tested using this control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1979.4503613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503601/04503613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1979.4503613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503601","startPage":"63","endPage":"71","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load-Commutated Inverter/Synchronous Motor Drive Without a Shaft Position Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load-Commutated Inverter/Synchronous Motor Drive Without a Shaft Position Sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1979","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load-Commutated Inverter/Synchronous Motor Drive Without a Shaft Position Sensor","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-15-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043575S","chronDate":"Jan.  1979","isNumber":"4503601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4503613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4503680,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Nabae","affiliation":["Technical University of Nagaoka, Nagaoka, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Nabae","id":"37297183400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4503680","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse inverters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage control","AC motors","Frequency","Control systems","Power supplies","Industry Applications Society","Choppers","Arm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503680","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1979.4503680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1979.4503680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503665/04503680.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulse-Amplitude-Modulated Current-Source Inverters for AC Drives","abstract":"In this paper a new ac variable speed motor system driven by the pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) current source inverter is introduced, which is specially fitted for the large capacity application.

It does not make use of transducers or probes to measure the temperature or the flux in the motor.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1980.4503768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503764/04503768.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1980.4503768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503764","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Adaption for the Speed-Controlled Static AC Drive with a Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Adaption for the Speed-Controlled Static AC Drive with a Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503768/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Adaption for the Speed-Controlled Static AC Drive with a Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-16-n2-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044346S","chronDate":"March  1980","isNumber":"4503764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"246","articleId":"4503768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4503770,"authors":[{"name":"Rupprecht Gabriel","affiliation":["Institut fur Regelungstechnik, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Rupprecht","lastName":"Gabriel","id":"38096219000"},{"name":"Werner Leonhard","affiliation":["Institut fur Regelungstechnik, Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Leonhard","id":"37282954100"},{"name":"Craig J.

Based on the more general concept of parallel redundancy, this new technique relies heavily on the inherent capability of a general n-phase ac motor to continue operation with (n -1) or less of its stator phases excited. Motor performance degradation which inevitably accompanies such operation is sensitive to a variety of system parameters including the number of stator phases and the type of excitation source. A thorough evaluation of (n - 1)-phase excitation performance characteristics of an n-phase squirrel-cage induction motor is presented in this paper. Under favorable conditions, a large percentage of the motor's balanced excitation rating can be retained during postfault conditions of steady-state (n -1)-phase excitation. The n-phase-drive units must be conservatively designed to withstand transient stresses associated with fault-induced transitions from balanced n-phase to (n-1)-phase excitation. Key analytical results have been experimentally verified by tests conducted on a 5-hp six-phase squirrel-cage induction motor. Results of this investigation support the basic soundness of the phase-redundancy concept.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1980.4503793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503790/04503793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1980.4503793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503790","startPage":"321","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Reliability in Solid-State AC Drives by Means of Multiple Independent Phase Drive Units","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Reliability in Solid-State AC Drives by Means of Multiple Independent Phase Drive Units","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Reliability in Solid-State AC Drives by Means of Multiple Independent Phase Drive Units","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-16-n3-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021886S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"4503790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"273","articleId":"4503793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4503795,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Nabae","affiliation":["Technical University of Nagaoka, Nagaoka, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Nabae","id":"37297183400"},{"name":"Kenichi Otsuka","affiliation":["Heavy Apparatus Engineering Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"38083975900"},{"name":"Hiroshi Uchino","affiliation":["Heavy Apparatus Engineering Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Uchino","id":"37611277200"},{"name":"Ryoichi Kurosawa","affiliation":["Heavy Apparatus Engineering Laboratory, Toshiba Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Kurosawa","id":"37389430500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4503795","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":785},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Power supplies","Stators","Torque control","DC motors","Frequency control","Magnetic flux","Rotors","Feedback","Angular velocity control"]}],"abstract":"A new speed control system for induction motors has been developed which is capable of controlling with quick field weakening and superior response and stability.

A distinct feature of this speed regulating system is that speed response is improved by using a fast-response current controller for the internal loop. A fast-response current controller is obtained by employing a nonlinear compensation subloop and a proportional plus integral compensation subloop. The nonlinear compensation subloop is used to linearize the nonlinear load characteristics of the thyristor converter, which are encountered under discontinuous conduction states of current. The proportional plus integral compensation subloop reduces the deviation of detected current from the current reference. With these two current-control subloops a fast motor speed response is achieved under discontinuous as well as continuous conduction states; hence the steady-state accuracy of speed is improved. A speed regulator using a microprocessor was trial manufactured and tested with a 20-kW dc motor. It was found that an extremely fast controlled current response can be obtained even with a relatively long sampling period. Further, normal action was confirmed in four-quadrant operation.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1980.4503800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4503790/04503800.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1980.4503800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503790","startPage":"388","endPage":"394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Microprocessor-Controlled Fast-Response Speed Regulator with Dual Mode Current Loop for DCM Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4503800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Microprocessor-Controlled Fast-Response Speed Regulator with Dual Mode Current Loop for DCM Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4503800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Microprocessor-Controlled Fast-Response Speed Regulator with Dual Mode Current Loop for DCM Drives","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-16-n3-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051223S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"4503790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4503800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4503823,"authors":[{"name":"William McMurray","affiliation":["General Electric Company, Corporate Research and Development, P.

Some key machine parameters used in this dynamic model were obtained from finite element field solutions. This dynamic model was used to obtain the transient interaction between a 15-hp samarium cobalt radially oriented permanent magnet electronically operated synchronous machine and its corresponding power conditioner. This machine was constructed for electric vehicle propulsion. Excellent correlation between various digitally simulated and actual test current and voltage waveforms, in various branches of the machine-conditioner network, has been achieved. These results are given. This modeling approach is applied to machines during the design stage, where the finite element modeling is the only way to obtain the necessary machine parameters for dynamic simulation. It is shown how such a combination of the computer-aided design tools can help in prevention of design mis-judgements that can prove costly to remedy once the hardware is in place.

Spray deposition and charge transfer onto idealized target models as functions of target characteristics and intensity of spray-droplet charging are quantified experimentally to achieve a more fundamental understanding of this phenomenon. As compared to similar uncharged sprays, deposition onto smooth spherical, and planar targets was increased up to seven-fold and three-fold, respectively, at optimum spray-charge levels. Space-charge induced target ionization from a 20-mm point protrustion self-limited this electrostatic deposition to only a 3.5-fold increase for the spherical target but caused little reduction for the planar target. As compared with a hydraulic-atomizing nozzle, the charging nozzle increased deposition approximately eight-fold and 24-fold, respectively, onto the spherical and the planar targets. The ratios of charge-to-mass collected on all targets were unexpectedly found to exceed values calculated for the airborne charged-droplet cloud, indicating a possible contact-discharge during elastic collision of conductive droplets at the target.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"IA-18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic Deposition of Pesticide Sprays onto Ionizing Targets: Charge- and Mass-Transfer Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic Deposition of Pesticide Sprays onto Ionizing Targets: Charge- and Mass-Transfer Analysis","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-18-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021368S","chronDate":"Nov.  1982","isNumber":"4504109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4504125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4504149,"authors":[{"name":"Baldwin Bridger","affiliation":["Powell Industries, Inc., Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Baldwin","lastName":"Bridger","id":"37353450600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504149","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grounding","Circuit faults","Power system faults","Surges","Glass industry","Power system transients","Solids","Voltage","Industry Applications Society","Relays"]}],"abstract":"High-resistance grounding of electrical power systems offers many of the advantages of both solidly grounded systems and ungrounded systems, including practical suppression of transient overvoltages, practical reduction of equipment damage due to ground fault, and the ability to continue to operate a system with a ground fault present on one phase.

The ratings for this investigation include residential systems (5-30 kW) that interface with a 240-V single-phase utility connection and intermediate systems (30-200 kW) that interface with a 480-V three- phase utility connection. Both systems mandated that an isolation transformer be provided between the array and the utility interface. A trade-off study was performed for many transistor and thyristor circuits and configurations. The weighting criteria included full- and part-load efficiency, size, weight, reliability, ease of control, injected harmonics, reactive power requirements, and parts cost. As the result of this study, a 10-kW high-frequency PWM transistor inverter feeding a high-frequency isolation transformer with a sinusoidally shaped current wave was selected. The output of the transformer is rectified with a diode bridge rectifier. Four thyristors, used as 60-Hz switches, reverse the polarity of the rectified current on every other half-cycle of the utility voltage. This reversal is accomplished slightly before the natural zero crossing of the voltage, thereby providing commutation for the thyristors. The results in the intermediate rating study targeted on a 100-kW design using power transistors in a full-bridge circuit connected to a 60-Hz three-phase transformer. Three bridge circuits are provided to interface with the polyphase utility. The switching strategy for the power transistors is based on a sine wave shape of current with a controlled deadband.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1983.4504190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504170/04504190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1983.4504190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504170","startPage":"254","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Power Transistors to Residential and Intermediate Rating Photovoltaic Array Power Conditioners","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Power Transistors to Residential and Intermediate Rating Photovoltaic Array Power Conditioners","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1983","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Power Transistors to Residential and Intermediate Rating Photovoltaic Array Power Conditioners","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-19-n2-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020326S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"4504170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"56","articleId":"4504190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4504192,"authors":[{"name":"Phoivos D.

The 28-WT-12 lamp designed for the new system utilizes a redesigned electrode structure which allows the lamp to be started in the rapid start manner but operated in an instant start mode to maximize the discharge efficacy (lumens/watt) while reducing lamp cathode power requirements. A matching two-lamp ballast incorporates a solid-state switching device to turn off the cathode heating circuit automatically once the lamps have started. Both lamps and ballasts are physically interchangeable with conventional equipment so that existing luminaires can be converted without luminaire, lampholder, and wiring modifications. This new lamp/ballast system can achieve efficacy values exceeding 80 Im/W-more than 25 percent better than the performance of conventional fluorescent systems of the early 1970's-along with the excellent life and reliability characteristics typical of electromagnetically ballasted systems. Economic analyses indicate that the new system is appropriate for many new commercial general lighting installations, although it is particularly suitable as a retrofit system for installations where power reductions are essential but where conversion costs must be minimized and illumination levels preserved.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1983.4504267","startPage":"646","endPage":"651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504238/04504267.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1983.4504267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Optimized Fluorescent Lamp and Ballast for Low- Energy General Lighting Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluorescent lamps","Electronic ballasts","Cathodes","Electrodes","Solid state circuits","Switching circuits","Heating","Wiring","Power system reliability","Power system economics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1983","displayDocTitle":"A New Optimized Fluorescent Lamp and Ballast for Low- Energy General Lighting Applications","volume":"IA-19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1983","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Optimized Fluorescent Lamp and Ballast for Low- Energy General Lighting Applications","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-19-n4-29.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033913S","chronDate":"July  1983","isNumber":"4504238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4504267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4504301,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel S.

It is shown that in a three-phase system voltage and frequency control of a three-phase squirrel-cage machine may be attained by PWM of the output of a simplified bridge inverter with only four switches. As the phase voltages are in principle asymmetrical, this technique is called phase asymmetric PWM (PAPWM). The operational region of PAPWM control is investigated theoretically in the frequency plane, compared to PWM control of a six-element bridge, and shown to have application possibilities. The system was experimentally tested on a 1O-kVA four-transistor inverter and experimentally compared to the operation of a six-transistor inverter of the same rating. The entire signal electronics subsystem was also minimized regarding components by using a specially dedicated IC circuit developed for PWM applications in three-phase systems. These results prove that a PAPWM system with a B4 bridge can be operated to give the same operational drive characteristics as a B6 bridge with PWM. The price to be paid for using a bridge with only four switches lies in the higher pulse frequencies required to give the PAPWM the same characteristics as a conventional system. Since transistor switches may be operated at high switching frequencies with low switching losses, the system is well suited to transistor inverter control of induction machine drives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","volume":"IA-20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Investigation of a Three-Phase Induction Machine Drive with a Component Minimized Voltage-Fed Inverter under Different Control Options","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Investigation of a Three-Phase Induction Machine Drive with a Component Minimized Voltage-Fed Inverter under Different Control Options","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-20-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027416S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"4504399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"230","articleId":"4504413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504416,"authors":[{"name":"Power System Relaying Committee","lastName":"Power System Relaying Committee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504416","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protective relaying","Power system relaying","Power system protection","Digital relays","Power system interconnection","Testing","Power system harmonics","Bibliographies","Manufacturing","Harmonic distortion"]}],"abstract":"Sine wave distortions on power systems are shown to affect the performance of both electromechanical protective relays of classical designs and static relays of various designs.

Two approaches which improve the performance of the PWM inverter and largely simplify the control circuit are developed. One depresses the occurrence of subharmonics without making use of the usual synchronization of the carrier wave with the reference waves; the other is a method for reducing the switchings of the power devices.

Cumulative effects at the substation level for random distributions of each of five different charger types are reported. Chargers with and without current- smoothing inductors and with and without controlled rectifiers for maintenance of constant current are included. Results are reported as magnitudes of expected harmonic current; active power; apparent, reactive, and distortive volt amperes; and power factor hour by hour over typical daily recharge cycles for the network of chargers. Results regarding comparisons among chargers demonstrate the desirability of including a current-smoothing inductor in the charging circuit and indicate that constant-current type chargers using controlled rectifiers generate significantly more harmonic current than the simple noncontrolled taper-current chargers. Typical third harmonic current values of 15 A per charger on the 120-V side and 20 A per phase on the 12.8-kV side for a network of chargers (at ten percent penetration of chargers into the residential distribution network) indicate the possibility for harmful effects to customer and utility equipment and for interference into communications circuits. The results reported here should be useful in both predicting harmful effects at various densities of EV chargers on the residential network and in designing chargers to minimize those effects. supported in part by the New England Electric System.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1984","volume":"IA-20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current Harmonics, Voltage Distortion, and Powers Associated with Electric Vehicle Battery Chargers Distributed on the Residential Power System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Harmonics, Voltage Distortion, and Powers Associated with Electric Vehicle Battery Chargers Distributed on the Residential Power System","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-20-n4-Part-I-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034469S","chronDate":"July  1984","isNumber":"4504475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4504481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504483,"authors":[{"name":"Phoivos D.

Addressed issues include the generation of undesired torque pulsations at low speeds and system operating locus limits imposed at high speeds by saturation of the current regulator. Attention is limited to motors in which sources of reluctance torque are suppressed by surface-mounting of the rotor magnets and skewing of the stator slots. Results from the low-speed investigation indicate that the pulsating torque can be minimized by a combination of steps including proper adjustment of the rotor magnet pole atc and effective use of rotor speed feedback compensation. High-speed saturated-regulator performance is significantly influenced by the 120 electrical degree inverter switch conduction intervals inherent with rectangular current excitation. The system torque-speed operating envelope can be expanded by several means, including on-line adjustment of the converter excitation phase angle a, but resulting performance trade-offs require careful scrutiny.

A typical control actuator system is described consisting of a brushless synchronous motor and a transistor chopper inverter. Important aspects of the design and rating of a three-phase motor with rare-earth permanent magnets are pointed out. Several types of construction are described. The machine control system used is the familiar method of cascade control. By application of \"space vectors\" two special methods for fast response current control are developed.

The inverter is a transistorized six-step voltage source inverter, while the motor is a modified standard three-phase squirrel-cage motor. The stator is rewound with two three-phase winding sets displaced from each other by 30 electrical degrees. A model for the system is developed to simulate the drive and predict its performance. The simulation results for steady-state conditions and experimental measurements show very good correlation. It is shown that this winding configuration results in the elimination of all air-gap flux time harmonics of the order (6v \u00b11, v = 1,3,5,...). Consequently, all rotor copper losses produced by these harmonics as well as all torque harmonics of the order (6v, v = 1,3,5,...) are eliminated. A comparison between-the measured instantaneous torque of both three-phase and six-phase six-step voltage-fed induction machines shows the advantage of the six-phase system over the three-phase system in eliminating the sixth harmonic dominant torque ripple.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504571/04504591.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1984.4504591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1984.4504591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Six-Phase Voltage Source Inverter Driven Induction Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Inverters","Induction motors","Predictive models","Stator windings","Steady-state","Air gaps","Copper","Torque measurement","Induction machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Six-Phase Voltage Source Inverter Driven Induction Motor","volume":"IA-20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Six-Phase Voltage Source Inverter Driven Induction Motor","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-20-n5-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031801S","chronDate":"Sept.  1984","isNumber":"4504571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"177","articleId":"4504591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504593,"authors":[{"name":"Nady Boules","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, General Motors Research and Development Laboratories, Warren, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Nady","lastName":"Boules","id":"37296983000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504593","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Permanent magnets","Magnetic circuits","Permeability","Wounds","Finite element methods","Industry Applications Society","Meetings","Permanent magnet machines","Testing"]}],"abstract":"The design of the magnetic circuit of permanent magnet machines differs from that of conventional wound field machines mainly due to the low magnetic permeability of the magnets.

This problem is distinct from back ionization, and it has profound consequences for electrostatic crop spraying of foliar tips. Laser Doppler anemometry was developed to determine the spatial extent to which the counter-flow of ions from earthed points interacts with the spray cloud and how the trajectories of approaching charged droplets are consequently altered. In the vicinity of cylindrical, spherical, and disk targets the two-dimensional velocity fields were measured for conductive droplets of 30-50 Atm diameter of up to -6 mC/kg charge level, delivered by aerodynamic entrainment at 3 m/s. While electrostatic forces were shown to enhance droplet motion toward the various smooth targets, introduction of a 2-cm target point not only negated the electrostatic deposition benefit, but its action in some locations increased droplet repulsion from the targets.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1984.4504649","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504612/04504649.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1984.4504649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perturbations of Charged-Droplet Trajectories Caused by Induced Target Corona: LDA Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Perturbations of Charged-Droplet Trajectories Caused by Induced Target Corona: LDA Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504649/","volume":"IA-20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perturbations of Charged-Droplet Trajectories Caused by Induced Target Corona: LDA Analysis","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-20-n6-37.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040855S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4504612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4504649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4504655,"authors":[{"name":"Gildas Hartmann","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique des Discharge, E.R. 114 du C.N.R.S., Ecole Superieure d'Electricite, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Gildas","lastName":"Hartmann","id":"38079486400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504655","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1144},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Corona","Wire","Geometry","Ionization","Mathematical model","Atmospheric modeling","Space charge","Humidity","Solid modeling","Industry Applications Society"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504655","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1984.4504655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1984.4504655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504612/04504655.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical Evaluation of Peek's Law","abstract":"A theoretical evaluation for Peek's law which yields the corona onset gradient is made in air for positive wire/cylinder and positive point/plane geometries.

A modulated buck converter converts the photovoltaic dc current to a rectified 50-Hz sine wave current, and the following self-commutated half-bridge generates a 50-Hz sine wave current, which is fed into one phase of the public power grid. This nonclassical inverter needs only three power transistor switches and isolates the grid and the photovoltaic array using a commercial 50-Hz transformer. It acts as a current source, and due to pulsewidth modulation its output is a sine wave current with very low total harmonic distortion of one percent. The overall efficiency of the 1-kW prototype is at least 88 percent between 250 and 1000 W, and the projected efficiency is over 90 percent for 1-20 kW. Furthermore, a circuit which tracks the maximum power available from the photovoltaic generator has been developed. This circuit regulates the input power to its maximum by detecting the phase angle between the voltage and power ripples at the inverter input.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504701/04504712.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of a New Inverter Circuit for Direct Photovoltaic Energy Feedback into the Public Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Feedback circuits","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Power generation","Phase modulation","Buck converters","DC generators","Mesh generation","Power grids"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1986","displayDocTitle":"Realization of a New Inverter Circuit for Direct Photovoltaic Energy Feedback into the Public Grid","volume":"IA-22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of a New Inverter Circuit for Direct Photovoltaic Energy Feedback into the Public Grid","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n2-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021694S","chronDate":"March  1986","isNumber":"4504701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4504712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4504717,"authors":[{"name":"Robert D.

Therefore, the vertical wide-base BJT structure influences the following IGT characteristics: 1) the forward current-voltage characteristics, 2) the fall time/forward-voltage drop trade-offs, 3) the high-temperature blocking, and 4) the turn-off current tail. An IGT with punch-through (PT) BJT yields lower forward voltage than that of an IGT with non-punch-through (NPT) BJT due to the thinner base of the PT BJT structure. The punch-through IGT has lower off-state (leakage) current and also shorter turn-off current tail due to lower current gain of a PT BJT than that of an NPT BJT. Both PT and NPT IGT's have large safe operation areas.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504729","startPage":"466","endPage":"470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504729/04504744.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504744","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Insulation","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Tail","Voltage","Power MOSFET","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Industry Applications Society","FETs","Equivalent circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of the Punch-Through and Non-Punch-Through IGT Structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504744/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of the Punch-Through and Non-Punch-Through IGT Structures","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n3-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027778S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4504729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4504744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":4504746,"authors":[{"name":"Osamu Hashimoto","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fuji Electric Corporate Research and Development Limited, Matsumoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37286048000"},{"name":"Humiaki Kirihata","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fuji Electric Corporate Research and Development Limited, Matsumoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Humiaki","lastName":"Kirihata","id":"37353399000"},{"name":"Masahide Watanabe","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fuji Electric Corporate Research and Development Limited, Matsumoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahide","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"38005601200"},{"name":"Akira Nishiura","affiliation":["Electron Device Laboratory, Fuji Electric Corporate Research and Development Limited, Matsumoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Nishiura","id":"37285129300"},{"name":"Saburo Tagami","affiliation":["Matsumoto Factory, Fuji EIectric Company Limited, Matsumoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Saburo","lastName":"Tagami","id":"37377074600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504746","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504746","abstract":"A 4.5-kV 3000-A gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor has been developed for use in high-power motor drive control equipment such as inverters and choppers. The high gate turn-off current of 3000 A is achieved by decreasing the variation of on-state voltages as well as turn-off times between segments which compose the GTO thyristor. This idea is supported by observation of infrared radiation during the turn-off process in the parallel operation of two segments with different on-state voltages or turn-off times. The parallel operation behavior is well simulated by a two-dimensional numerical simulation. Such design considerations and electrical characteristics of the newly developed high-power GTO thyristor are described. The device has a forward blocking capability of 4.5 kV, a maximum gate turn-off current of 3000 A, on-state voltage of 3.0 V at 3000 A, turn-on time of 10 \u03bcs, and turn-off time of 25 \u03bcs.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504729","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504729/04504746.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turn-On and Turn-Off Characteristics of a 4.5-kV 3000-A Gate Turn-Off Thyristor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Voltage","Cathodes","Flexible printed circuits","Electric variables","Anodes","Industry Applications Society","Fingers","Motor drives","Control equipment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","displayDocTitle":"Turn-On and Turn-Off Characteristics of a 4.5-kV 3000-A Gate Turn-Off Thyristor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504746/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","volume":"IA-22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turn-On and Turn-Off Characteristics of a 4.5-kV 3000-A Gate Turn-Off Thyristor","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n3-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024515S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"4504729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4504746","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504768,"authors":[{"name":"Mazen Abdel-Salam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mazen","lastName":"Abdel-Salam","id":"38275977500"},{"name":"E.

This results in an increase of the onset voltage for surface flashover and in a significant saving of the space of the HV installation. The optimization process was achieved by an algorithm developed for calculating the tangential field component and mathematical expressions of the profile to be corrected through an iterative procedure. The algorithm was based on a modified charge simulation technique to satisfy a better matching of the boundary conditions to the electrode and insulator surfaces involved in the HV installation. The algorithm is expanded to study the effect of contamination on the tangential field distribution. It is found that the higher the conductivity of the contamination layer, the higher is the field uniformity along the insulator surface.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504768","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504759/04504768.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"601","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Optimization of High-Voltage Insulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","displayDocTitle":"Field Optimization of High-Voltage Insulators","volume":"IA-22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"July 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Optimization of High-Voltage Insulators","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030258S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4504759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"25","articleId":"4504768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4504778,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy M.

The stationary sine-triangle and hysteretic current regulators are shown to have steady-state characteristics that depend on slip, operating frequency, and motor impedance. In contrast the synchronous regulator, because it lacks these dependencies, exhibits ideal steady-state current regulator characteristics without sacrificing bandwidth.

The history of the SR system, in particular the extensive research at Nottingham and Leeds Universities, and the basic operating principles and design considerations for motors and power converters are reviewed. Alternative configurations are discussed. The difficulties of establishing a simple mathematical model for the motor and of calculating torque and inverter VA requirements are examined. A comparison of the VA requirements for SR and pulsewidth modulation (PWM) is given for a 7.85-kW system. Measured drive performance is discussed in terms of efficiency over an operating envelope, specific output, controllability, and power converter ratings. Earlier traction drives, incorporating a constant power range and including regeneration, are reported together with the constant torque industrial drives and more recent traction extensions. The long-term potential of the drive is discussed for a wide range of applications.

They are robust high powerdensity machines capable of operating at high motor and inverter efficiencies over wide speed ranges, including considerable ranges of constant-power operation. The magnet cost is minimized by the low magnet weight requirements of the IPM design. The impact of the buried-magnet configuration on the motor's electromagnetic characteristics is discussed. The rotor magnetic circuit saliency preferentially increases the quadrature-axis inductance and introduces a reluctance torque term into the IPM motor's torque equation. The electrical excitation requirements for the IPM synchronous motor are also discussed. The control of the sinusoidal phase currents in magnitude and phase angle with respect to the rotor orientation provides a means for achieving smooth responsive torque control. A basic feedforward algorithm for executing this type of current vector torque control is discussed, including the implications of current regulator saturation at high speeds. The key results are illustrated using a combination of simulation and prototype IPM drive measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504759/04504786.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors for Adjustable-Speed Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504786/","displayDocTitle":"Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors for Adjustable-Speed Drives","volume":"IA-22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors for Adjustable-Speed Drives","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n4-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026506S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4504759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"647","articleId":"4504786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4504787,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Le-Huy","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Quebec, Trois Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Hoang","lastName":"Le-Huy","id":"37352492600"},{"name":"Robert Perret","affiliation":[" Domaine Universitaire, ENSIEG, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Perret","id":"37389462400"},{"name":"Rene Feuillet","affiliation":[" Domaine Universitaire, ENSIEG, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"Feuillet","id":"37269401800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504787","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":205,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1802},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Brushless DC motors","Synchronous motors","DC motors","Feeds","Pulse width modulation inverters","Rotors","Brushless motors","Stators","Servomotors"]}],"abstract":"Torque characteristics of brushless dc motors are studied in terms of the EMF and the feed currents for two feeding schemes: two-phase feeding and three-phase feeding.

The first one is based on off-line optimization of individual switching angles and requires a microprocessor for implementation and the second one uses a special subharmonic modulation and could be implemented with analog and medium-scale integration (MSI) digital circuits. When CSI's are used in ac motor drives, the optimal PWM pattern depends on the performance criteria being used, which in turn depend on the drive application. In this paper four different performance criteria are considered: 1) current or torque harmonic elimination, 2) current harmonic minimization, 3) speed ripple minimization, and 4) position error minimization. As an example a self-controlled synchronous motor (SCSM) supplied by the PWM CSI is considered. The performance of the CSI-SCSM with the optimal PWM schemes proposed herein are compared with that using a conventional 120\u00b0 quasi-square wave current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","volume":"IA-22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pulsewidth Modulation for Current Source Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pulsewidth Modulation for Current Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034512S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4504821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"59","articleId":"4504837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504839,"authors":[{"name":"Jacobus D.

If the active current is subtracted from the distorted current, the compensating equipment must be capable of generating the inverse of this difference. Addition of this compensating current to the distorted current then eliminates the distortion. This requires the capability to generate these currents with response times many times less than the fundamental power frequency cycle. This capability is presented by reactively loaded PWM converters. A system configuration with three single-phase PWM converters building a three-phase unit is investigated. The single-phase converter with PWM operation, inductive reactance as load, low-pass input filter, and representative system losses is simulated by state-space techniques. An experimental system of 1 kVA is also constructed for verification. Good correspondence between the simulation and experiment s shown. Starting up the system, compensating the system losses from the supply, and the influence of the control system on the compensating capabilities are investigated. It is concluded that a PWM converter with a reactive load can be used as a fast distortion compensator and that the present state of the art and future development of PWM converter technology will make this technique applicable at least up to 1 Mvar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"IA-22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Experimental Study of a Reactively Loaded PWM Converter as a Fast Source of Reactive Power","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Experimental Study of a Reactively Loaded PWM Converter as a Fast Source of Reactive Power","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n6-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036293S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4504821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4504839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4504840,"authors":[{"name":"Loren H.

It also minimizes total source current. Thus the application of an RPC or SVC to a load may allow addition of substantial new load to existing feeders or substations. A reactive-power compensator suited to industrial ratings (1.0-25 MVA) is described. It utilizes a force-commutated current-source bridge to provide both leading and lagging reactive power. The ability to operate both leading and lagging can reduce by 2:1 the ratings of the RPC itself and the capacitors and magnetics associated with it. The characteristics of the power circuit, the means used to control it, and the resulting dynamic performance is described. Speed of response compares favorably to the thyristor-controlled reactors now in common use as SVC's at higher MVA ratings. This RPC is suited to compensate any balanced three-phase dynamic load.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1986.4504840","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504821/04504840.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1986.4504840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force-Commutated Reactive-Power Compensator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Force-Commutated Reactive-Power Compensator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504840/","volume":"IA-22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force-Commutated Reactive-Power Compensator","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-22-n6-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025675S","chronDate":"Nov.  1986","isNumber":"4504821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4504840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4504848,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The subsequent occasional appearance of similarly devastating arcing ground fault burndowns in equipments operating on medium-voltage low-resistance grounded systems seemed to be irreconcilable with the presence of the relative high value of the neutral grounding resistor. A failure analysis based on on-site observations produced a probable scenario of escalating arcing ground faults, which explains the mechanism that will render the usual and proper complement of time-overcurrent ground-fault relays inoperative.

This paper reports the development and evaluation of a bipolar spray-charging strategy introduced in an effort to further increase the electrodeposition efficiency of charged airborne spray droplets by minimizing corona discharge at prominent leaf tips of such target plants. It was hypothesized that a properly constituted bipolar spray cloud would eliminate this detrimental corona neutralization of the approaching spray by reducing to below threshold the space-charge electric field imposed at the periphery of the target-plant canopy, while still maintaining an adequate local space-charge field within the electrically shielded plant canopy to enhance droplet deposition. Veriable-frequency bipolar square-wave functions ranging from 12 to 36 Hz were input to an induction-charging nozzle to produce spray clouds having the desired space-charge characteristics. Results of experimental charge-and mass-transfer analyses document that the bipolar strategy successfully eliminated induced target-corona but failed to provide any electrodeposition benefit within shielded target zones. As compared with uncharged sprays, however, unipolar-charging enhanced the droplet deposition within similar targets by factors of 1.3- and 1.5-fold for corona and noncorona target conditions, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504890/04504896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504890","startPage":"217","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipolar Spray Charging for Leaf-Tip Corona Reduction by Space-Charge Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bipolar Spray Charging for Leaf-Tip Corona Reduction by Space-Charge Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipolar Spray Charging for Leaf-Tip Corona Reduction by Space-Charge Control","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039647S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4504890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4504896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4504898,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo P.

The resulting advantages are obvious, and they are conclusively demonstrated here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"IA-23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Functional Model for Three-Phase PWM Inverter/Rectifier Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Functional Model for Three-Phase PWM Inverter/Rectifier Converters","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03361S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4504890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4504898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4504899,"authors":[{"name":"Mitsuyuki Hombu","affiliation":["Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuyuki","lastName":"Hombu","id":"37297451900"},{"name":"Shigeta Ueda","affiliation":["Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeta","lastName":"Ueda","id":"37287602100"},{"name":"Akiteru Ueda","affiliation":["Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi and Limited, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Akiteru","lastName":"Ueda","id":"38666537900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504899","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":620},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Thyristors","Voltage control","Rectifiers","Capacitors","Pulse width modulation","AC motors","Surges","Filters","Smoothing methods"]}],"abstract":"With the application of gate turn-off thyristors (GTO's) and PWM control techniques, a current source inverter capable of producing sinusoidal input/output (I/O) voltages and currents has been developed. The sinusoidally modulated current is fed to the GTO's in the rectifier and inverter sections. The overvoltage-absorption capacitors connected to the ac input and output terminals function as a filter and, consequently, the waveforms of the input/output voltages and currents become sinusoidal. Because the PWM control utilizes the high-speed switching characteristics of the GTO's, the dc link current smoothing reactor and the overvoltage absorption capacitors are greatly reduced. The dc link voltage in the rectifier section is controlled to adjust the ac motor current. This is accomplished by using the firing angle shift method in conjunction with the method involving varying the width of the bypass gate pulses, which put the rectifier section into a bypass state. The current source GTO inverter is used to drive an 11-kW induction motor. As a result, excellent acceleration and deceleration characteristics are obtained, which verifies that the new current source inverter is quite suitable for driving an ac motor at variable speeds.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504890/04504899.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Current Source GTO Inverter with Sinusoidal Inputs and Outputs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504899/","displayDocTitle":"A Current Source GTO Inverter with Sinusoidal Inputs and Outputs","volume":"IA-23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Current Source GTO Inverter with Sinusoidal Inputs and Outputs","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044218S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4504890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"93","articleId":"4504899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4504904,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrasekhar Namuduri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Chandrasekhar","lastName":"Namuduri","id":"38510614000"},{"name":"Paresh C.

PM motor drives are readily applicable where full torque is required up to full or base speed. They are, however, limited in their ability to operate in the power-limited regime where the available torque is reduced as the speed is increased above its base value. In contrast with the field weakening approach used in dc drives, the magnet is permanent. The torque-speed operating limits of PM motor drives, of conventional design are explored, and then design measures which can substantially extend operation into the power-limited regime are proposed. A trade-off between the low speed-torque limit and the extent of the speed range above base speed is achieved by variations in magnet dimensions and the depth of inset of the magnets in the rotor iron. Experimental results are presented for two motors of different design, each using neodymium magnets and each supplied from a current-controlled inverter with hysteresis control of current waveshape.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504890/04504909.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operating Limits of Inverter-Driven Permanent Magnet Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504909/","displayDocTitle":"Operating Limits of Inverter-Driven Permanent Magnet Motor Drives","volume":"IA-23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operating Limits of Inverter-Driven Permanent Magnet Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n2-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026322S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4504890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"128","articleId":"4504909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4504934,"authors":[{"name":"Senichi Masuda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Senichi","lastName":"Masuda","id":"37289417900"},{"name":"Masao Washizu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Washizu","id":"37295136500"},{"name":"Masahiro Iwadare","affiliation":["C&C System Research, Laboratory, Nippon Electric Company Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Iwadare","id":"37063217500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504934","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":24,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Voltage","Particle separators","Biological cells","Industry Applications Society","Optical propagation","Frequency","Design methodology","Electrostatics","Electrokinetics"]}],"abstract":"A study of size and charge-dependent separation of small particles in liquid using a traveling-field-type electric curtain device is made. The principle of the separation is to make use of the spatial harmonic components of the rotating traveling field produced by such a device, the first harmonic propagating in one direction, which plays a dominant role in the region distant from the electrodes, and the second harmonic propagating in the opposite direction, which becomes dominant near the electrodes. Small particles brought into this field undergo circular motion and, as a result of field nonuniformity, are repelled from the electrodes and drift in the direction of the dominant harmonics. The lighter or more charged particles are strongly repelled from the electrodes and swept by the first harmonic, while the heavier or less charged particles can approach the electrodes and are transported by the second harmonic in the opposite direction, thus enabling separation by mass and charge. First a theoretical investigation of this method is made to clarify the operation conditions for the separation, then the experimental observations of particle motion are made and scaling laws of transport velocity with the applied voltage and frequency are confirmed. Finally, an example of a cell separator design using this method is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separation of Small Particles Suspended in Liquid by Nonuniform Traveling Field","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504918/04504934.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","displayDocTitle":"Separation of Small Particles Suspended in Liquid by Nonuniform Traveling Field","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-23","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation of Small Particles Suspended in Liquid by Nonuniform Traveling Field","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n3-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050422S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"4504918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"88","articleId":"4504934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4504938,"authors":[{"name":"Damian A.

The effect of the field discharge resistance was investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque Oscillations of Synchronous Motors Under Starting Conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504918/04504939.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","displayDocTitle":"Torque Oscillations of Synchronous Motors Under Starting Conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-23","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Oscillations of Synchronous Motors Under Starting Conditions","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n3-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018756S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"4504918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4504939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4504941,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Viarouge","affiliation":["Departement de Genie Electrique, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Sainte Foy, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Viarouge","id":"37266950900"},{"name":"Michel Lajoie-Mazenc","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Electrotechnique et d'Electronique Industrielle, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Lajoie-Mazenc","id":"38330034700"},{"name":"Christian Andrieux","affiliation":["Moteurs Leroy Somer Usinedes Agriers, 16015 Angouleme, France."],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Andrieux","id":"38227063100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"4504941","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnets","Servomotors","Magnetic materials","Iron","Costs","Permanent magnet motors","Prototypes","Ferrites","Magnetic circuits","Brushless motors"]}],"abstract":"The feasibility and design of permanent magnet servomotors for direct-drive application at a power level near 10 kW at 270 r/min are investigated. Such applications imply low-speed machines with a great amount of iron and permanent magnet material. The compromise between the specific energy and the cost of magnets is one of the usual guides for designing such motors. The performance of an actual prototype shows that the use of low-cost ferrite material associated with a proper flux-concentration structure of a magnetic circuit is especially interesting at this power level. The design procedure is presented with a prediction of the performance based on field calculations, which can be compared with experimental results of generator operation. The motor can be used in several brushless configurations. An evaluation of the performance, in each case, according to the kind of static converter and control strategy is presented. Several improved models and computer simulations are used. The adaptation of the rotor damper circuits to the supply is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504918/04504941.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504918","startPage":"526","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Construction of a Brushless Permanent Magnet Servomotor for Direct-Drive Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Construction of a Brushless Permanent Magnet Servomotor for Direct-Drive Application","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Construction of a Brushless Permanent Magnet Servomotor for Direct-Drive Application","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n3-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05076S","chronDate":"May  1987","isNumber":"4504918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4504941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4504942,"authors":[{"name":"Graham E.

Failure to do so results in a noticeable degradation in torque response. Most of the currently used approaches to achieve this control employ classical control strategies which are only correct for steady-state conditions. A modern control theory approach which circumvents these limitations is developed. The approach uses a state-variable feedback control model of the field-oriented induction machine. This state-variable controller is shown to be intrinsically more robust than PI regulators.

Flux weakening uses stator current components to counter the fixed-amplitude magnetic airgap flux generated by the rotor magnets, performing a role similar to field weakening in a separately excited dc motor. The nature of current regulator saturation caused by the finite inverter dc source voltage is described, marked by premature torque and power degradation at high speeds in the absence of flux-weakening control. This is followed by presentation of a new flux-weakening control algorithm developed as a modification of an established feedforward IPM torque control algorithm described previously in the literature. Attractive features of this new algorithm include smooth drive transitions into and out of the flux-weakening mode, fast response, as well as automatic adjustment to changes in the dc source voltage. Simulation and empirical test results from a 3-hp laboratory IPM motor drive are used to confirm the constant-power operating envelope achieved using the new flux-weakening control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.1987.4504966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4504948/04504966.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4504966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504948","startPage":"681","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flux-Weakening Regime Operation of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4504966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flux-Weakening Regime Operation of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4504966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"IA-23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux-Weakening Regime Operation of an Interior Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n4-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04217S","chronDate":"July  1987","isNumber":"4504948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"539","articleId":"4504966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4504977,"authors":[{"name":"Ralph H.

Fast reversal from motoring to regenerative braking capability is demonstrated experimentally.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.1987.4505024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505008","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1028","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/4505008/04505024.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of a Controlled-Current PWM Rectifier-Inverter Link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of a Controlled-Current PWM Rectifier-Inverter Link","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"IA-23","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of a Controlled-Current PWM Rectifier-Inverter Link","sourcePdf":"TIA-vIA-23-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03093S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"4505008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4505024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4505192,"authors":[{"name":"Archer S.

In order to benefit from both sources of information, several pansharpening methods have been developed to produce a multispectral image at the spatial resolution of the panchromatic band. The aim of this paper is to suggest a novel approach to the pansharpening problem within a Bayesian framework. This Bayesian data fusion (BDF) method relies on statistical relationships between the various spectral bands and the panchromatic band without suffering from restricting modeling hypotheses. Furthermore, it allows the user to weight the spectral and panchromatic information with respect to either visual or quantitative criteria, which leads to adaptable results according to users' needs and study areas. The performance of this approach was compared to existing methods based on markedly different subset images from very high spatial resolution IKONOS images. Results showed that BDF yielded the highest spectral consistency. Furthermore, small details were adequately added to the pansharpened images with little artifact as compared to those created using wavelet-based methods. Finally, the method was fast and easy to implement owing to its straightforward formulation. As it does not have any intrinsic limitations on the type of data to be processed or the number of bands to be merged, it also appears to be very promising for optical/SAR or hyperspectral image fusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4524010/04505280.pdf","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.917131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.917131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4524010","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Data Fusion for Adaptable Image Pansharpening","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Spatial resolution","Optical sensors","Principal component analysis","Satellites","Image resolution","Optical saturation","Image sensors","Information resources","Multispectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image fusion","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian data fusion","adaptable image pansharpening","optical Earth observation satellites","panchromatic sensor","spatial resolution multispectral sensors","multispectral image","IKONOS images","wavelet-based methods","SAR","hyperspectral image fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brovey","data merging","IKONOS","intensity\u2013hue\u2013saturation (IHS)","principal component analysis (PCA)","very high spatial resolution (VHR)","wavelets"]},{"kwd":["Brovey","data merging","IKONOS","intensity\u00bfhue\u00bfsaturation (IHS)","principal component analysis (PCA)","very high spatial resolution (VHR)","wavelets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Data Fusion for Adaptable Image Pansharpening","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9999477","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Data Fusion for Adaptable Image Pansharpening","sourcePdf":"46tgrs06-fasbender.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095771S","chronDate":"June  2008","isNumber":"4524010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"152","articleId":"4505280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4505282,"authors":[{"name":"Diganta Kumar Sarma","affiliation":["Kohima Science College, Nagaland, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4524010/4505282/4505282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Diganta Kumar Sarma received the M.Sc. degree from Gauhati University, Assam, India.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the Department of Physics, Kohima Science College, Nagaland, India, under a research program sponsored by the Indian Space Research Organization.

The polarization-corrected temperature <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$(\\hbox{PCT}_{85})$</tex></formula> calculated from the 85.5-GHz channels is also considered as one of the inputs along with the nine channel Tb values. This model is applicable over the region between <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$0^{\\circ}{-}30^{\\circ}\\ \\hbox{N}$</tex> </formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$65^{\\circ}{-}100^{\\circ}\\ \\hbox{E}$</tex></formula>. For this purpose, an artificial neural network is utilized. The collocated precipitation radar (PR) near-surface rain rates as given by a 2A25 data product is considered as a target value. The methodology consists of the separation of land and ocean pixels, the separation of stratiform and convective pixels over land/ocean, and the selection of important features (inputs) for the multilayer perceptron network by the feature selection technique for each group. For the separation of land/ocean pixels, the Tb values of the 10.65-GHz vertical channel are utilized. The <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex>$\\hbox{PCT}_{85}$</tex></formula> values are utilized to separate the stratiform and convective pixels both over land and ocean. The rain retrieval from the developed model is validated with TRMM PR. Overall result shows the better agreement of the model-retrieved rain rate with the PR observation compared to the TMI (2A12) rain rate particularly over land. The rain retrieved from the developed model is further validated with Doppler weather radar. A reasonably good agreement is observed between these two estimations. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10002966","volume":"46","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4505282/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Artificial-Neural-Network-Based Integrated Regional Model for Rain Retrieval Over Land and Ocean","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Artificial-Neural-Network-Based Integrated Regional Model for Rain Retrieval Over Land and Ocean","sourcePdf":"46tgrs06-sarma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109684S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4524010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4524010","articleId":"4505282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4505310,"authors":[{"name":"Sally Adee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.R.

First, by employing the WPT in the spatial frequency domain, the real and imaginary parts of the complex noisy interferogram are decomposed, respectively, and the wavelet coefficients are obtained. Then, for these coefficients, Wiener filtering is adopted to remove noise. This scheme can filter noise adaptively according to the local noise level, without requiring any a priori information. By using a simulated noisy interferogram and two ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar C-band interferograms, the performance of this scheme, in terms of noise reduction and fringes preservation, is reported and compared with other filter algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10115241","htmlLink":"/document/4505316/","displayDocTitle":"Noise Reduction in Interferograms Using the Wavelet Packet Transform and Wiener Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Reduction in Interferograms Using the Wavelet Packet Transform and Wiener Filtering","sourcePdf":"05lgrs03-zha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07118S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4567424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4567424","articleId":"4505316","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4505327,"authors":[{"name":"Jiuxiang Dong","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4982906/4505327/4505327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiuxiang Dong received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection","abstract":"There has been great interest in developing methodologies that are capable of dealing with imprecision and uncertainty. The large amount of research currently being carried out in fuzzy and rough sets is representative of this. Many deep relationships have been established, and recent studies have concluded as to the complementary nature of the two methodologies. Therefore, it is desirable to extend and hybridize the underlying concepts to deal with additional aspects of data imperfection. Such developments offer a high degree of flexibility and provide robust solutions and advanced tools for data analysis. Fuzzy-rough set-based feature (FS) selection has been shown to be highly useful at reducing data dimensionality but possesses several problems that render it ineffective for large datasets. This paper proposes three new approaches to fuzzy-rough FS-based on fuzzy similarity relations. In particular, a fuzzy extension to crisp discernibility matrices is proposed and utilized. Initial experimentation shows that the methods greatly reduce dimensionality while preserving classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10794831","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New Approaches to Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approaches to Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jensen-924209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078657S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5175617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"379","articleId":"4505335","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4505340,"authors":[{"name":"Zsofia Lendek","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4982906/4505340/4505340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zs\u00f3fia Lendek received the M.Sc. degree and the Postgraduate Diploma in control engineering from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2009.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technology.

It is well known that the stability of these consequent models does not ensure the stability of the overall fuzzy system. Therefore, several stability conditions have been developed for TS fuzzy systems. We study a special class of nonlinear dynamic systems that can be decomposed into cascaded subsystems, which are represented as TS fuzzy models. We analyze the stability of the overall TS system based on the stability of the subsystems and prove that the stability of the subsystems implies the stability of the overall system. The main benefit of this approach is that it relaxes the conditions imposed when the system is globally analyzed, thereby solving some of the feasibility problems. Another benefit is that by using this approach, the dimension of the associated linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem can be reduced. For naturally distributed applications, such as multiagent systems, the construction and tuning of a centralized observer may not be feasible. Therefore, we also extend the cascaded approach to the observer design and use fuzzy observers to individually estimate the states of these subsystems. A theoretical proof of stability and simulation examples are presented. The results show that the distributed observer achieves the same performance as the centralized one, while leading to increased modularity, reduced complexity, lower computational costs, and easier tuning. Applications of such cascaded systems include multiagent systems, distributed process control, and hierarchical large-scale systems.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924353","startPage":"641","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4982906/04505340.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of Cascaded Fuzzy Systems and Observers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505340/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability of Cascaded Fuzzy Systems and Observers","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4505340/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10667285","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of Cascaded Fuzzy Systems and Observers","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lendek-924353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159989S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4982906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4982906","articleId":"4505340","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4505350,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5175617/4505350/4505350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuo Tanaka (S'87-M'91) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in systems science from Tokyo Institute of Technology, in 1990.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo.

The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. First, we propose a polynomial fuzzy modeling and control framework that is more general and effective than the well-known T--S fuzzy modeling and control. Secondly, we obtain stability and stabilizability conditions of the polynomial fuzzy systems based on polynomial Lyapunov functions that contain quadratic Lyapunov functions as a special case. Hence, the stability and stabilizability conditions presented in this paper are more general and relaxed than those of the existing LMI-based approaches to T-S fuzzy modeling and control. Moreover, the derived stability and stabilizability conditions are represented in terms of SOS and can be numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, a number of analysis and design examples are provided. The first example shows that the SOS approach renders more relaxed stability results than those of both the LMI-based approaches and a polynomial system approach. The second example presents an extensive application of the SOS approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach. The last example is a design exercise that demonstrates the viability of the SOS-based approach to synthesizing a stabilizing controller.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5175617/04505350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175617","startPage":"911","endPage":"922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sum-of-Squares Approach to Modeling and Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems With Polynomial Fuzzy Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sum-of-Squares Approach to Modeling and Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems With Polynomial Fuzzy Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10794840","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4505350/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sum-of-Squares Approach to Modeling and Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems With Polynomial Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-tanaka-924341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087293S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5175617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"5175617","articleId":"4505350","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4505352,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Shi Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4639420/4505352/4505352-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chung-Shi Tseng (M'01\u2013SM'05) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1984, the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, in 1987, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Tsing-Hua University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, in 2001.","He is currently a Full Professor at Ming Hsin University of Science and Technology, Hsin-Feng, Taiwan.

This paper introduces a model-based approach for the fully automatic segmentation of the whole heart (four chambers, myocardium, and great vessels) from 3-D CT images. Model adaptation is done by progressively increasing the degrees-of-freedom of the allowed deformations. This improves convergence as well as segmentation accuracy. The heart is first localized in the image using a 3-D implementation of the generalized Hough transform. Pose misalignment is corrected by matching the model to the image making use of a global similarity transformation. The complex initialization of the multicompartment mesh is then addressed by assigning an affine transformation to each anatomical region of the model. Finally, a deformable adaptation is performed to accurately match the boundaries of the patient's anatomy. A mean surface-to-surface error of 0.82 mm was measured in a leave-one-out quantitative validation carried out on 28 images. Moreover, the piecewise affine transformation introduced for mesh initialization and adaptation shows better interphase and interpatient shape variability characterization than commonly used principal component analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185695","pubMedId":"18753041","htmlLink":"/document/4505365/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Model-Based Segmentation of the Heart in CT Images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Model-Based Segmentation of the Heart in CT Images","sourcePdf":"27tmi09-ecabert.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110466S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4608888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"272","xplore-issue":"4608888","articleId":"4505365","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4505368,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National University of Athens, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4639420/4505368/4505368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Hung Chen (S\u201907) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1979.

Thus, the consequent part of the proposed FLNFN model is a nonlinear combination of input variables. An online learning algorithm, which consists of structure learning and parameter learning, is also presented. The structure learning depends on the entropy measure to determine the number of fuzzy rules. The parameter learning, based on the gradient descent method, can adjust the shape of the membership function and the corresponding weights of the FLNN.

Experimental results empirically show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of convergence speed, solution quality, and solution stability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9992348","pubMedId":"18558539","htmlLink":"/document/4505375/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization With Wavelet Mutation and Its Industrial Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization With Wavelet Mutation and Its Industrial Applications","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb03-ling.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182331S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4522590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4522590","articleId":"4505375","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4505385,"authors":[{"name":"Song-Yul Choe","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4505383/4505385/4505385-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Song-Yul (Ben) Choe received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany, in 1991.","He was a Program Manager and a Research Professor in the Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, Mississippi State University, where he was engaged in research on the fuel cell and the advanced intelligent vehicle.

Thus, a dc/dc converter is required to boost the output voltage of these power systems. Furthermore, the terminal characteristics are dependent on loads and operating conditions of the fuel cell system. The continuously changing power demand of an electric load requires dynamically replenishing the air and fuel, by properly maintaining humidity in the cell and efficiently rejecting the heat produced. These factors present important challenges for the design of reliable and durable power systems. We present new dynamic models for a fuel cell system and a pulsewidth modulation dc/dc converter with associated controls and integration. The model for the system consists of three subsystems that include an PEM fuel cell stack, an air supply, and a thermal system. Four different controllers were designed to control the air, the coolant, and the output voltage of the converter, and to optimize the power flow between the fuel cell and the output capacitor. The integrated model with its controls was tested using a real-time simulator that reduced computational time and facilitated the analysis of the interactions between loads and the fuel cell components and also allowed the optimization of a power control strategy. The responses of a static and dynamic load show that the power controls proposed can coordinate two energy sources, resulting in improved dynamics and efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4505383/04505385.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2007.914313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2007.914313","startPage":"669","endPage":"680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Simulator for a PEM Fuel Cell System With a PWM DC/DC Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505385/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Simulator for a PEM Fuel Cell System With a PWM DC/DC Converter","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505385/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9944421","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Simulator for a PEM Fuel Cell System With a PWM DC/DC Converter","sourcePdf":"23tec02-choe.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090447S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4505383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4505383","articleId":"4505385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4505391,"authors":[{"name":"John Hetzer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["John Hetzer received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in engineering from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, Milwaukee, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He is currently with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee."]},"firstName":"John","lastName":"Hetzer","id":"38093690800"},{"name":"David C.

This paper develops a model to include the WECS in the ED problem, and in addition to the classic economic dispatch factors, factors to account for both overestimation and underestimation of available wind power are included. With the stochastic wind speed characterization based on the Weibull probability density function, the optimization problem is numerically solved for a scenario involving two conventional and two wind-powered generators. Optimal solutions are presented for various values of the input parameters, and these solutions demonstrate that the allocation of system generation capacity may be influenced by multipliers related to the risk of overestimation and to the cost of underestimation of available wind power.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4505383/04505391.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2007.914171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2007.914171","startPage":"603","endPage":"611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Economic Dispatch Model Incorporating Wind Power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505391/","displayDocTitle":"An Economic Dispatch Model Incorporating Wind Power","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505391/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9944427","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Economic Dispatch Model Incorporating Wind Power","sourcePdf":"23tec02-hetzer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06117S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4505383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"680","xplore-issue":"4505383","articleId":"4505391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4505394,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Levi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4505383/4505394/4505394-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emil Levi (S'89\u2013M'92\u2013SM'99) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1986 and 1990, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1982 to 1992, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia.

Such machines are often with concentrated winding in which case, certain low-order stator current harmonics are injected to provide torque enhancement. Also, a multimotor drive system can be realized by connecting a number of multiphase machines in series, using phase transposition while supplying the whole system from a single multiphase VSI. In both situations, it is important to know the limits of the inverter operation in the linear modulation region. This paper develops a simple method that enables analytical determination of the boundaries of the linear modulation region for all multiphase inverters with a prime number of phases. The limits are independent of the actual pulse width modulation (PWM) method utilized, and are equally applicable to both carrier-based and space vector PWM techniques.

This paper considers modeling induction machines using phase variables in a voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) formulation. Specifically, three VBR models are proposed wherein the rotor electrical subsystem is modeled using flux linkages as state variables expressed in the qd reference frame. The stator electrical dynamics are represented in abc phase coordinates that enable direct interface of the machine model to an external network. Such a direct interface is advantageous when the machine is fed from a power electronic converter and/or when the modeling is carried out using circuit-based simulators. Computer studies of an induction machine demonstrate that the proposed VBR models achieve a 740% improvement in computational efficiency as compared with the traditional coupled-circuit phase-domain model.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.918601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4505383/04505399.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.918601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505383","startPage":"382","endPage":"392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Induction Machines Using a Voltage-Behind-Reactance Formulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Induction Machines Using a Voltage-Behind-Reactance Formulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9944436","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4505399/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Induction Machines Using a Voltage-Behind-Reactance Formulation","sourcePdf":"23tec02-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133964S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4505383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4505383","articleId":"4505399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4505406,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d3scar Lopez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4505400/4505406/4505406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d3scar L\u00f3pez (M'05) was born in Spain, in 1975.

Besides, multilevel converter technology permits the achievement of high power ratings with voltage limited devices. Multilevel multiphase technology combines the benefits of both technologies, but new modulation techniques must be developed in order to take advantage of multilevel multiphase converters. In this paper, a novel space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) algorithm for multilevel multiphase voltage source converters is presented. This algorithm is the result of the two main contributions of this paper: the demonstration that a multilevel multiphase modulator can be realized from a two-level multiphase modulator, and the development of a new two-level multiphase SVPWM algorithm. The multiphase SVPWM algorithm presented in this paper can be applied to most multilevel topologies; it has low computational complexity and it is suitable for hardware implementations. Finally, the algorithm was implemented in a low-cost field-programmable gate array and it was tested in a laboratory with a real prototype using a five-level five-phase inverter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel Multiphase Space Vector PWM Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.918466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4505400/04505406.pdf","startPage":"1933","endPage":"1942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.918466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Multiphase Space Vector PWM Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4505406/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9944369","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Multiphase Space Vector PWM Algorithm","sourcePdf":"55tie05-lopez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097242S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4505400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"4505400","articleId":"4505406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4505421,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabing Hu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4603059/4505421/4505421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiabing Hu (S\u201905) was born in Luan, China.

Based on the developed model, a new definition of instantaneous reactive power is introduced, and an accurate mathematical model of the instantaneous active and reactive powers at different locations of the VSC is derived. To avoid the use of band-trap filter for decomposing the positive- and negative-sequence dq components of current and voltage, a new control scheme with multifrequency proportional-resonant controller in the stationary alphabeta frame is employed to improve the steady state and dynamic response under generalized unbalanced operation conditions. Simulation and experimental studies with various factors were conducted and compared under different types of unbalanced conditions. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme in the stationary alphabeta frame provides sufficiently steady-state tracking capability for ac input current, and a better transient response in compensation for wide-range generalized unbalanced operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2008.921468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4603059/04505421.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.921468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"903","endPage":"913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Sourced Converters Under Generalized Unbalanced Operation Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Sourced Converters Under Generalized Unbalanced Operation Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505421/","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4505421/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177431","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of Grid-Connected Voltage-Sourced Converters Under Generalized Unbalanced Operation Conditions","sourcePdf":"23tec03-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054256S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4603059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4603059","articleId":"4505421","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4505427,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The idea behind using negative correlation learning in conjunction with the bagging/boosting algorithm is to facilitate interaction and cooperation among NNs during their training. Both NegBagg and NegBoost use a constructive approach to automatically determine the number of hidden neurons for NNs. NegBoost also uses the constructive approach to automatically determine the number of NNs for the ensemble. The two algorithms have been tested on a number of benchmark problems in machine learning and NNs, including Australian credit card assessment, breast cancer, diabetes, glass, heart disease, letter recognition, satellite, soybean, and waveform problems. The experimental results show that NegBagg and NegBoost require a small number of training epochs to produce compact NN ensembles with good generalization. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.922055","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4522590/04505427.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.922055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bagging and Boosting Negatively Correlated Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bagging and Boosting Negatively Correlated Neural Networks","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9980938","pubMedId":"18558541","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4505427/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bagging and Boosting Negatively Correlated Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb03-islam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214485S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4522590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4522590","articleId":"4505427","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4505430,"authors":[{"name":"Ajibola Ajayi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4527042/4505430/4505430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajibola Ajayi (S\u201907) was born in Lagos, Nigeria, on April 18, 1982.

The considered transients have frequencies between a few kilohertz to a few megahertz with risetimes 0.1-10 mus. Comparative simulations using TL equations and full- wave Maxwell's equations are carried out in the paper, and the solutions to both the equations are based on the finite-difference time-domain method. It is found that TL solutions are sufficiently accurate for lightning transient analysis of buried wires. It is also claimed that the TL approach remains valid for all transients having frequencies lower than those of lightning. TL solutions are computationally efficient, particularly when dealing with distributed power and railway systems. The TL approach is valid as long as the transverse electromagnetic mode (TEM) is dominant. However, other modes of propagation, classified as antenna modes, might be present depending upon the type of excitation source, its location, frequency, and the associated media. A possible approximate formula for the frequency above which the validity of TL solutions for buried systems is questionable is proposed based on the concept of penetration depth of fields into the soil. Discussions presented in the paper could motivate the application of TL solutions for electromagnetic transient analyses of the buried conductors of power, railway, and telecommunication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Choice Between Transmission Line Equations and Full-Wave Maxwell's Equations for Transient Analysis of Buried Wires","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.919040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4527042/04505436.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.919040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4527042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Choice Between Transmission Line Equations and Full-Wave Maxwell's Equations for Transient Analysis of Buried Wires","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4505436/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10002944","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Choice Between Transmission Line Equations and Full-Wave Maxwell's Equations for Transient Analysis of Buried Wires","sourcePdf":"50temc02-theethayi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089515S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4527042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4527042","articleId":"4505436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4505462,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"38090616700"},{"name":"Hyojeong Shin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyojeong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37552709100"},{"name":"Hojung Cha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hojung","lastName":"Cha","id":"37290910900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3157-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505462","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":160,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":967},"abstract":"As the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) becomes widespread, node density tends to increase. This poses a new challenge for medium access control (MAC) protocol design. Although traditional MAC protocols achieve low-power operation, they use only a single channel which limits their performance. Several multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs have been recently proposed. One of the key observations is that these protocols are less energy efficient than single-channel MAC protocols under light traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient multichannel MAC protocol, Y-MAC, for WSNs. Our goal is to achieve both high performance and energy efficiency under diverse traffic conditions. In contrast to most of previous multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs, we implemented Y-MAC on a real sensor node platform and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that Y-MAC is energy efficient and maintains high performance under high-traffic conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Wireless sensor networks","Access protocols","Sampling methods","Sleep","Telecommunication traffic","Radio transceivers","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","medium access control protocol","multichannel MAC protocol","network traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Networks","Medium Access Control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2008.27","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505448/4505449/04505462.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2008.27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Y-MAC: An Energy-Efficient Multi-channel MAC Protocol for Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Y-MAC: An Energy-Efficient Multi-channel MAC Protocol for Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505462/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505462/","accessionNumber":"9962844","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Y-MAC: An Energy-Efficient Multi-channel MAC Protocol for Dense Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"3157a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075632S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505448","isNumber":"4505449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505448","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"4505449","articleId":"4505462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4505463,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Goel","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Goel","id":"37269720700"},{"name":"Sanjeev Khanna","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Khanna","id":"37268596200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3157-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505463","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"abstract":"Multicast is a fundamental communication operation in wireless sensor networks whereby a source sensor transmits its information to a relevant subset of sensors in the network.

An interesting aspect of our result is that it shows that the advantage of coding remains bounded by a constant even when compared to a multicast scheme without coding that is restricted to do only point-to-point transmissions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505448/4505449/04505463.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2008.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2008.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505449","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Network Coding Advantage for Wireless Multicast in Euclidean Space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Wireless sensor networks","Throughput","Broadcasting","Information processing","Communication networks","Engineering profession","Encoding","Linear programming","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","wireless multicast","Euclidean space","wireless sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Network Coding Advantage for Wireless Multicast in Euclidean Space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945459","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Network Coding Advantage for Wireless Multicast in Euclidean Space","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"3157a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085064S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505448","isNumber":"4505449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505448","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4505449","articleId":"4505463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4505465,"authors":[{"name":"Neal Patwari","affiliation":["Sensing and Processing Across Networks Lab ECE Department, University of Utah, Salt Lake, USA"],"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Patwari","id":"37284666000"},{"name":"Piyush Agrawal","affiliation":["Sensing and Processing Across Networks Lab ECE Department, University of Utah, Salt Lake, USA"],"firstName":"Piyush","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37586725000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3157-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505465","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","Radio frequency","Tomography","Fading","Spread spectrum communication","Propagation losses","Mesh networks","Analysis of variance","Image sensors","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","radio networks","tomography","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlated shadowing","RF tomography","radio channel shadowing","real-world shadowing losses","network connectivity","sensor self-localization change","localization information","link correlations","tomographic imaging","pairwise RSS measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["joint path loss","radio propagation","channel model","fading","signal strength","localization","connectivity","RF imaging"]}],"abstract":"Unlike current models for radio channel shadowing indicate, real-world shadowing losses on different links in a network are not independent. The correlations have both detrimental and beneficial impacts on sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networks. First, the probability of network connectivity reduces when link shadowing correlations are considered. Next, the variance bounds for sensor self-localization change, and provide the insight that algorithms must infer localization information from link correlations in order to avoid significant degradation from correlated shadowing. Finally, a major benefit is that shadowing correlations between links enable the tomographic imaging of an environment from pairwise RSS measurements. This paper applies measurement-based models, and measurements themselves, to analyze and to verify both the benefits and drawbacks of correlated link shadowing.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2008.7","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505448/4505449/04505465.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2008.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Correlated Shadowing: Connectivity, Localization, and RF Tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505465/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Correlated Shadowing: Connectivity, Localization, and RF Tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962846","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505465/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Correlated Shadowing: Connectivity, Localization, and RF Tomography","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"3157a082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082171S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505448","isNumber":"4505449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505448","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4505449","articleId":"4505465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4505476,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Obst","affiliation":["CSIRO Information and Communications Technology Centre, North Ryde, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Obst","id":"37888530200"},{"name":"X.

In this domain, one of the main problems is a provision of mine specific anomaly detection, with cyclical (moving) instead offlatline (static) alarm threshold levels. An additional practical difficulty in modelling a specific mine is the lack of fully labelled data of normal and abnormal situations. We present an approach addressing these difficulties based on echo state networks learning mine specific anomalies when only normal data is available. Echo state networks utilize incremental updates driven by new sensor readings, thus enabling a detection of anomalies at any time during the sensor network operation. We evaluate this approach against a benchmark - Bayesian network based anomaly detection, and observe that the quality of the overall predictions is comparable to the benchmark. However, the echo state networks maintain the same level of predictive accuracy for data from multiple sources. Therefore, the ability of echo state networks to model dynamical systems make this approach more suitable for anomaly detection and predictions in sensor networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505449","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505448/4505449/04505476.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2008.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2008.35","startPage":"219","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Echo State Networks for Anomaly Detection in Underground Coal Mines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505476/","displayDocTitle":"Using Echo State Networks for Anomaly Detection in Underground Coal Mines","htmlLink":"/document/4505476/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9962854","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Echo State Networks for Anomaly Detection in Underground Coal Mines","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"3157a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066719S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505448","isNumber":"4505449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505448","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4505449","articleId":"4505476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4505478,"authors":[{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37308405500"},{"name":"Peng Ning","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ning","id":"37269721200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3157-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505478","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":474,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1948},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505478","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","Wireless sensor networks","Application software","Public key cryptography","Cryptographic protocols","IP networks","Web and internet services","Software libraries","Software packages","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","software performance evaluation","telecommunication computing","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["configurable library","elliptic curve cryptography","wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography","security services","Internet","TinyECC evaluation","software package"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network security","public key cryptography","ECC","TinyECC"]}],"abstract":"Public key cryptography (PKC) has been the enabling technology underlying many security services and protocols in traditional networks such as the Internet. In the context of wireless sensor networks, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), one of the most efficient types of PKC, is being investigated to provide PKC support in sensor network applications so that the existing PKC-based solutions can be exploited. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TinyECC, a configurable library for ECC operations in wireless sensor networks. The primary objective of TinyECC is to provide a ready-to-use, publicly available software package for ECC-based PKC operations that can be flexibly configured and integrated into sensor network applications. TinyECC provides a number of optimization switches, which can turn specific optimizations on or off based on developers' needs. Different combinations of the optimizations have different execution time and resource consumptions, giving developers great flexibility in integrating TinyECC into sensor network applications. This paper also reports the experimental evaluation of TinyECC on several common sensor platforms, including MICAz, Tmote Sky, and Imotel. The evaluation results show the impacts of individual optimizations on the execution time and resource consumptions, and give the most computationally efficient and the most storage efficient configuration of TinyECC.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2008.47","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (ipsn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4505448/4505449/04505478.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2008.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TinyECC: A Configurable Library for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"TinyECC: A Configurable Library for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962856","htmlLink":"/document/4505478/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TinyECC: A Configurable Library for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"3157a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057163S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505448","isNumber":"4505449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505448","citationCount":"474","xplore-issue":"4505449","articleId":"4505478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4505481,"authors":[{"name":"Prabal Dutta","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prabal","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37429446700"},{"name":"Mark Feldmeier","affiliation":["The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Feldmeier","id":"37947268700"},{"name":"Joseph Paradiso","affiliation":["The Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Paradiso","id":"37327727500"},{"name":"David Culler","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Culler","id":"37279605700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3157-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505481","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Monitoring","Microcontrollers","Pulse modulation","Watthour meters","Wire","Real time systems","Energy measurement","Switching frequency","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcontrollers","power meters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy metering","augmenting switching regulators","real-time monitoring","iCount","built-in switching regulator","load current","switching frequency","externally-clocked counter","microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy meter","low power","current accumulation"]}],"abstract":"We present iCount, a new energy meter design.

Our particular implementation exhibits a maximum error of less than plusmn20% over five decades of current draw, a resolution exceeding 1 muJ, a read latency of 15 mus, and a power overhead that ranges from 1% when the node is in standby to 0.01 % when the node is active, for a typical workload.

This paper presents a design stage method for assessing performance reliability of systems with competing time-variant responses due to components with uncertain degradation rates. Herein, system performance measures (e.g. selected responses) are related to their critical levels by time dependent limit-state functions. System failure is defined as the non-conformance of any response, and hence unions of the multiple failure regions are formed. For discrete time, set theory establishes the minimum union size needed to identify a true incremental failure region that emerges from a safe region. A cumulative failure distribution function is built by summing incremental failure probabilities. A practical implementation of the theory is manifest through evaluating probabilities by Monte Carlo simulation. Error analysis suggests ways to predict and minimize errors. An electrical temperature controller shows the details of the method, and the potential of the approach. It is shown that the proposed method provides a more realistic way to predict performance reliability than either worst-case, or simple average-based approaches that are available in the open literature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System performance","Degradation","Time measurement","Performance loss","Set theory","Predictive models","Statistical distributions","Random variables","Loss measurement","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","Monte Carlo methods","reliability","reliability theory","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance reliability","multiple degradation paths","systems performance reliability","design stage method","uncertain degradation rates","time dependent limit-state functions","system failure","discrete time","set theory","cumulative failure distribution function","Monte Carlo simulation","error analysis","electrical temperature controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Component degradation","Monte Carlo simulation","random environmental conditions","set theory","systems performance reliability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TR.2008.920864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/4538180/04505534.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2008.920864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Sample-Based Approach to Predict System Performance Reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Sample-Based Approach to Predict System Performance Reliability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505534/","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505534/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10050604","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Sample-Based Approach to Predict System Performance Reliability","sourcePdf":"57tr02-son.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069262S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"4538180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4538180","articleId":"4505534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4505575,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Bayati poudeh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Majlesi Branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Bayati","lastName":"poudeh","id":"38093677800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-950038-8-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-962150-0-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505575","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505575","abstract":"The Sub-Synchronous Oscillation (SSO) phenomenon in the power system with compensated transmission line, is maybe occurred. The SSO phenomenon of turbine-generator electromechanical interaction with series capacitor has historically been a terrible problem in power systems. In this paper, an adaptive control method, was used to damp these oscillations. In this control method, the performance of the exciter was improved. By using genetic algorithm and a PID controller, the output voltage of the exciter was controlled adaptively. This new control method is a Model Reference Adaptive Control method (MRAC) based on the combination of PID control and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Genetic algorithm is employed to find the best values for PID controller's parameters in a very short time. With this hybrid controller, mitigation of the sub-synchronous oscillations is done better.

The conventional pseudo-inverse formulation requires excessive computation time for on-line or real time application. To effectively accomplish following goals: excavation task execution, joint limit control, and obstacle avoidance at the same time, conventional Newton-iteration scheme was replaced by a recurrent neural network algorithm in this study. The recurrent neural network was implemented for better kinematics control of the excavator with obstacle avoidance capability. In automated excavation environments, potential dangers exist if a worker is within the workspace of the excavator. When an obstacle is detected by a sensor, accidents can be easily prevented by halting the excavation process using a simple fail-safe algorithm. However, it would be more desirable to handle the unforeseen obstacles intelligently on-line while continuing the excavation task instead of stopping. For excavators, an obstacle can be classified into two categories. The first category includes obstacles on the ground such as trees, workers, and buildings. The second category of obstacles includes underground obstructions such as tree roots, boulders and etc. This paper focuses on the first category of these obstacles and was written to meet the emphasis requirements of avoiding obstacles on the ground for the excavator.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMA.2008.4505593","startPage":"585","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Smart Manufacturing Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMA.2008.4505593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505541","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Smart Manufacturing Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4497249/4505541/04505593.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Excavators Using a Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505593/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Excavators Using a Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505593/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10028922","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Excavators Using a Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Goyangi, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICSMA08-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063825S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4497249","isNumber":"4505541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4497249","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4505541","articleId":"4505593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICROS, Komma","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4505597,"authors":[{"name":"Hyoung-Seok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292781200"},{"name":"Byung-Ryong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Ryong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293393600"},{"name":"Tuong-Quan Vo","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tuong-Quan","lastName":"Vo","id":"37585700500"},{"name":"Quoc-Bao Truong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Quoc-Bao","lastName":"Truong","id":"37679539400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-950038-8-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-962150-0-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4505597","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505597","abstract":"Recently, the technologies of mobile robots have been growing rapidly in the fields such as cleaning robot, explosive ordnance disposal robot, patrol robot, and etc. However, the researches about the autonomous underwater robots have not been done so much, and they still remain at the low level of technology.

Both of the critical speed and critical amplitude are reduced with the suitable damping coefficient. A novel Linear Magnetic Actuator (LMA) is investigated and used to move the outer damper of the CSFD. The experiment results illustrate basically the concept of electromagnetic effect as well as the interaction force between electromagnet and permanent magnet.

The discrete wavelet transform extract signal features by wavelet coefficients of one-lead ECG signal. Using the proposed approach on 35 normal subjects and 10 arrhythmia patients, 100% verification rate was obtained for normal subjects and 81% verification rate for arrhythmia patients. Furthermore, the performance of the ECG verification system was evaluated by the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). The FAR was 0.83% and FRR was 0.86%for a database containing only 35 normal subjects. When 10 arrhythmia patients were added into the database, the FAR became 12.50% and the FRR 5.11%.

Since the accuracy and efficiency of route guidance depend on the accuracy of the traffic conditions, the route guidance system needs to include more variables in calculation, such as real time traffic flows and allowable vehicle speeds. As variables considered by the route guidance system increase, the cost to compute multiplies. As handheld devices have limited resources, it is not feasible to use them to compute the exact optimal solutions by some well- known algorithm, such as the Dijkstra's algorithm, which is usually used to find the shortest path with a map of reasonable numbers of vertices. To solve this problem, we propose to use the genetic algorithm to alleviate the rising computational cost. We use the genetic algorithm to find the shortest time in driving with diverse scenarios of real traffic conditions and varying vehicle speeds. The effectiveness of the genetic algorithm is clearly demonstrated when applied on a real map of modern city with very large vertex numbers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4505758/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9962781","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4505758/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Shortest Driving Time in Intelligent Transportation Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm for Shortest Driving Time in Intelligent Transportation Systems","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"3134a402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061437S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4505670","isNumber":"4505671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4505670","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4505671","articleId":"4505758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4505797,"authors":[{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Nonlinear Sci. of Chinese Minist. of Educ., Fudan University, Shanghai"],"firstName":"Tianping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4505797","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4505797","abstract":"In this note, we point out that the results given in the paper by Wu and Cui (2007) can be obtained by using the results given in Lu (2003).

Rayleigh flat fading channels. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the general distortion analysis of vector quantizers to deal with complex source variables. Necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee a concise high-resolution distortion analysis in the complex domain is presented. Second, as an application of the proposed complex distortion analysis, tight lower bounds on the capacity loss due to the finite-rate channel quantization are provided for MIMO systems employing a fixed number of equal power spatial beams. Based on the obtained closed-form analytical results, it is shown that the system capacity loss decreases exponentially as the ratio of the quantization rate to the total degrees of freedom of the channel state information to be quantized. Moreover, MIMO CSI-quantizers using mismatched codebooks that are only optimized for high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low-SNR regimes are also investigated to quantify the penalties incurred by the use of mismatched codebooks. In addition, the analysis is extended to deal with MIMO systems using multi-mode spatial multiplexing transmission schemes with finite-rate CSI feedback. Finally, numerical and simulation results are presented which confirm the tightness of the derived theoretical distortion bounds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems Using Limited Feedback Transmit Precoding Schemes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04506630.pdf","startPage":"2886","endPage":"2901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4506630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4506630/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems Using Limited Feedback Transmit Precoding Schemes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4506630/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10058996","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO Systems Using Limited Feedback Transmit Precoding Schemes","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-zheng-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04715S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4506630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509305,"authors":[{"name":"Brian L.

Thus the surface temperature profile of VLSI ICs has become critical information in chip design flow. for fast computation of surface temperature profile, power blurring (PB) method has been developed. This method can be applied to simulations with high spatial resolution, which have been prohibitively expensive with conventional methods. Comparative case studies with different levels of resolution illustrate that not only localized small hot spots can be overlooked but even the average chip temperature can be underestimated, and hence the necessity of thermal simulation with high spatial resolution.

A thermal test chip was designed to assist the thermal engineer in answering critical thermal packaging or material questions. It has a standard heat source with integrated temperature sensors in a format that can handle both wire bond and bump chip configurations in a scaleable array size. This allows a single wafer to supply various array sizes to meet changing requirements. The key requirements for a thermal test chip are: \u2022 Maximum possible heating area relative to chip size \u2022 Uniform temperature profile across heating area \u2022 Low temperature coefficient for heating source \u2022 Temperature sensor in center of chip \u2022 Simple-to-use temperature sensor(s) \u2022 Multiple temperature sensors for a temperature profile across chip surface \u2022 Kelvin Connections (i.e., 4-wire connections) for improved measurement accuracy \u2022 Chip size that closely approximates the chip being simulated.

Two distinct algorithmic directions can be distinguished in electro-thermal simulation: the simulator coupling and the simultaneous iteration or direct method. In our view the direct method is well suited for electro-thermal simulation of analog circuit blocks while simulator coupling can be used to implement logi-thermal simulation. In case of complex designs containing digital and analog blocks the two approaches can also be combined. Ideally thermal, electro-thermal and logi-thermal simulation of a circuit is performed already in the phase of conceptual design when only a rough idea exists about the final physical realization of the circuit. In any case, effect of the thermal boundary conditions of the die+package, cooling via the electrical connections to the die and the granularity of the simulation should be carefully considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electro-thermal and Logi-thermal Simulators aimed at the Temperature-aware Design of Complex Integrated Circuits","publicationTitle":"2008 Twenty-fourth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","doi":"10.1109/STHERM.2008.4509369","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Twenty-fourth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4476516/4509347/04509369.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STHERM.2008.4509369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electro-thermal and Logi-thermal Simulators aimed at the Temperature-aware Design of Complex Integrated Circuits","conferenceDate":"16-20 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509369/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9964371","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electro-thermal and Logi-thermal Simulators aimed at the Temperature-aware Design of Complex Integrated Circuits","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SEMI-THERM-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091451S","chronDate":"16-20 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4476516","isNumber":"4509347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4476516","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4509347","articleId":"4509369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4509387,"authors":[{"name":"Cathy Biber","affiliation":["Biber Thermal Design, Limited, Portland, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Cathy","lastName":"Biber","id":"37612992600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2123-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2124-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1065-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4509387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":816},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Temperature","Heat sinks","Space heating","Voltage","Performance analysis","Electronic packaging thermal management","Curve fitting","Lighting","Light sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","light emitting diodes","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED thermal packaging","light emitting diode","thermal design constraints","design decision making"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509387","abstract":"LED diode performance is a function of the device thermal conditions.

A photonic interconnection network can deliver higher bandwidth and lower latencies with significantly lower power dissipation. We explain why on-chip photonic communication has recently become a feasible opportunity and explore the challenges that need to be addressed to realize its implementation. We introduce a novel hybrid micro-architecture for NoCs combining a broadband photonic circuit-switched network with an electronic overlay packet-switched control network. We address the critical design issues including: topology, routing algorithms, deadlock avoidance, and path-setup/tear-down procedures. We present experimental results obtained with POINTS, an event-driven simulator specifically developed to analyze the proposed idea, as well as a comparative power analysis of a photonic versus an electronic NoC. Overall, these results confirm the unique benefits for future generations of CMPs that can be achieved by bringing optics into the chip in the form of photonic NoCs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4579700/04509424.pdf","startPage":"1246","endPage":"1260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic Networks-on-Chip for Future Generations of Chip Multiprocessors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Photonic Networks-on-Chip for Future Generations of Chip Multiprocessors","volume":"57","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509424/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177177","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509424/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic Networks-on-Chip for Future Generations of Chip Multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"ttc2008091246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086974S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4579700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"634","articleId":"4509424","onlineDate":"20 June 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4509435,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4804305/4509435/4509435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Chun Wang received the BS degree in electrical engineering from the National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1986, the MS degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1988, and the MSc and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 1995 and 1996, respectively.

However, wide-band spectrum sensing requires energy consumption processes. In this paper, we aim to relieve the burden of spectrum scanning in a CR system by means of location awareness. We investigate to what extent a CR system with location awareness capability can establish a scanning-free region where a peer-to-peer connection of the secondary CR users can coexist with an infrastructure-based connection of the primary user. We compute the concurrent transmission probability of a peer-to-peer connection and an infrastructure-based connection in a system based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) medium access control (MAC) protocol. It has been shown that the frequency band of the legacy system can be reused up to 45% by the overlaying cognitive ad hoc network if certain location techniques help CR users locate primary and other secondary users. In summary, a CR system equipped with location awareness techniques can dramatically reduce the need of spectrum sensing thanks to the capability of identifying the concurrent transmission region in a hybrid infrastructure-based and ad hoc overlaying systems. Hence, from another aspect, the issue of wide-band spectrum sensing in CR systems is resolved fundamentally.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.72","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4804305/04509435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.72","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"577","endPage":"589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Location Awareness on Concurrent Transmissions for Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks Overlaying Infrastructure-Based Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Location Awareness on Concurrent Transmissions for Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks Overlaying Infrastructure-Based Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509435/","volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4509435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10520182","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Location Awareness on Concurrent Transmissions for Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks Overlaying Infrastructure-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"ttm2009050577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139352S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4804305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4804305","articleId":"4509435","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509436,"authors":[{"name":"Michael G.

SANE uses background subtraction to find the segmentation of moving objects in videos. This provides object segmentation information for each video frame. The collection of frames and segmentations forms a training set that SANE uses to learn the image and shape properties of the observed motion boundaries. When presented with new static images, the trained model infers segmentations similar to the observed motion segmentations. SANE is a general method for learning environment-specific segmentation models. Because it can automatically generate training data from video, it can adapt to a new environment and new objects with relative ease, an advantage over untrained segmentation methods or those that require human-labeled training data. By using the local shape information in the training data, it outperforms a trained local boundary detector. Its performance is competitive with a trained top-down segmentation algorithm that uses global shape. The shape information it learns from one class of objects can assist the segmentation of other classes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4785439/04509436.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"676","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation According to Natural Examples: Learning Static Segmentation from Motion Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation According to Natural Examples: Learning Static Segmentation from Motion Segmentation","volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4509436/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10476222","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","pubMedId":"19229082","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation According to Natural Examples: Learning Static Segmentation from Motion Segmentation","sourcePdf":"ttp2009040661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064429S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4785439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4785439","articleId":"4509436","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509437,"authors":[{"name":"Man Lan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore","Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4785439/4509437/4509437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Man Lan received the BSc degrees in fine chemical (Major) and computer science (Minor) from the Dalian University of Technology, China, in 1996, the MSc degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2002, and the PhD degree in computer science from the National University of Singapore, in 2007.

Different terms (i.e. words, phrases, or any other indexing units used to identify the contents of a text) have different importance in a text. The term weighting methods assign appropriate weights to the terms to improve the performance of text categorization. In this study, we investigate several widely-used unsupervised (traditional) and supervised term weighting methods on benchmark data collections in combination with SVM and kNN algorithms. In consideration of the distribution of relevant documents in the collection, we propose a new simple supervised term weighting method, i.e. tf.rf, to improve the terms' discriminating power for text categorization task. From the controlled experimental results, these supervised term weighting methods have mixed performance. Specifically, our proposed supervised term weighting method, tf.rf, has a consistently better performance than other term weighting methods while other supervised term weighting methods based on information theory or statistical metric perform the worst in all experiments. On the other hand, the popularly used tf.idf method has not shown a uniformly good performance in terms of different data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10479156","pubMedId":"19229086","htmlLink":"/document/4509437/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Supervised and Traditional Term Weighting Methods for Automatic Text Categorization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised and Traditional Term Weighting Methods for Automatic Text Categorization","sourcePdf":"ttp2009040721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13474S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4785439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"312","xplore-issue":"4785439","articleId":"4509437","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4509438,"authors":[{"name":"Josef Sivic","affiliation":["WILLOW Project-Team, Laboratoire d'Informatique de I'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (CNRS/ENS/INRIA UMR 8548), INRIA, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4785439/4509438/4509438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Josef Sivic received a degree from the Czech Technical University, Prague, in 2002 and the PhD degree from the University of Oxford in 2006.

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject those that are unstable. Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google. We report results for object retrieval on the full length feature films 'Groundhog Day', 'Casablanca' and 'Run Lola Run', including searches from within the movie and specified by external images downloaded from the Internet. We investigate retrieval performance with respect to different quantizations of region descriptors and compare the performance of several ranking measures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","volume":"31","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10476223","pubMedId":"19229077","publicationDate":"April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509438/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Visual Search of Videos Cast as Text Retrieval","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Visual Search of Videos Cast as Text Retrieval","sourcePdf":"ttp2009040591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119046S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4785439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"302","xplore-issue":"4785439","articleId":"4509438","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":4509443,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

However, the water medium is inhomogeneous and the sound speed varies depending on several parameters, e.g., the temperature, pressure and salinity. As a result, sound waves do not necessarily travel in straight lines. Ignoring this stratification effect could lead to considerable bias in the range estimates. We propose a depth-based approach to compensate the stratification effect for improved underwater ranging. We assume that the sound velocity profile (SVP) is only vertically stratified, the position of the sender is known, and the receiver has a noisy depth estimate via a depth sensor. We find a numerically simple range estimator, based on reconstructing the slanted path using Fermat's Principle and calculus of variations. This estimator removes the bias and is asymptotically efficient. We compare our solution to the simplistic linear estimator that assumes straight-line propagation in a shallow-water example where the sound speed decreases monotonically with depth. We find that the bias of the linear estimator increases with range and is non-negligible when the ToA measurements have a small variance, while our solution is bias-free and meets the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509443/","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4509443/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115176","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Stratification Effect Compensation for Improved Underwater Acoustic Ranging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stratification Effect Compensation for Improved Underwater Acoustic Ranging","sourcePdf":"56tsp08-berger-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070048S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4567633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4567633","articleId":"4509443","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509448,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Further enhancement can be obtained by optimizing the power allocation of the users. The resulting constrained single-objective optimization problem is solved here by means of particle swarm optimization (PSO). It is shown that the maximum number of users for a CDMA system can be increased significantly if an optimized power profile is employed. Furthermore, an extensive study of PSO control parameter settings using three different neighborhood topologies is performed on the basis of the power allocation problem, and two constraint-handling techniques are evaluated. Results from the parameter study are compared with examinations from the literature.

Since the output power and the induced voltage both vary, full-scale back-to-back converters are employed to connect the WEC to the power grid in order to maintain a constant active power and terminal voltage at the system side. The controllers for the generator side converter and the grid side converter of the back-to-back converters are also developed.

Furthermore, the WEC can keep the output power at the power grid converter side constant and maintain the terminal voltage constant with the grid side converter controller. These are the desired features for the WEC to operate in parallel with the power grid. The effectiveness of the controller proposed is also validated under small disturbance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Energy conversion","Power grids","Power system dynamics","Power generation","Power system simulation","Mesh generation","Voltage","Permanent magnets","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear machines","permanent magnet generators","power convertors","wave power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave energy conversion system","power grid","Archimedes wave swing","linear permanent magnet generator","generator side converter","grid side converter","linear synchronous motors","full-scale back-to-back converters","isolated R-C load","power system stability","power system dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Archimedes wave swing","control systems","linear synchronous motors","modeling","permanent magnet generators","wave energy"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922530","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4578730/04509469.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Control of AWS-Based Wave Energy Conversion System Integrated Into Power Grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of AWS-Based Wave Energy Conversion System Integrated Into Power Grid","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10117943","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","volume":"23","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509469/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of AWS-Based Wave Energy Conversion System Integrated Into Power Grid","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-wu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063901S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4509469","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509471,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhang Yun was born in China in December of 1973.

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network. This system integration will improve forecasting accuracy and overcome the defects of the RBF network. As shown in this paper by the results of an example of factual forecasting, the model presented can work effectively. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922249","startPage":"853","endPage":"858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4578730","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4578730/04509471.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RBF Neural Network and ANFIS-Based Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach in Real-Time Price Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509471/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RBF Neural Network and ANFIS-Based Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach in Real-Time Price Environment","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4509471/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10117947","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBF Neural Network and ANFIS-Based Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach in Real-Time Price Environment","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs03-yun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086888S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4578730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"273","xplore-issue":"4578730","articleId":"4509471","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4509472,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Suk Oh","affiliation":["Rambus, Inc., Los Altos, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4674527/4509472/4509472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyung Suk (Dan) Oh (S'91\u2013M'95\u2013SM'06) received the B.S.

Traditional SPICE-based simulation techniques can precisely simulate various deterministic jitter sources, such as intersymbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk from passive channels. The inclusion of random jitter in SPICE simulations, however, results in long simulation time. Innovative simulation techniques based on a statistical simulation framework have been recently introduced to cosimulate deterministic and random jitter effects efficiently. This paper presents new improvements on this statistical simulation framework. In particular, we introduce an accurate jitter modeling technique which accounts for bounded jitter with arbitrary spectrum in addition to Gaussian jitter. We also present a rigorous approach to model duty cycle distortion (DCD). A number of I/O systems are considered as examples to validate the proposed modeling methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate System Voltage and Timing Margin Simulation in High-Speed I/O System Designs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2008.923388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4674527/04509472.pdf","startPage":"722","endPage":"730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2008.923388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Accurate System Voltage and Timing Margin Simulation in High-Speed I/O System Designs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4509472/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate System Voltage and Timing Margin Simulation in High-Speed I/O System Designs","sourcePdf":"tadvp-oh-923388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061872S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4674527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4674527","articleId":"4509472","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509489,"authors":[{"name":"Azadeh Davoodi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4526712/4509489/4509489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Azadeh Davoodi (S'02\u2013M'06) received the B.S. degree from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Maryland, College Park, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Typically ldquobinningrdquo is applied to those chips that are not meeting their performance requirement after fabrication. Using binning, such failing chips are sold at a loss (e.g., proportional to the degree that they are failing their performance requirement). This paper discusses a gate-sizing algorithm to minimize ldquoyield-lossrdquo associated with binning. We propose a binning yield-loss function as a suitable objective to be minimized. We show this objective is convex with respect to the size variables and consequently can be optimally and efficiently solved. These contributions are yet made without making any specific assumptions about the sources of variability or how they are modeled. We show computation of the binning yield-loss can be done via any desired statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) tool. The proposed technique is compared with a recently proposed sensitivity-based statistical sizer, a deterministic sizer with worst-case variability estimate, and a deterministic sizer with relaxed area constraint. We show consistent improvement compared to the sensitivity-based approach in quality of solution (final binning yield-loss value) as well as huge run-time gain. Moreover, we show that a deterministic sizer with a relaxed area constraint will also result in reasonably good binning yield-loss values for the extra area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509489/","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10173366","volume":"16","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Variability Driven Gate Sizing for Binning Yield Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variability Driven Gate Sizing for Binning Yield Optimization","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi06-davoodi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080149S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4526712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4526712","articleId":"4509489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4509507,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Matas","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4509507/4509507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Matas received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunications engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1988, 1996, and 2003, respectively.","From 1988 to 1990, he was an Engineer of a consumer electronics company.

The improvement of wind turbine performance under such conditions has become a problem of general concern. However, this performance usually relies on conventional linear controllers that operate at network faults far off the nominal point for which they were designed. As a consequence, wind turbines should operate with increasing converter currents, which may result in converter damage. This paper proposes a nonlinear controller for converter-based wind turbines that ensures that the currents are maintained within the design limits. The controller is based on feedback linearization theory and is applied to the system through a sliding mode approach. This controller is robust against system perturbations and uncertainties, and overcomes the usually complex implementation that is associated with feedback linearization controllers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04509507.pdf","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback Linearization Of Direct-Drive Synchronous Wind-Turbines Via a Sliding Mode Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind turbines","Sliding mode control","Power system stability","Wind energy","Linear feedback control systems","Control systems","Power generation","Circuit faults","Voltage fluctuations","Wind energy generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","linearisation techniques","nonlinear control systems","power convertors","power generation control","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback linearization controllers","direct-drive synchronous wind-turbines","sliding mode control","linear controllers","converter currents","nonlinear controller","converter-based wind turbines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback linearization","grid fault","ride-through control","sliding mode control","wind energy","wind power generation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Feedback Linearization Of Direct-Drive Synchronous Wind-Turbines Via a Sliding Mode Approach","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4509507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960786","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback Linearization Of Direct-Drive Synchronous Wind-Turbines Via a Sliding Mode Approach","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-matas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099706S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4509507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509521,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyu Song","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Center (CERC) and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4509511/4509521/4509521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tongyu Song (S'02) received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, in 2007.","Since September 2004, he was a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant with the Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin, where he was involved in the design of rail-to-rail amplifiers for VLSI cell library and wideband delta-sigma modulators. in the summer if 2006, he interned at Analog Devices, Wilmington, MA, where he was involved with high-performance radio-frequency digital-to-analog converters. from February 2007 to August 2007, he was with Alereon, Austin, TX, as an RF Intern, working on LOIQ clock generators and MAC phase-locked loop for ultra-wide band (UWB) tranceivers. in September 2007, he joined Qualcomm, San Diego, CA, as Mixed-Signal IC Design engineer.

The proposed circuit does not rely on the characteristics and particular operation (strong, moderate, and weak inversion) regions of the input transistors and is insensitive to mismatches between p- and n-channel devices. Only standard CMOS transistors are used in the circuit without any special devices, such as floating-gate or depletion-mode transistors. Very small variations (less than ) have been achieved without sacrificing the large-signal behavior. The proposed circuit is proven effective for both long-channel and deep sub-micron CMOS technologies and is suitable for VLSI cell libraries, audio/video, embedded mixed-signal system-on-chip (SoC), and other applications. A prototype amplifier with rail-to-rail input common-mode range has been designed and fabricated in a standard 0.35-m CMOS technology. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of proposed techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Voltage","Tail","Transconductance","Circuits","Switches","Rail to rail inputs","MOS devices","Mirrors","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","system-on-chip","transistor circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI cell libraries","input transistors","p-channel devices","n-channel devices","CMOS transistors","floating-gate transistors","depletion-mode transistors","mixed-signal system-on-chip","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS analog integrated circuits","constant-$g_m$","constant slew rate","operational amplifiers","rail-to-rail"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.916414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4509511/04509521.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.916414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust and Scalable Constant-- Rail-to-Rail CMOS Input Stage With Dynamic Feedback for VLSI Cell Libraries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509521","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Robust and Scalable Constant-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$g_m$</tex> </formula> Rail-to-Rail CMOS Input Stage With Dynamic Feedback for VLSI Cell Libraries","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509521/","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509521/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9944383","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust and Scalable Constant-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$g_m$</tex> </formula> Rail-to-Rail CMOS Input Stage With Dynamic Feedback for VLSI Cell Libraries","sourcePdf":"55tcsi03-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090011S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4509511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4509511","articleId":"4509521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509571,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Augusta","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Augusta","id":"38246755800"},{"name":"Zdenek Hurak","affiliation":["School of Electronics and ComputerScience, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Hurak","id":"37300382900"},{"name":"Eric Rogers","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Rogers","id":"37274939300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1111-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1112-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4509571","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"In this paper we develop new results on control design for spatially distributed linear systems using an n- D systems approach.

The intuitively designed ensemble methods, namely, majority voting (MV), rank voting, Boltzmann multiplication (BM), and Boltzmann addition, combine the policies derived from the value functions of the different RL algorithms, in contrast to previous work where ensemble methods have been used in RL for representing and learning a single value function. We show experiments on five maze problems of varying complexity; the first problem is simple, but the other four maze tasks are of a dynamic or partially observable nature. The results indicate that the BM and MV ensembles significantly outperform the single RL algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.920231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.920231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4567535/04509588.pdf","startPage":"930","endPage":"936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning","volume":"38","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509588/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10117708","pubMedId":"18632380","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509588/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb04-wiering.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07206S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4567535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4567535","articleId":"4509588","onlineDate":"02 May 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4509589,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4567535/4509589/4509589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhou received the B.Eng. degree (first-class honors) in electrical and electronic engineering in 2004 from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is a Lecturer with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore Polytechnic, Singapore.

Using the theoretical principles in this framework, three main contributions are presented. First, a novel family of kernel-based methods for multitemporal classification of remote sensing images is presented. The second contribution is the development of nonlinear kernel classifiers for the well-known difference and ratioing change detection methods by formulating them in an adequate high-dimensional feature space. Finally, the presented methodology allows the integration of contextual information and multisensor images with different levels of nonlinear sophistication. The binary support vector (SV) classifier and the one-class SV domain description classifier are evaluated by using both linear and nonlinear kernel functions. Good performance on synthetic and real multitemporal classification scenarios illustrates the generalization of the framework and the capabilities of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.916201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4524010/04509590.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.916201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4524010","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel-Based Framework for Multitemporal and Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification and Change Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-Based Framework for Multitemporal and Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification and Change Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10002951","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509590/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel-Based Framework for Multitemporal and Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification and Change Detection","sourcePdf":"46tgrs06-campsvalls.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108388S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4524010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"261","xplore-issue":"4524010","articleId":"4509590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509592,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Lemoine","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4527042/4509592/4509592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christophe Lemoine received the Dipl. d'Ing. degree from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace, Toulouse, France, in 2004.

The major difficulty is to select uncorrelated samples in order to make a statistical analysis of the data. Furthermore, the knowledge of the number of independent samples is of crucial importance to assess the measurement accuracy. To evaluate whether measured data are independent, the conventional method compares the autocorrelation function (ACF) with the critical value 0.37. However, this criterion is generally not appropriate because the ACF probability density function (pdf) depends strongly on the sample size. For a measurement series of length N, the effective sample size (ESS) is defined as the number N' < N of independent samples, which would provide the same information as the N-size sample. This paper aims to provide a new method based on autoregressive (AR) models and the central limit theorem (CLT) in the case of dependent data, for estimating the ESS. The proposed method is easy to implement since it requires only the knowledge of simple statistical parameters. Moreover, it provides useful guidelines to assess the maximum number of independent samples available with the mode stirrer. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical models, either for the electric field or the received power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Electromagnetic compatibility","Uncertainty","Probability density function","Size measurement","Time series analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","correlation methods","electromagnetic compatibility","estimation theory","probability","reverberation chambers","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverberation chamber","boundary condition","mode stirrer","statistical analysis","autocorrelation function","probability density function","effective sample size estimation","autoregressive model","central limit theorem","electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autocorrelation function (ACF)","autoregressive models","effective sample size","independent samples","reverberation chamber (RC)"]},{"kwd":["Autocorrelation function (ACF)","autoregressive models","effective sample size","independent samples","reverberation chamber (RC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.919037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4527042/04509592.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4527042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.919037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the Effective Sample Size to Select Independent Measurements in a Reverberation Chamber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the Effective Sample Size to Select Independent Measurements in a Reverberation Chamber","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509592/","volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509592/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10002933","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the Effective Sample Size to Select Independent Measurements in a Reverberation Chamber","sourcePdf":"50temc02-lemoine.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079485S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4527042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4527042","articleId":"4509592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509606,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

We obtain analytical upper and lower bounds on the critical density for phase transition in this model. We then examine dynamic models, where each link is active or inactive according to a Markov on- off process. We show that a phase transition also exists in such dynamic networks, and the critical density for this model is the same as the one for static networks under some mild conditions. Furthermore, due to the dynamic behavior of links, a delay is incurred for any transmission even when propagation delay is ignored. We study the behavior of this transmission delay and show that the delay scales linearly with the Euclidean distance between the sender and the receiver when the network is in the subcritical phase, and the delay scales sub-linearly with the distance if the network is in the supercritical phase.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509606.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity and Latency in Large-Scale Wireless Networks with Unreliable Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509606/","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity and Latency in Large-Scale Wireless Networks with Unreliable Links","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945322","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity and Latency in Large-Scale Wireless Networks with Unreliable Links","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T3-1-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094014S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4509609,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, most of the existing sampling methods suffer from large estimation errors in analyzing small-size flows. To address the problem, we propose a novel adaptive non-linear sampling (ANLS) method for passive measurement. Instead of statically configuring the sampling rate, ANLS dynamically adjusts the sampling rate for a flow depending on the number of packets having been counted. We provide the generic principles guiding the selection of sampling function for sampling rate adjustment. Moreover, we derive the unbiased flow size estimation, the bound of the relative error, and the bound of required counter size for ANLS. The performance of ANLS is thoroughly studied through theoretic analysis and experiments under synthetic/real network data traces, with comparison to several related sampling methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed ANLS can significantly improve the estimation accuracy, particularly for small-size flows, while maintain a memory and processing overhead comparable to existing methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Telecommunication traffic","Estimation error","Engineering management","USA Councils","Counting circuits","Random access memory","Remote monitoring","Communications Society","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","measurement systems","sampling methods","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic monitoring","adaptive nonlinear sampling method","measurement systems","memory consumption","processing overhead","Internet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.14","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509609.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate and Efficient Traffic Monitoring Using Adaptive Non-Linear Sampling Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate and Efficient Traffic Monitoring Using Adaptive Non-Linear Sampling Method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509609/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509609/","accessionNumber":"9962228","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate and Efficient Traffic Monitoring Using Adaptive Non-Linear Sampling Method","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T3-2-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064024S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4509614,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This is not only because adversaries may attack against sensor source privacy through traffic analysis, but also because sensor networks are very limited in resources. As such, a practical tradeoff between security and performance is desirable. In this paper, for the first time we propose the notion of statistically strong source anonymity, under a challenging attack model where a global attacker is able to monitor the traffic in the entire network. We propose a scheme called FitProbRate, which realizes statistically strong source anonymity for sensor networks. We also demonstrate the robustness of our scheme under various statistical tests that might be employed by the attacker to detect real events. Our analysis and simulation results show that our scheme, besides providing source anonymity, can significantly reduce real event reporting latency compared to two baseline schemes.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.19","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509614.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Statistically Strong Source Anonymity for Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509614/","displayDocTitle":"Towards Statistically Strong Source Anonymity for Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962231","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509614/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Statistically Strong Source Anonymity for Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T3-3-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05379S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509619,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Such dense mesh deployments have high levels of interaction across heterogeneous wireless links. We find that this heterogeneous backhaul consisting of data-carrying (forwarding) links \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">and</i>\n non- data-carrying (non-forwarding) links creates two key effects on performance. First, we show that low-rate management and control packets can produce a disproportionally large degradation in data throughput. We define a metric for this effect called Wireless Overhead Multiplier and use it to quantify the impact of MAC and PHY mechanisms on the the throughput degradation. Surprisingly, we show that these multiplicative effects are primarily driven by the non-forwarding links where, in the worst case, data packets lose physical layer capture to the overhead, yielding disproportionate throughput degradation. Finally, we show that when data flows contend in this worst-case scenario, the loss-based autorate policy is unnecessarily triggered, causing throughput imbalance and poor network utilization.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.24","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509619.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Measurement Study of Multiplicative Overhead Effects in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509619/","displayDocTitle":"A Measurement Study of Multiplicative Overhead Effects in Wireless Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945330","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509619/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Measurement Study of Multiplicative Overhead Effects in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T3-4-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108042S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509642,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, in multipath provisioning, differential delay is an important constraint which should not be ignored. We investigate survivability of service paths based on differential-delay constraint (DDC) and multipath provisioning together in a telecom backbone mesh network. We present a DDC-based K link-disjoint paths algorithm (DDCKDP) for multipath provisioning subject to DDC. We also compare it with the minimum-cost-flow (MCF) and K shortest link-disjoint paths (KDP) algorithm, using Shared Protection of the Largest Individual Traversed link (SPLIT), under dynamic service request with several different DDCs. We find that (1) exploiting link-disjoint paths is very efficient for survivable multipath provisioning; and (2) SPLIT-DDCKDP is resource efficient, has low signaling overhead, and has fast fault-recovery for survivable multipath provisioning with DDC. For a 5 ms DDC, DDCKDP can decrease the Bandwidth Blocking Ratio (BBR) by more than 100% compared with KDP in a typical US backbone network.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.47","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survivable Multipath Provisioning with Differential Delay Constraint in Telecom Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Survivable Multipath Provisioning with Differential Delay Constraint in Telecom Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509642/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945344","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survivable Multipath Provisioning with Differential Delay Constraint in Telecom Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T4-4-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071499S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509648,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A key result of this paper is that contrary to the conventional wireless networks, in wireless sensor networks, longer packets reduce the collision probability. Consequently, an optimization solution is formalized by using three different objective functions, i.e., packet throughput, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Furthermore, the effects of end-to-end latency and reliability constraints are investigated that may be required by a particular application. As a result, a generic, cross-layer optimization framework is developed to determine the optimal packet size in WSN. This framework is further extended to determine the optimal packet size in underwater and underground sensor networks. From this framework, the optimal packet sizes under various network parameters are determined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509649/","accessionNumber":"9945348","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Packet Size Optimization for Wireless Terrestrial, Underwater, and Underground Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Packet Size Optimization for Wireless Terrestrial, Underwater, and Underground Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T4-6-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053014S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509650,"authors":[{"name":"A.

MAC design for UWSN faces significant challenges. For example, acoustic communication suffers from latencies five orders-of-magnitude larger than radio communication, so a naive CSMA MAC would require very long listen time resulting in low throughput and poor energy efficiency. In this paper, we first identify unique characteristics in underwater networking that may affect all MACs, such as space-time uncertainty and deafness conditions. We then develop T-Lohi employing a novel tone-based contention resolution mechanism that exploits space-time uncertainty and high latency to detect collisions and count contenders, achieving good throughput across all offered loads. Lohi uses our low-power wake-up receiver to significantly reduce energy consumption. Finally, we evaluate design choices and protocol performance through extensive simulation. The results show that the energy cost of packet transmission is within 3-9 % of optimal, and that Lohi achieves good channel utilization, within 30% utilization of the theoretical maximum. We also show that Lohi is stable and fair under both low and very high offered loads.","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509650.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"235","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"T-Lohi: A New Class of MAC Protocols for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"T-Lohi: A New Class of MAC Protocols for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/4509650/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9962245","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"T-Lohi: A New Class of MAC Protocols for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"T4-6-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053703S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4509651,"authors":[{"name":"W.

To avoid any possible malicious attack and resource abuse, employing a digital signature scheme is widely recognized as the most effective approach for VSNs to achieve authentication, integrity, and validity. However, when the number of signatures received by a Roadside Unit (RSU) becomes large, a scalability problem emerges immediately, where the RSU could be difficult to sequentially verify each received signature within 300 ms interval according to the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) broadcast protocol. In this paper, we introduce an efficient batch signature verification scheme for communications between vehicles and RSUs (or termed vehicle- to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications), in which an RSU can verify multiple received signatures at the same time such that the total verification time can be dramatically reduced. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve conditional privacy preservation that is essential in VSNs, where each message launched by a vehicle is mapped to a distinct pseudo identity, while a trust authority can always retrieve the real identity of a vehicle from any pseudo identity. With the proposed scheme, since identity-based cryptography is employed in generating private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not needed and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509653/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9962248","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509653/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Identity-Based Batch Verification Scheme for Vehicular Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Identity-Based Batch Verification Scheme for Vehicular Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W1-1-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089592S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4509663,"authors":[{"name":"X.

In this paper, we provide a formal analysis on the performance of the practical coding scheme under such realistic settings. The key performance measure is the encoding number, i.e., the number of packets that can be encoded by a coding node in each transmission. We provide an upper bound on the encoding number for the general coding topology, and derive the average encoding number and system throughput for a general class of random access mechanisms. Based on the practical coding scheme, we also derive a tighter upper bound on the throughput gain for a general wireless network.

However, fairness, a very important performance measure of multi-user communications systems and networks, has not been addressed for MIMO-BC in the literature. In this paper, we study how to determine the weighted proportional fairness (WPF) capacity of MIMO-BC. The difficulty of finding the WPF capacity of MIMO-BC lies in that it contains two difficult subproblems: 1) a complex combinatorial optimization problem to determine the optimal decoding order in the dual MIMO multiple access channel (MEMO-MAC) and 2) a nonconvex optimization problem in computing the optimal input covariance matrices to achieve WPF capacity. To circumvent the difficulty in the first subproblem, we derive a set of optimality conditions that the optimal decoding order must satisfy. Based on these optimality conditions, we design an efficient algorithm called iterative gradient sorting (IGS) to determine the optimal decoding order by iteratively sorting the gradient entries and moving across corner points. We also show that this method can be geometrically interpreted as sequential gradient projections. For the second subproblem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on conjugate gradient projection (CGP) technique, which employs the concept of Hessian conjugate. We also develop a polynomial time algorithm to solve the projection subproblem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Proportional Fairness Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.85","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509680.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Proportional Fairness Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509680/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945354","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Proportional Fairness Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W2-3-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075047S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4509688,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We advocate a broad approach to addressing this problem that includes making power-awareness a primary objective in the design and configuration of networks, and in the design and implementation of network protocols. We support our arguments by providing a case study of power demands of two standard router platforms that enables us to create a generic model for router power consumption. We apply this model in a set of target network configurations and use mixed integer optimization techniques to investigate power consumption, performance and robustness in static network design and in dynamic routing.

The back-pressure algorithm introduced in [21] is a well-known distributed and adaptive routing/scheduling algorithm where nodes only need the queue length information of neighboring nodes to make routing decisions, and packets are adaptively routed in the network according to congestion information, which makes the algorithm resilient to traffic and topology changes. However, the back-pressure algorithm requires routers to maintain a separate queue for each destination, which prevents its implementation in large-scale networks like the Internet. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based back-pressure routing algorithm, which retains the distributability and adaptability of back-pressure routing, while significantly reducing the number of queues that have to be maintained at each node. Since the cluster-based algorithm performs adaptive load-balancing in the network, it has the potential to eliminate the need for off-line traffic engineering in the Internet.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.96","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509691.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"492","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Back-Pressure Routing Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Back-Pressure Routing Algorithm","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962279","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster-Based Back-Pressure Routing Algorithm","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W2-5-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.238536S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4509693,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper presents a system-level approach to interference management, that has reasonable backhaul communication and computation requirements. The basis for the approach is clustering and aggregation of measurements of the spatial diversity in sensitivity to interference associated with average user populations. This enables the system to exchange information and optimize coordinated transmission schedules using only coarse grained data. The paper explores various ways of optimizing such schedules: from a static, decoupled version to a dynamic version capturing user-level scheduling, fluctuating loads and inter-cell interference that couples base stations' performance. Based on extensive system-level simulations, we demonstrate reductions in file transfer delay ranging from 20-80%, from light to heavy loads, as compared to a simple baseline not unlike those in the field today. This improvement is achieved while providing more uniform coverage, and reducing base station power consumption by up to 45%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and Abstractions for Environment and Traffic Aware System-Level Coordination of Wireless Networks: The Downlink Case","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.98","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509693.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and Abstractions for Environment and Traffic Aware System-Level Coordination of Wireless Networks: The Downlink Case","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509693/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and Abstractions for Environment and Traffic Aware System-Level Coordination of Wireless Networks: The Downlink Case","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W2-6-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058281S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509694,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Before transmitting a frame on the downlink, an OFDMA base station has to invoke an algorithm that determines which of the pending packets will be transmitted, what modulation should be used for each of them, and how to construct the complex OFDMA frame matrix as a collection of rectangles that fit into a single matrix with fixed dimensions. We propose efficient, and theoretically best possible, algorithms that solves this intricate OFDMA scheduling problem by breaking it down into two sub-problems, referred to as macro and micro scheduling.

We pose the problem as a multicast throughput optimization problem. As a solution we present how one can jointly utilize fixed-rate and rateless erasure coding along with simple rate adaptation techniques in order to achieve the optimal multicast throughput per user. We first investigate the performance of the proposed system under i.i.d. channel conditions. Our analysis shows a linear gain for the multicast capacity over i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels with respect to the number of users. Since the established results require coding over large number of blocks and hence induce large decoding delays, we extend our analysis to the cases where we code over shorter block lengths and thus quantify the delay-capacity tradeoffs under a simple setting. We further look into non-i.i.d. channel conditions and show achievable gains by modifying a scheduling heuristic whose fairness is well- established for opportunistic scheduling of unicast flows. Our overall evaluations demonstrate that under both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. channel conditions, opportunistic multicasting with erasure coding can significantly improve the performance over the traditional techniques used in today's communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509695.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.100","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"520","endPage":"528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Throughput Capacity of Opportunistic Multicasting with Erasure Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Throughput Capacity of Opportunistic Multicasting with Erasure Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509695/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509695/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962283","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Throughput Capacity of Opportunistic Multicasting with Erasure Codes","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W2-6-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136372S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4509706,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In recent years a number of papers have presented theoretical solutions to this problem that are based on combining differential-backlog scheduling algorithms with utility-based congestion control. However, this work typically does not address a number of issues such as how signaling should be performed and how the new algorithms interact with other wireless protocols. In this paper we address such issues. In particular: ldr We define a specific network utility maximization problem that we believe is appropriate for mobile adhoc networks. ldr We describe a wireless greedy primal dual (wGPD) algorithm for combined congestion control and scheduling that aims to solve this problem. ldr We show how the wGPD algorithm and its associated signaling can be implemented in practice with minimal disruption to existing wireless protocols. ldr We show via OPNET simulation that wGPD significantly outperforms standard protocols such as 802.11 operating in conjunction with TCP.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal spot pricing of spectrum by a provider in the presence of both non-elastic primary users, with long-term commitments, and opportunistic, elastic secondary users. We first show that optimal pricing can be formulated as an infinite horizon average reward problem and solved using stochastic dynamic programming. Next, we investigate the design of efficient single pricing policies. We provide numerical and analytical evidences that static pricing policies do not perform well in such settings (in sharp contrast to settings where all the users are elastic). On the other hand, we prove that deterministic threshold pricing achieves optimal profit amongst all single-price policies and performs close to global optimal pricing. We characterize the profit regions of static and threshold pricing, as a function of the arrival rate of primary users. Under certain reasonable assumptions on the demand function, we show that the profit region of threshold pricing can be far larger than that of static pricing. Moreover, we also show that these profit regions critically depend on the support of the demand function rather than specific form of it. We prove that the profit function of threshold pricing is unimodal in price and determine a restricted interval in which the optimal threshold lies. These two properties enable very efficient computation of the optimal threshold policy that is far faster than that of the global optimal policy.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.118","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"682","endPage":"690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spot Pricing of Secondary Spectrum Usage in Wireless Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spot Pricing of Secondary Spectrum Usage in Wireless Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509713/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962301","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509713/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spot Pricing of Secondary Spectrum Usage in Wireless Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W3-5-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090544S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509714,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Optimizing these processes is an important step towards maximizing the utilization of current and future cellular networks. In this paper we study the potential benefit of global cell selection versus the current local mobile SNR-based decision protocol. In particular, we study the new possibility that is feasible in OFDMA-based systems, of satisfying the minimal demand of a mobile station simultaneously by more than one base station. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem, called the all-or-nothing demand maximization problem, and show that when the demand of a single mobile station can exceed the capacity of a base station, this problem is not only NP-hard but also cannot be approximated within any reasonable factor. In contrast, under the very practical assumption that the maximum required bandwidth of a single mobile station is at most an r-fraction of the capacity of a base station, we present two different algorithms for cell selection. The first algorithm guarantees a satisfaction of at least a 1- r r fraction of an optimal assignment, where a mobile station can be covered simultaneously by more than one base station. The second algorithm guarantees a satisfaction of at least a 1-r/1-r fraction of an optimal assignment, while every mobile station is covered by at most one base station. Using an extensive simulation study we show that the cell selections determined by our algorithms achieve a better utilization of high-loaded capacity-constrained future 4G networks than the current SNR- based scheme. Specifically, our algorithms are shown to obtain up to 20% better usage of the network's capacity, in comparison with the current cell selection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.120","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"700","endPage":"708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell Selection in 4G Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cell Selection in 4G Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509715/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509715/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945356","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Selection in 4G Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W3-5-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071955S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509719,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, discerning the exact cause of a packet loss, once it occurs, is known to be quite difficult. In this paper we take a fresh look at this problem of wireless packet loss diagnosis for 802.11-based communication and propose a promising technique called COLLIE. COLLIE performs loss diagnosis by using newly designed metrics that examine error patterns within a physical-layer \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">symbol</i>\n in order to expose statistical differences between collision and weak signal based losses. We implement COLLIE through custom driver-level modifications in Linux and evaluate its performance experimentally. Our results demonstrate that it has an accuracy ranging between 60-95% while allowing a false positive rate of up to 2%. We also demonstrate the use of COLLIE in subsequent link adaptations in both static and mobile wireless usage scenarios through measurements on regular laptops and the Netgear SPH101 Voice-over-WiFi phone. In these experiments, COLLIE led to throughput improvements of 20- 60% and reduced retransmission related costs by 40% depending upon the channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509719.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.124","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"735","endPage":"743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosing Wireless Packet Losses in 802.11: Separating Collision from Weak Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosing Wireless Packet Losses in 802.11: Separating Collision from Weak Signal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509719/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509719/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962306","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosing Wireless Packet Losses in 802.11: Separating Collision from Weak Signal","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W3-6-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04769S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4509727,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, it incurs an additional delay for packet delivery when each node needs to wait for its next-hop relay node to wake up, which could be unacceptable for delay-sensitive applications. Prior work in the literature has proposed to reduce this delay using anycast, where each node opportunistically selects the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes. In this paper, we study the joint control problem of how to optimally control the sleep-wake schedule, the anycast candidate set of next-hop neighbors, and anycast priorities, to maximize the network lifetime subject to a constraint on the expected end-to-end delay. We provide an efficient solution to this joint control problem. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can substantially outperform prior heuristic solutions in the literature, especially under the practical scenarios where there are obstructions in the coverage area of the wireless sensor network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Maximizing the Lifetime of Delay-Sensitive Wireless Sensor Networks with Anycast","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.132","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509727.pdf","startPage":"807","endPage":"815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"On Maximizing the Lifetime of Delay-Sensitive Wireless Sensor Networks with Anycast","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509727/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962313","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Maximizing the Lifetime of Delay-Sensitive Wireless Sensor Networks with Anycast","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W4-2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086207S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4509734,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We propose to address this challenge by integrating interference-aware statistical admission control with stability- driven spectrum allocation. Specifically, we propose to proactively regulate nodes' spectrum demand to allow efficient statistical multiplexing while minimizing outages. Admitted nodes coordinate to adapt instantaneous spectrum allocation to match time- varying demand. While the optimization problem is NP-hard, we develop computational-efficient algorithms with strong analytical guarantees.

The problem is to maximize the end-to-end average transmission rate under a long-term total power constraint by adapting the transmission power on each subcarrier over each hop and the transmission time used by each hop in every time frame. The solution to the problem is derived by decomposing it into two subproblems: short-term time and power allocation given an arbitrary total power constraint for each channel realization, and total power distribution over all channel realizations. We show that the optimal solution has the following features: the power allocation on subcarriers over each hop has the water-filling structure and a higher water level is given to the hop with relatively poor channel condition; meanwhile, the fraction of transmission time allocated to each hop is adjusted to keep the instantaneous rates over all hops equal. To tradeoff between performance, computational complexity and signalling overhead, three suboptimal resource allocation algorithms are also proposed. Numerical results are illustrated under different network settings and channel environments.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.140","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509735.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Resource Allocation in OFDM Based Linear Multi-Hop Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509735/","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Resource Allocation in OFDM Based Linear Multi-Hop Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962320","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509735/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End-to-End Resource Allocation in OFDM Based Linear Multi-Hop Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W4-4-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085355S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509736,"authors":[{"name":"P.

On the other hand, another important factor has to be brought in: there is a rise of competition between service providers in telecommunication networks such as for instance the Internet, and the impact of this competition has to be carefully analyzed. The present paper pertains to this recent stream of works. We consider a slotted resource allocation game with several providers, each of them having a fixed capacity during each time slot, and a fixed access price. Each provider serves its demand up to its capacity, demand in excess being dropped. Total user demand is therefore split among providers according to Wardrop's principle, depending on price and loss probability. Using the characterization of the resulting equilibrium, we prove, under mild conditions, the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium in the pricing game between providers. We also show that, remarkably, this equilibrium actually corresponds to the socially optimal situation obtained when both users and providers cooperate to maximize the sum of all utilities, this even if providers have the opportunity to artificially reduce their capacity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"888","endPage":"896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Price Competition in a Slotted Resource Allocation Game","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509736/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Price Competition in a Slotted Resource Allocation Game","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962321","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Price Competition in a Slotted Resource Allocation Game","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"W4-5-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075254S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509744,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The same preprocessing also facilitates route computation between any pair of nodes where the the route lies within any user supplied range of values.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.149","startPage":"960","endPage":"967","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509744.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iso-Contour Queries and Gradient Descent with Guaranteed Delivery in Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iso-Contour Queries and Gradient Descent with Guaranteed Delivery in Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509744/","accessionNumber":"9962329","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509744/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iso-Contour Queries and Gradient Descent with Guaranteed Delivery in Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y1-1-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074705S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509749,"authors":[{"name":"L.

To balance aggregate throughput while serving users in a fair manner, proportional fair or time-based fair scheduling has been proposed to apply at each access point (AP). However, since a realistic deployment of wireless LANs can consist of a network of APs, this paper considers proportional fairness in this much wider setting. Our technique is to intelligently associate users with APs to achieve optimal proportional fairness in a network of APs. We propose two approximation algorithms for periodical offline optimization. Our algorithms are the first approximation algorithms in the literature with a tight worst-case guarantee for the NP-hard problem. Our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms can obtain an aggregate throughput which can be as much as 2.3 times more than that of the max-min fair allocation in 802.11b. While maintaining aggregate throughput, our approximation algorithms outperform the default user-AP association method in the 802.11b standard significantly in terms of fairness.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.154","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509749.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate Wireless LANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate Wireless LANs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509749/","publicationDate":"April 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9962334","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509749/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate Wireless LANs","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y1-2-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040165S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"123","articleId":"4509749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4509760,"authors":[{"name":"C.

While a lower bound on the throughput performance of GMS is relatively well-known in the simple node-exclusive interference model, it has not been thoroughly explored in the more general K-hop interference model. Moreover, empirical observations suggest that the known bounds are quite loose, and that the performance of GMS is often close to optimal. In this paper, we provide a number of new analytic results characterizing the performance limits of GMS. We first provide an equivalent characterization of the efficiency ratio of GMS through a topological property called the local-pooling factor of the network graph. We then develop an iterative procedure to estimate the local-pooling factor under a large class of network topologies and interference models. We use these results to study the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS on two classes of network topologies. First, we show how these results can be applied to tree networks to prove that GMS achieves the full capacity region in tree networks under the K-hop interference model. Second, we show that the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS in geometric network graphs is between 1/6 and 1/3.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509760.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Capacity Region of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling Algorithm in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509760/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Capacity Region of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling Algorithm in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962345","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Capacity Region of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling Algorithm in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y1-5-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096262S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4509766,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper represents the first step towards building a framework for designing distributed robust optimization algorithms. We first discuss several models for describing parameter uncertainty sets that can lead to decomposable problem structures. These models include general polyhedron, D-norm, and ellipsoid. We then apply these models to solve robust power control in wireless networks and robust rate control in wireline networks. In both applications, we propose distributed algorithms that converge to the optimal robust solution. Various tradeoffs among performance, robustness, and distributiveness are illustrated both analytically and through simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509766.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1165","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Robust Optimization for Communication Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Communication networks","Robust control","Buildings","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Uncertain systems","Ellipsoids","Power control","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radio networks","set theory","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed robust optimization","communication networks","parameter uncertainty sets","general polyhedron","D-norm","ellipsoid","robust power control","wireless networks","robust rate control","wireline networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Robust Optimization for Communication Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962351","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Robust Optimization for Communication Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y1-6-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075943S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509770,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We first investigate multi-channel realities in WSNs through intensive empirical experiments with Micaz motes. Our study shows that current multi-channel protocols are not suitable for WSNs, because of the small number of available channels and unavoidable time errors found in real networks. With these observations, we propose a novel tree-based multichannel scheme for data collection applications, which allocates channels to disjoint trees and exploits parallel transmissions among trees. In order to minimize interference within trees, we define a new channel assignment problem which is proven NP- complete. Then we propose a greedy channel allocation algorithm which outperforms other schemes in dense networks with a small number of channels.We implement our protocol, called TMCP, in a real testbed. Through both simulation and real experiments, we show that TMCP can significantly improve network throughput and reduce packet losses. More importantly, evaluation results show that TMCP better accommodates multi-channel realities found in WSNs than other multi-channel protocols.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Interference","Throughput","Media Access Protocol","Computer science","Testing","Telecommunication network reliability","Frequency synchronization","Communications Society","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel allocation","greedy algorithms","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-channel communications","wireless sensor networks","tree-based multichannel scheme","data collection applications","parallel transmissions","channel assignment","greedy channel allocation algorithm","TMCP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.175","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509770.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic and Efficient Multi-Channel Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Realistic and Efficient Multi-Channel Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509770/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509770/","accessionNumber":"9962355","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic and Efficient Multi-Channel Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y2-1-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070582S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509774,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In these systems, setting the data trust level equal to the trust level of the data- providing entity would ignore system salient features, rendering applications ineffective and systems inflexible. This would be even more so if their operation is ephemeral, i.e., characterized by short-lived associations in volatile environments. In this paper, we address this challenge by extending the traditional notion of trust to data-centric trust: trustworthiness attributed to node-reported data per se. We propose a framework for data-centric trust establishment: First, trust in each individual piece of data is computed; then multiple, related but possibly contradictory, data are combined; finally, their validity is inferred by a decision component based on one of several evidence evaluation techniques. We consider and evaluate an instantiation of our framework in vehicular networks as a case study. Our simulation results show that our scheme is highly resilient to attackers and converges stably to the correct decision.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Data-Centric Trust Establishment in Ephemeral Ad Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509775.pdf","startPage":"1238","endPage":"1246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"On Data-Centric Trust Establishment in Ephemeral Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509775/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962360","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Data-Centric Trust Establishment in Ephemeral Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y2-2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082011S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4509778,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We study two channel-oblivious jammers: a periodic jammer that jams deterministically at a specified rate, and a memoryless jammer whose signals arrive according to a Poisson process. We also develop new models for channel-aware jamming, including a reactive jammer that only jams non-colliding transmissions and an omniscient jammer that optimally adjusts its strategy according to current states of the participating nodes. Our study comprises of a theoretical analysis of the saturation throughput of 802.11 under jamming, an extensive simulation study, and a testbed to conduct real world experimentation of jamming IEEE 802.11 using GNU Radio and USRP platform. In our theoretical analysis, we use a discrete-time Markov chain analysis to derive formulae for the saturation throughput of IEEE 802.11 under memoryless, reactive and omniscient jamming. One of our key results is a characterization of optimal omniscient jamming that establishes a lower bound on the saturation throughput of 802.11 under arbitrary jammer attacks. We validate the theoretical analysis by means of Qualnet simulations. Finally, we measure the real-world performance of periodic and memoryless jammers using our GNU radio jammer prototype.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509778.pdf","endPage":"1273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11 under Jamming","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.183","startPage":"1265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11 under Jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509778/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","accessionNumber":"9962363","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509778/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.11 under Jamming","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y2-3-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078226S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4509780,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we address this important issue in WSNs by adopting mobility and space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique to optimize system performance. Specifically, a mobile data collector, for convenience, called SenCar in this paper, is deployed in a WSN. It works like a mobile base station and polls each sensor while traversing its transmission range. Each sensor directly sends data to the SenCar without any relay so that the lifetime of sensors can be prolonged. We also consider applying SDMA technique to data gathering by equipping the SenCar with two antennas. With SDMA, two distinct compatible sensors may successfully make concurrent data uploading to the SenCar. Intuitively, if the SenCar can always simultaneously communicate with two compatible sensors, data uploading time can be cut into half in the ideal case. We focus on the problem of minimizing the total time of a data gathering tour which consists of two parts: data uploading time and moving time. To better enjoy the benefit of SDMA, the SenCar may have to visit some specific locations where more sensors are compatible, which may adversely prolong the moving path. Hence, an optimum solution should be a tradeoff between the shortest moving path and full utilization of SDMA. We refer to this optimization problem as mobile data gathering problem with SDMA, or MDG-SDMA for short. We formalize the MDG-SDMA problem into an integer program (IP) and then propose three heuristic algorithms that provide practically good solutions to the problem. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can greatly reduce the total data gathering time compared to the non-SDMA algorithm with only minimum overhead.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.185","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509780.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Data Gathering with Space-Division Multiple Access in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509780/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Data Gathering with Space-Division Multiple Access in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962365","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509780/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Data Gathering with Space-Division Multiple Access in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y2-4-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075228S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4509781,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper investigates how to design distributed algorithm for a future multi-hop CR network, with the objective of maximizing data rates for a set of user communication sessions. We study this problem via a cross-layer optimization approach, with joint consideration of power control, scheduling, and routing. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a distributed optimization algorithm that iteratively increases data rates for user communication sessions. During each iteration, there are two separate processes, a Conservative Iterative Process (CIP) and an Aggressive Iterative Process (AIP). For both CIP and AIP, we describe our design of routing, minimalist scheduling, and power control/scheduling modules. To evaluate the performance of the distributed optimization algorithm, we compare it to an upper bound of the objective function, since the exact optimal solution to the objective function cannot be obtained via its mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation. Since the achievable performance via our distributed algorithm is close to the upper bound and the optimal solution (unknown) lies between the upper bound and the feasible solution obtained by our distributed algorithm, we conclude that the results obtained by our distributed algorithm are very close to the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509781.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.186","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509781/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962366","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y2-4-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093781S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509782,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where secondary users can opportunistically access unused spectrum vacated by idle primaries. We introduce two metrics to protect primary performance, namely collision probability and overlapping time. We present three spectrum access schemes using different sensing, back-off, and transmission mechanisms. We show that they achieve indistinguishable secondary performance under given primary constraints. We provide closed form analysis on secondary user performance, present a tight capacity upper bound, and reveal the impact of various design options, such as sensing, packet length distribution, back-off time, packet overhead, and grouping.

One of the important capabilities of such technologies is the ability to capture a few packets simultaneously. This capability has the potential to improve the performance of the MAC layer. However, we show that in networks with spatially distributed nodes, reusing backoff mechanisms originally designed for narrow-band systems (e.g. CSMA/CA) is inefficient. It is well known that when networks with spatially distributed nodes operate with such MAC protocols, the channel may be captured by nodes that are near the destination, leading to unfairness. We show that when the physical layer enables multipacket reception, the negative implications of reusing the legacy protocols include not only such unfairness but also a significant throughput reduction. We present alternative backoff mechanisms and evaluate their performance via Markovian analysis and simulation. We show that our alternative backoff mechanisms can improve both overall throughput and fairness.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.202","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509797.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC for Networks with Multipacket Reception Capability and Spatially Distributed Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509797/","displayDocTitle":"MAC for Networks with Multipacket Reception Capability and Spatially Distributed Nodes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509797/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC for Networks with Multipacket Reception Capability and Spatially Distributed Nodes","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-2-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081006S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":4509808,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Applications for this work include joint probing and transmission for a secondary user in a cognitive radio network. Limited by resources, e.g., energy and time, the transmitter must decide on a subset of a potentially very large number of channels to probe and can only use for transmission those that have been found to be available. In contrast to previous works, we do not assume the user has a priori knowledge regarding the statistics of channel states. The main goal of this work is to design strategies that decide, based only on knowledge of the channel bandwidths/data rates, which channels to probe. We derive optimal strategies that maximize the total expected bandwidth/data rate in the worst-case, via a performance measure in the form of a competitive regret (ratio) between the average performance of a strategy and a genie (or omniscient observer). We examine the performance of these optimal strategies under a wide range of system parameters and practical channel models via numerical studies.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.213","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509808.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.213","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive Analysis of Opportunistic Spectrum Access Strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Competitive Analysis of Opportunistic Spectrum Access Strategies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509808/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509808/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962392","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive Analysis of Opportunistic Spectrum Access Strategies","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-5-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059568S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509809,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, we study FDMA channel assignment in a non-cooperative wireless network, where devices are selfish. Existing work on this problem has considered Nash equilibrium (NE), which is not a very strong solution concept and may not guarantee a good system-wide performance. In contrast, in this work we introduce a payment formula to ensure the existence of a strongly dominant strategy equilibrium (SDSE), a much stronger solution concept. We show that, when the system converges to a SDSE, it also achieves global optimality in terms of effective system-wide throughput. Furthermore, we extend our work to the case in which some radios have limited tunability. We show that, in this case, it is generally impossible to have a similar SDSE solution; but, with additional assumptions on the numbers of radios and the types of channels, etc., we can again achieve a SDSE solution that guarantees globally optimal effective system throughput in the entire system. Besides this extension, we also consider another extension of our strategic game, which is a repeated game that provides fairness. Finally, we evaluate our design in experiments. Our evaluations verify that the system does converge to the globally optimal channel assignment with our designed payment formula, and that the effective system- wide throughput is significantly higher than that of anarchy and Nash equilibrium (NE).","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509809.pdf","startPage":"1543","endPage":"1551","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.214","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Throughput","Frequency division multiaccess","Nash equilibrium","Time division multiple access","Radio transceivers","Degradation","Communications Society","Computer science","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","game theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["globally optimal channel assignment","noncooperative wireless networks","FDMA channel assignment","Nash Equilibrium","strongly dominant strategy equilibrium","strategic game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509809/","displayDocTitle":"Globally Optimal Channel Assignment for Non-Cooperative Wireless Networks","accessionNumber":"9962393","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509809/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally Optimal Channel Assignment for Non-Cooperative Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-5-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070633S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4509810,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By relying on users in the network deployment, a wireless community can rapidly deploy a high-quality data access infrastructure in an inexpensive way. But, the coverage of such a network is limited by the set of access points deployed by the users. Currently, it is not clear if this paradigm can serve as a replacement of existing centralized networks operating in licensed bands (such as cellular networks) or if it should be considered as a complimentary service only, with limited coverage. This question currently concerns many wireless network operators. In this paper, we study the dynamics of wireless social community networks by using a simple analytical model. In this model, users choose their service provider based on the subscription fee and the offered coverage. We show how the evolution of social community networks depends on their initial coverage, the subscription fee, and the user preferences for coverage. We conclude that by using an efficient static or dynamic pricing strategy, the wireless social community can obtain a high coverage. Using a game-theoretic approach, we then study a case where the mobile users can choose between the services provided by a licensed band operator and those of a social community. We show that for specific distribution of user preferences, there exists a Nash equilibrium for this non-cooperative game.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509810/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9962394","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509810/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Wireless Social Community Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Wireless Social Community Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-5-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099444S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509812,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A wireless access point (AP) has N latency-sensitive flows, each associated with a deadline and a multicast group of receivers that desire to receive all the packets successfully by their corresponding deadlines. We consider periodic and one-shot models of real-time arrivals. The channel from the AP to each receiver is a wireless erasure channel, independent across users and slots. We wish to find a communication strategy that minimizes the total deadlines missed across all receivers, where a receiver counts a miss if it does not receive a packet by its deadline. We cast this problem as a restless bandit in stochastic control. We use Whittle's relaxation framework for restless bandits to establish Whittle-indexability for multicast realtime scheduling under the assumption of complete feedback from all receivers in every slot. For the Whittle relaxation, we show that for each flow, the AP's decision between transmitting in a slot and idling has a threshold structure. For the homogeneous case where the erasure channel to each receiver is identically distributed with parameter p, the Whittle index of a flow is x\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n(1 - p) , where x\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n is the number of receivers who have yet to receive the current packet of flow i. For the general heterogeneous case in which the erasure channel to receiver j has loss probability p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n, the Whittle index corresponding to each flow is Sigma\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n (1- p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n), where the sum is over all multicast receivers who are yet to receive the packet. We bound the performance of the optimal Whittle relaxation with respect to the optimal wireless multicast real-time scheduler. The heuristic index policy that schedules the flow with the maximum Whittle index in each slot is simple. To relax the complete feedback assumption, we design a scalable mechanism based on statistical estimation theory that obtains the required feedback from all the receivers using a single ACK per packet transmission. The resultant policy is amenable to low-complexity implementation.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.217","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509812.pdf","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Index Policies for Real-Time Multicast Scheduling for Wireless Broadcast Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509812/","displayDocTitle":"Index Policies for Real-Time Multicast Scheduling for Wireless Broadcast Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962396","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509812/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Index Policies for Real-Time Multicast Scheduling for Wireless Broadcast Systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-6-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134358S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509813,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Amongst the class of applications that can be supported is real time video services (such as IPTV, broadcast of live events etc.). These applications are bandwidth hungry and have stringent delay constraints. Thus, scalable support for such applications is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we consider a combination of approaches using multicast, layer encoded video and adaptive modulation of transmissions. Using these, we develop algorithms to ensure efficient, fair and timely delivery of video in WiMAX networks. The corresponding resource allocation problem is challenging because scheduling decisions (within a WiMAX base station) are performed in real-time across two dimensions, time and frequency. Moreover, combining layered video with appropriate modulation calls for novel MAC algorithms. We model the multicast resource allocation problem in WiMAX and demonstrate this problem to be NP-hard. We present a fast greedy algorithm that is (i) provably within a constant approximation of the optimal solution (based on a metric that reflects video quality as perceived by the user), and (ii) performs within 87-95% of the optimal as demonstrated by realistic simulations. We also demonstrate that our algorithm offers a 25% improvement over a naive algorithm. Moreover, in terms of the average rate received by each user, our algorithm out-performs the naive algorithm by more than 50%.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.218","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509813.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Video Multicast in WiMAX Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Video Multicast in WiMAX Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509813/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962397","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509813/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Video Multicast in WiMAX Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y3-6-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063616S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4509817,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Recent work has shown the utility of spatial detection of anomalies via crosslink traffic comparisons. In this paper we identify three advances that are needed to make such methods more useful and practical for network operators. First, anomaly detection methods should avoid global communication and centralized decision making. Second, nonparametric anomaly detection methods are needed to augment current parametric approaches. And finally, such methods should not just identify possible anomalies, but should also annotate each detection with some probabilistic qualifier of its importance. We propose a framework that simultaneously advances the current state of the art on all three fronts. We show that routers can effectively identify volume anomalies through crosslink comparison of traffic observed only on the router's own links. Second, we show that generalized quantile estimators are an effective way to identify high-dimensional sets of local traffic patterns that are potentially anomalous; such methods can be either parametric or nonparametric, and we evaluate both. Third, through the use of false discovery rate as a detection metric, we show that candidate anomalous patterns can be equipped with an estimate of a probability that they truly are anomalous. Overall, our framework provides network operators with an anomaly detection methodology that is distributed, effective, and easily interpretable. Part of the underlying statistical framework, which merges aspects of nonparametric set estimation and multiple hypothesis testing, is novel in itself, although the derivation of that framework is necessarily given elsewhere.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.232","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509827.pdf","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Spatial Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509827/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Spatial Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962410","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509827/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Spatial Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y4-3-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059934S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4509834,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

An adversary can exploit this vulnerability to launch a large number of attacks. For example, an attacker may masquerade as a legitimate access point to disrupt network services or to advertise false services, tricking nearby wireless stations. On the other hand, the received signal strength (RSS) is a measurement that is hard to forge arbitrarily and it is highly correlated to the transmitter's location. Assuming the attacker and the victim are separated by a reasonable distance, RSS can be used to differentiate them to detect MAC spoofing, as recently proposed by several researchers. By analyzing the RSS pattern of typical 802.11 transmitters in a 3-floor building covered by 20 air monitors, we observed that the RSS readings followed a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. We discovered that this phenomenon was mainly due to antenna diversity, a widely-adopted technique to improve the stability and robustness of wireless connectivity. This observation renders existing approaches ineffective because they assume a single RSS source. We propose an approach based on Gaussian mixture models, building RSS profiles for spoofing detection. Experiments on the same testbed show that our method is robust against antenna diversity and significantly outperforms existing approaches. At a 3% false positive rate, we detect 73.4%, 89.6% and 97.8% of attacks using the three proposed algorithms, based on local statistics of a single AM, combining local results from AMs, and global multi-AM detection, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.239","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509834.pdf","startPage":"1768","endPage":"1776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting 802.11 MAC Layer Spoofing Using Received Signal Strength","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509834/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting 802.11 MAC Layer Spoofing Using Received Signal Strength","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962417","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509834/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting 802.11 MAC Layer Spoofing Using Received Signal Strength","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y4-5-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05036S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4509836,"authors":[{"name":"W.

While Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) based solutions serve most of today's high-end routers, they do not scale well for the next-generation. On the other hand, pipelined SRAM- based algorithmic solutions become attractive. Intuitively multiple pipelines can be utilized in parallel to have a multiplicative effect on the throughput. However, several challenges must be addressed for such solutions to realize high throughput. First, the memory distribution across different stages of each pipeline as well as across different pipelines must be balanced. Second, the traffic on various pipelines should be balanced. In this paper, we propose a parallel SRAM-based multi- pipeline architecture for terabit IP lookup. To balance the memory requirement over the stages, a two-level mapping scheme is presented. By trie partitioning and subtrie-to-pipeline mapping, we ensure that each pipeline contains approximately equal number of trie nodes. Then, within each pipeline, a fine-grained node-to-stage mapping is used to achieve evenly distributed memory across the stages. To balance the traffic on different pipelines, both pipelined prefix caching and dynamic subtrie-to-pipeline remapping are employed. Simulation using real-life data shows that the proposed architecture with 8 pipelines can store a core routing table with over 200 K unique routing prefixes using 3.5 MB of memory. It achieves a throughput of up to 3.2 billion packets per second, i.e. 1 Tbps for minimum size (40 bytes) packets.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.241","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509836.pdf","startPage":"1786","endPage":"1794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond TCAMs: An SRAM-Based Parallel Multi-Pipeline Architecture for Terabit IP Lookup","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Beyond TCAMs: An SRAM-Based Parallel Multi-Pipeline Architecture for Terabit IP Lookup","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509836/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962419","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond TCAMs: An SRAM-Based Parallel Multi-Pipeline Architecture for Terabit IP Lookup","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"Y4-6-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063014S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509843,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We investigate various data fusion techniques, focusing on their robustness against Byzantine failures. In contrast to existing data fusion techniques that use a fixed number of samples, we propose a new technique that uses a variable number of samples. The proposed technique, which we call Weighted Sequential Probability Ratio Test (WSPRT), introduces a reputation-based mechanism to the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). We evaluate WSPRT by comparing it with a variety of data fusion techniques under various network operating conditions. Our simulation results indicate that WSPRT is the most robust against the Byzantine failure problem among the data fusion techniques that were considered.","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.251","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509846.pdf","startPage":"1876","endPage":"1884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509846/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509846/","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC1-2-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099797S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"312","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4509851,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In SA networks, secondary (unlicensed) users are allowed to opportunistically utilize idle licensed spectrum bands, thus improving spectrum utilization efficiency and accommodating more users and applications. We take a two- step approach to the problem of maximizing the throughput of an SA network. The first step is to determine a subset of \"candidate\" channels that a secondary device will consider for its channel-switching. The candidate channels are selected based on their estimated utilization. We then propose channel-aware switching to determine when and where to switch to, among the candidate channels. Wireless channels are assumed to experience independent Rayleigh fading, and modeled with a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model. Our evaluation results show that the proposed channel-aware switching scheme significantly outperforms the traditional forced-switching scheme in terms of average throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Multi-Channel Diversity in Spectrum-Agile Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509851.pdf","startPage":"1921","endPage":"1929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multi-Channel Diversity in Spectrum-Agile Networks","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509851/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multi-Channel Diversity in Spectrum-Agile Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC1-3-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143392S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509864,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Typically, rate adaptation is considered as a MAC layer mechanism in IEEE 802.11. Most previous work relies only on frame losses to infer channel quality, but performs poorly if frame losses are mainly caused by interference. Recently SNR- based rate adaptation schemes have been proposed, but most of them have not been studied in a real environment. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic measurement-based study to confirm that in general SNR is a good prediction tool for channel quality, and identify two key challenges for this to be used in practice: (1) The SNR measures in hardware are often uncalibrated, and thus the SNR thresholds are hardware dependent. (2) The direct prediction from SNR to frame delivery ratio (FDR) is often over optimistic under interference conditions. Based on these observations, we present a novel practical SNR- Guided Rate Adaptation (SGRA) scheme. We implement and evaluate SGRA in a real test-bed and compare it with other three algorithms: ARF, RRAA and HRC. Our results show that SGRA outperforms the other three algorithms in all cases we have tested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509869/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9945293","publicationDate":"April 2008","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509869/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Practical SNR-Guided Rate Adaptation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical SNR-Guided Rate Adaptation","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC2-3-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052046S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509871,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Recently, it has been shown that network coding improves network reliability by reducing the number of packet retransmissions in lossy networks. However, the extent of the reliability benefit of network coding is not known. This paper quantifies the reliability gain of network coding for reliable multicasting in wireless networks, where network coding is most promising. We define the expected number of transmissions per packet as the performance metric for reliability and derive analytical expressions characterizing the performance of network coding. We also analyze the performance of reliability mechanisms based on rateless codes and automatic repeat request (ARQ), and compare them with network coding. We first study network coding performance in an access point model, where an access point broadcasts packets to a group of K receivers over lossy wireless channels. We show that the expected number of transmissions using ARQ, compared to network coding, scales as ominus (log K) as the number of receivers becomes large. We then use the access point model as a building block to study reliable multicast in a tree topology. In addition to scaling results, we derive expressions for the expected number of transmissions for finite multicast groups as well. Our results show that network coding significantly reduces the number of retransmissions in lossy networks compared to an ARQ scheme. However, rateless coding achieves asymptotic performance results similar to that of network coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Gain of Network Coding in Lossy Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509879.pdf","startPage":"2171","endPage":"2179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Gain of Network Coding in Lossy Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509879/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9945298","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Gain of Network Coding in Lossy Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC3-1-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05423S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4509882,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In this paper, by utilizing the predictable mobility patterns of underwater objects, we propose a scheme, called Scalable Localization scheme with mobility prediction (SLMP), for underwater sensor networks. In SLMP, localization is performed in a hierarchical way, and the whole localization process is divided into two parts: anchor node localization and ordinary node localization. During the localization process, every node predicts its future mobility pattern according to its past known location information, and it can estimate its future location based on its predicted mobility pattern. Anchor nodes with known locations in the network will control the whole localization process in order to balance the tradeoff between localization accuracy, localization coverage and communication cost. We conduct extensive simulations, and our results show that SLMP can greatly reduce localization communication cost while maintaining relatively high localization coverage and localization accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9962215","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509882/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Localization with Mobility Prediction for Underwater Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Localization with Mobility Prediction for Underwater Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC3-2-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077097S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509883,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We propose a novel approach termed asynchronous sampling that complements existing study. The key idea of asynchronous sampling is to spread the sampling times of the sensor nodes over the time line instead of performing them in a synchronous manner. Compared with existing strategies, asynchronous sampling introduces another dimension for optimization, without additional computation or communication overhead on sensor nodes. Theoretically, we show that asynchronous sampling benefits sensor networks through increased entropy of the sensory data or reduced reconstruction distortion. Furthermore, we formulate the optimal asynchronous sampling problem for determining the time shifts among the nodes. A heuristic solution, termed O-ASYN, is presented that uses local optimum search to approximate the global optimal solution. Simulation results based on simulated data and real experimental data both demonstrate the entropy increases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wireless sensor networks","Peer to peer computing","Entropy","Capacitive sensors","Costs","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Communications Society","Computer science","Data engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","entropy","optimisation","sampling methods","search problems","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","optimal asynchronous sampling problem","sensory data entropy","reduced reconstruction distortion","O-ASYN heuristic solution","local optimum search","global optimal solution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.288","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509594/4509595/04509883.pdf","startPage":"2207","endPage":"2215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Sampling Benefits Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Sampling Benefits Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509883/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509883/","accessionNumber":"9945300","conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Sampling Benefits Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC3-2-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051922S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4509885,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Thus, the routing scheme basing on the link concept should also be reconsidered to \";truly\"; exploit the potential performance gain introduced by cooperative communication. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of routing selection in network layer and contention avoidance among multiple links in MAC layer for multi-hop wireless networks in a cooperative communication aware network. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to investigate the problem of cooperative communication aware routing in multi-source multi-destination multi-hop wireless networks. Several important concepts, including virtual node, virtual link and virtual link based contention graph are introduced. Basing on those concepts, an optimal cooperative routing is achieved and a distributed routing scheme is proposed after some practical approximations. The simulation results show that our scheme reduces the total transmission power comparing with non-cooperative routing and greatly increases the network throughput comparing with single flow cooperative routings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4509901/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962221","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Routing in Multi-Source Multi-Destination Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Routing in Multi-Source Multi-Destination Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"MC4-2-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061527S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509594","isNumber":"4509595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509594","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4509595","articleId":"4509901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4509905,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

This phenomenon is also prominent in the market of \"bandwidth- on-demand\", since the demand is typically higher during large events. Thus, an unselfish \"social planner\" should deploy a proper pricing scheme to reduce congestions and achieve efficient use of the network (i.e., maximize the \"social welfare\"); whereas a selfish service provider (SP) can exploit the time-preference to increase its revenue. In this paper, we present a model to study the important role of time-preference in network pricing. In this model, each user chooses his access time based on his preference, the congestion level, and the price he would be charged. Without pricing, the \"price of anarchy\" (POA) can be arbitrarily bad. We then derive a simple pricing scheme to maximize the social welfare. Next, from the SP's viewpoint, we consider the revenue- maximizing pricing strategy and its effect on the social welfare. We show that if the SP can differentiate its prices over different users and times, the maximal revenue can be achieved, as well as the maximal social welfare. However, if the SP has insufficient information about the users and can only differentiate its prices over the access times, then the resulting social welfare can be much less than the optimum, especially when there are many low-utility users. Otherwise, the difference is bounded and less significant.","doi":"10.1109/NOMSW.2007.33","publicationTitle":"NOMS Workshops 2008 - IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"NOMS Workshops 2008 - IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4509915/4509916/04509949.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMSW.2007.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Dependent Network Pricing and Bandwidth Trading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509949/","displayDocTitle":"Time-Dependent Network Pricing and Bandwidth Trading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962424","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509949/","conferenceDate":"7-11 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Dependent Network Pricing and Bandwidth Trading","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"PID583445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059269S","chronDate":"7-11 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4509915","isNumber":"4509916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4509915","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4509916","articleId":"4509949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4509983,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Hoyhtya","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Hoyhtya","id":"37297201800"},{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"},{"name":"Aarne Mammela","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarne","lastName":"Mammela","id":"37269630600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2139-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2140-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4509983","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Stochastic processes","Availability","History","Radio control","Data communication","Learning systems","Switches","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","stochastic processes","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive channel selection","cognitive radios","history information","data transmission","periodic-stochastic on-off pattern","pattern classification","learning method","Matlab simulation","network traffic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement with predictive channel selection for cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2008.4509983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509979","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489833/4509979/04509983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2008.4509983","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509983","abstract":"Prediction of future availability times of different channels based on history information helps a cognitive radio (CR) to select the best channels for control and data transmission.

A fundamental problem facing the future wireless systems is where to find suitable spectrum bands to meet the demand of future services. A promising technique to improve the spectrum utilization under a lot of investigation is the cognitive radio (CR) concept. This paper provides an overview of a CR study with discussion on enabling techniques for CR, measurements on current spectrum use, forthcoming standardization activities and some findings from our recent research studies on spectrum sensing, frequency management, and power control. The measurements on current spectrum use have identified that in general the overall spectrum occupancy is low. However, the overall spectrum occupancy does not characterize the actual situation adequately and better measures are needed. International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication sector (ITU-R) has started standards activities on CRs, in particular on the measurement of spectrum occupancy and CR systems in the mobile service, indicating that the inclusion of the CR concept into the future regulatory framework is topical. Reliable spectrum sensing is a crucial task of the CR and proper performance assessment is important. If the future availability times of spectrum holes can be predicted, intelligent channel selection with the predicted channel information can be useful. A power control candidate for the CR system is the truncated inverse power control.","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2008.4509985","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489833/4509979/04509985.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2008.4509985","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motivating overview of cognitive radio: Foundations, regulatory issues and key concepts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-14 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A motivating overview of cognitive radio: Foundations, regulatory issues and key concepts","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509985/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9964394","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"14-14 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motivating overview of cognitive radio: Foundations, regulatory issues and key concepts","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075746S","chronDate":"14-14 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4489833","isNumber":"4509979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489833","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4509979","articleId":"4509985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4509987,"authors":[{"name":"Heli Sarvanko","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Heli","lastName":"Sarvanko","id":"37597031500"},{"name":"Miia Mustonen","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Miia","lastName":"Mustonen","id":"37586524200"},{"name":"Atso Hekkala","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Atso","lastName":"Hekkala","id":"37304183700"},{"name":"Aarne Mammela","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarne","lastName":"Mammela","id":"37269630600"},{"name":"Marja Matinmikko","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marja","lastName":"Matinmikko","id":"37269507300"},{"name":"Marcos Katz","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Katz","id":"37275085300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2139-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2140-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4509987","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Resource management","Radio frequency","FCC","Fluctuations","Radiofrequency identification","Radiofrequency interference","Ultra wideband technology","Power control","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication services","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing techniques","Welch's periodogram","cognitive radios","radio spectrum","frequency channels","energy detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative and noncooperative spectrum sensing techniques using Welch\u2019s periodogram in cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/COGART.2008.4509987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509979","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Workshop on Cognitive Radio and Advanced Spectrum Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489833/4509979/04509987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COGART.2008.4509987","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4509987","abstract":"Radio spectrum deployment is growing considerably.

One method to identify temporarily unused parts of radio spectrum is spectrum sensing. In this paper, we focus on spectrum sensing using Welch's periodogram.

The basic idea is to use supervised learning paradigm to train the ANN. For that a conventional power flow tracing method is used as a teacher. Based on solved load flow and followed by power tracing procedure, the description of inputs and outputs of the training data for the ANN is easily obtained. An artificial neural network is developed to assess which generators are supplying a specific load. Most commonly used feedforward architecture has been chosen for the proposed ANN power transfer allocation technique. Almost all system variables obtained from load flow solutions are utilised as an input to the neural network. Moreover, log-sigmoid activation functions are incorporated in the hidden layer to realise the non linear nature of the power flow allocation. The proposed ANN provides promising results in terms of accuracy and computation time. The IEEE 14-bus network is utilised as a test system to illustrate the effectiveness of the ANN output compared to that of conventional methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4509992/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10028028","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4509992/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identification of source to sink relationship in deregulated power systems using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of source to sink relationship in deregulated power systems using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-04252008-00002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148513S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4494446","isNumber":"4509990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4494446","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4509990","articleId":"4509992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Nanyang Technological University","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"}]
