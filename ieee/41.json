This robot uses a fuzzy logic controller and local navigation strategy. The basis for reactive navigation is provided by the concept of general perception which passes perceptual information of the sensors on to the fuzzy system without modeling walls or obstacles. Thus, no representation of the environment is needed. The rule base of the fuzzy system was designed by hand and then a genetic algorithm applied to find optimum membership functions so that the robot moves at constant distance to the wall, at high speed and as smoothly as possible. Optimization was done using a simulated robot. The results of this simulation proved satisfactorily close to reality when tested in a real robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1995.410047","startPage":"77","endPage":"82 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1995.410047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9179","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.","pdfPath":"/iel2/3225/9179/00410047.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wall following robot with a fuzzy logic controller optimized by a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410047/","displayDocTitle":"A wall following robot with a fuzzy logic controller optimized by a genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"5032663","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wall following robot with a fuzzy logic controller optimized by a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00410047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04717S","chronDate":"20-24 Mar 1995","isNumber":"9179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3225","citationCount":"21","articleId":"410047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":410145,"authors":[{"name":"V.N.

We present an approach that integrates a relational database retrieval system with a color analysis technique. The Chabot project was initiated at our university to study storage and retrieval of a vast collection of digitized images. These images are from the State of California Department of Water Resources. The goal was to integrate a relational database retrieval system with content analysis techniques that would give our querying system a better method for handling images. Our simple color analysis method, if used in conjunction with other search criteria, improves our ability to retrieve images efficiently. The best result is obtained when text-based search criteria are combined with content-based criteria and when a coarse granularity is used for content analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.410150","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/9181/00410150.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.410150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chabot: retrieval from a relational database of images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Chabot: retrieval from a relational database of images","volume":"28","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5066990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chabot: retrieval from a relational database of images","sourcePdf":"00410150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021835S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"374","articleId":"410150","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410153,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

Specifically, our research group has developed an automatic indexing system for captioned pictures of people; the indexing information and other textual information is subsequently used in a content-based image retrieval system. Our approach presents an alternative to traditional face identification systems; it goes beyond a superficial combination of existing text-based and image-based approaches to information retrieval. By understanding the caption accompanying a picture, we can extract information that is useful both for retrieving the picture and for identifying the faces shown. In designing a pictorial database system, two major issues are (1) the amount and type of processing required when inserting new pictures into the database and (2) efficient retrieval schemes for query processing. Our research has focused on developing a computational model for understanding pictures based on accompanying descriptive text. Understanding a picture can be informally defined as the process of identifying relevant people and objects. Several current vision systems employ the idea of top-down control in picture understanding.

In its simplest form, the similar-shape retrieval problem can be stated as, \"retrieve or select all shapes or images that are visually similar to the query shape or the query image's shape\". We focus on databases of 2D shapes-or equivalently, databases of images of flat or almost flat objects. (We use the terms \"object\" and \"shape\" interchangeably). Two common types of 2D objects are rigid objects, which have a single rigid component called a link, and articulated objects, which have two or more rigid components joined by movable (rotating or sliding) joints. An ideal similar-shape retrieval technique must be general enough to handle images of articulated as well as rigid objects. It must be flexible enough to handle simple query images, which have isolated shapes, and complex query images, which have partially visible, overlapping or touching objects. We discuss the central issues in similar-shape retrieval and explain how these issues are resolved in a shape retrieval scheme called FIBSSR (Feature Index-Based Similar-Shape Retrieval). This new similar-shape retrieval system effectively models real-world applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5066992","volume":"28","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Similar-shape retrieval in shape data management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Similar-shape retrieval in shape data management","sourcePdf":"00410154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020972S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"180","articleId":"410154","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":410201,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

With the availability of accurate computer-aided design tools, proper characterization and analysis, this coupling phenomenon could be used to simplify the packaging and fabrication process, to reduce manufacturing cost, and also to add flexibility to the design of multilayer structures in many cases. An accurate and efficient spectral domain approach (SDA) is proposed as a means to study the coupling effect through an arbitrary aperture in a thick common ground plane of multilayer planar circuits. In addition, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is present as an alternate approach to this type of problem and also is used as a validation tool for the spectral domain method because of its simplicity, generality, and accuracy. The proposed methods are applied to different aperture coupled structures for illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.410201","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9182/00410201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.410201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9182","startPage":"921","endPage":"926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic coupling through a thick aperture in multilayer planar circuits using the extended spectral domain approach and finite difference time-domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic coupling through a thick aperture in multilayer planar circuits using the extended spectral domain approach and finite difference time-domain method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410201/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053326","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of electromagnetic coupling through a thick aperture in multilayer planar circuits using the extended spectral domain approach and finite difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00410201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076544S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","articleId":"410201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410202,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

In such layered construction, the radiating aperture, active devices, and signal distribution functions are placed in different layers and involve vertical interconnections. The subarray module described involves a hybrid construction in which conventional wire bonding is utilized for interconnecting devices to the signal distribution layers. As in conventional modules, the devices are mounted on the carrier plates and fully tested before insertion in the module. The radiating elements which are integral to the module housing are connected to the devices through electromagnetic coupling.

This new variant with an integrated uniplanar microstrip-to-coplanar strip line feed is called a V-LTSA. The advantages of these transitions in packaging and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) integration are listed. The two transitions and the feed are modeled using finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The overall agreement between the measured and modeled return-loss and insertion-loss characteristics of two back-to-back transitions is good. The resonance frequencies predicted by the FDTD method are within a few percentage points of the measurements. Furthermore, the V-LTSA with the feed is experimentally shown to have a wide return loss (/spl les/-10 dB) bandwidth, good radiation patterns, and low cross-polarization. The gain of the V-LTSA is 9 dB at the design frequency of 10 GHz. A proof-of-concept package to house the feed is experimentally evaluated and shown to have negligible effect on the antenna characteristics. This type of antenna readily integrates with MMIC packages in an array having a brick architecture. The V-LTSA has potential applications in phased arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.410217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/9182/00410217.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1002","doi":"10.1109/8.410217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated uniplanar transition for linearly tapered slot antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Integrated uniplanar transition for linearly tapered slot antenna","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053336","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated uniplanar transition for linearly tapered slot antenna","sourcePdf":"00410217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036497S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","articleId":"410217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":410218,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Ching Cheng","affiliation":["Radiation Laborator, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Jui-Ching Cheng","id":"37277384800"},{"name":"N.I.

Each stage can be any particular type of network. Previous PSHNN's assume quantized, say, binary outputs. A new type of PSHNN is discussed such that the outputs are allowed to be continuous-valued. The performance of the resulting networks is tested in the problem of predicting speech signal samples from past samples. Three types of networks in which the stages are learned by the delta rule, sequential least-squares, and the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, respectively, are described. In all cases studied, the new networks achieve better performance than linear prediction. A revised BP algorithm is discussed for learning input nonlinearities. When the BP algorithm is to be used, better performance is achieved when a single BP network is replaced by a PSHNN of equal complexity in which each stage is a BP network of smaller complexity than the single BP network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.410348","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410348.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with continuous inputs and outputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410348/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with continuous inputs and outputs","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5048676","pubMedId":"18263394","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with continuous inputs and outputs","sourcePdf":"00410348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034068S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"18","articleId":"410348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":410349,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

Aspects of analog hardware studied are component variability, limited voltage ranges, components (multipliers) that only approximate the computations in the backpropagation algorithm, and capacitive weight decay. It is shown that backpropagation networks can learn to compensate for all these shortcomings of analog circuits except for zero offsets, and the latter are correctable with minor circuit complications. Variability in multiplier gains is not a problem, and learning is still possible despite limited voltage ranges and function approximations. Fixed component variation from fabrication is shown to be less detrimental to learning than component variation due to noise. Weight decay is tolerable provided it is sufficiently small, which implies frequent refreshing by rehearsal on the training data or modest cooling of the circuits. The former approach allows for learning nonstationary problem sets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5048677","pubMedId":"18263395","volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tolerance to analog hardware of on-chip learning in backpropagation networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tolerance to analog hardware of on-chip learning in backpropagation networks","sourcePdf":"00410349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051442S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"48","articleId":"410349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410352,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Next, the analysis results are used as guidelines in developing an efficient synthesis procedure for networks that function as associative memories. A constrained design algorithm is presented that gives completely stable dynamical neural networks sharing some interesting features.

It is guaranteed that in close proximity (Hamming distance one) of the stored patterns there is no other binary equilibrium point. Moreover, the presented method allows one to optimize a design parameter that controls the size of the attraction basins of the stored vectors and the accuracy needed in a digital realization of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5048680","pubMedId":"18263398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A synthesis procedure for brain-state-in-a-box neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synthesis procedure for brain-state-in-a-box neural networks","sourcePdf":"00410352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033724S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"33","articleId":"410352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410355,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Chul Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chonnam National University, Kwangju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Chul Kim","id":"37087172030"},{"name":"M.A. Shanblatt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Shanblatt","id":"37299172000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"410355","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Stochastic resonance","Logic gates","Neural networks","Stochastic processes","Neurons","Probability","State estimation","Logic design","Signal representations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","neural net architecture","parallel architectures","statistical analysis","probability","VLSI","neural chips","pattern classification","character recognition","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical error model","architecture","pulse-mode digital multilayer neural network","pseudo-random pulse sequences","synaptic weights","pulse sequences","logic gates","pulse-mode signal representation","VLSI implementation","feedforward network","pattern classification","character recognition","encoding"]}],"abstract":"A new architecture and a statistical model for a pulse-mode digital multilayer neural network (DMNN) are presented. Algebraic neural operations are replaced by stochastic processes using pseudo-random pulse sequences. Synaptic weights and neuron states are represented as probabilities and estimated as average rates of pulse occurrences in corresponding pulse sequences. A statistical model of error (or noise) is developed to estimate relative accuracy associated with stochastic computing in terms of mean and variance. The stochastic computing technique is implemented with simple logic gates as basic computing elements leading to a high neuron-density on a chip. Furthermore, the use of simple logic gates for neural operations, the pulse-mode signal representation, and the modular design techniques lead to a massively parallel yet compact and flexible network architecture, well suited for VLSI implementation. Any size of a feedforward network can be configured where processing speed is independent of the network size. Multilayer feedforward networks are modeled and applied to pattern classification problems such as encoding and character recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.410355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and statistical model of a pulse-mode digital multilayer neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and statistical model of a pulse-mode digital multilayer neural network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5048683","pubMedId":"18263401","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and statistical model of a pulse-mode digital multilayer neural network","sourcePdf":"00410355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043436S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"26","articleId":"410355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410357,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Crossbar switching is used as an illustration. The set of stable attractors of the dynamical system is identically the set of feasible solutions to the problem. CLP is a general class of NP-complete (Neyman-Pearson) problems intersecting artificial intelligence, symbolic logic, and operations research. Problems which can be formulated as CLP include image segmentation as well as finding spanning trees and Euler tours in a graph. As an example, the UBNN is used to control a crossbar packet switch. The switch control problem is a maximal matching problem which is approximated by the UBNN. As switching speeds push below the nanosecond range, the O(V/sup 3/) time complexity of the maximal matching problem will be prohibitive for large switches. When viewed as an analog circuit, the UBNN scales well, guarantees convergence to a solution of the problem, and converges in near constant time, thus becoming an alternative for large crossbar switch control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.410357","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1139","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410357.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The upper bound neural network and a class of consistent labeling problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Neural networks","Labeling","Switches","Artificial neural networks","Artificial intelligence","Logic","Operations research","Image segmentation","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","neural nets","pattern classification","computational complexity","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["upper bound neural network","consistent labeling problem","NP-complete","artificial intelligence","symbolic logic","operations research","image segmentation","spanning trees","Euler tours","graph","crossbar packet switch","switch control problem","maximal matching problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"The upper bound neural network and a class of consistent labeling problems","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5055272","pubMedId":"18263403","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The upper bound neural network and a class of consistent labeling problems","sourcePdf":"00410357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038028S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","articleId":"410357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":410358,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

Such an option, implemented by means of two rules which can be applied independently of topology, size, and training algorithms of the neural classifier, allows one to improve the classification reliability. It is assumed that a performance function P is defined which, taking into account the requirements of the particular application, evaluates the quality of the classification in terms of recognition, misclassification, and reject rates. Under this assumption the optimal reject threshold value, determining the best trade-off between reject rate and misclassification rate, is the one for which the function P reaches its absolute maximum. No constraints are imposed on the form of P, but the ones necessary in order that P actually measures the quality of the classification process. The reject threshold is evaluated on the basis of some statistical distributions characterizing the behavior of the classifier when operating without reject option; these distributions are computed once the training phase of the net has been completed. The method has been tested with a neural classifier devised for handprinted and multifont printed characters, by using a database of about 300000 samples.

Since a processed image is given as the stable equilibrium point of temporal dynamics, a temporally unstable chip is unusable; and (2) because of the array structure, the node voltage distribution induces spatial dynamics, and the node voltage distribution could behave in a wild manner which is undesirable for image-processing purposes. This paper derives several explicit formulas and relationships for the 2D dynamics, which are useful for the design and analysis of the class of networks of interest.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.410359","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410359.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics of analog image processing neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Neural networks","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Frequency","Sensor arrays","Two dimensional displays","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Energy consumption","Circuit stability","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","large scale integration","voltage distribution","image processing","analogue processing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D spatio-temporal dynamics","analog image processing","neural networks","CMOS LSI","parasitic capacitors","temporal dynamics","MOS transistors","equilibrium point","node voltage distribution","spatial dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics of analog image processing neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5055274","pubMedId":"18263405","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics of analog image processing neural networks","sourcePdf":"00410359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043584S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"8","articleId":"410359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":410360,"authors":[{"name":"F.

An iterative optimization process based on a \"modified local search\" component is complemented with a meta-strategy to realize a discrete dynamical system that discourages limit cycles and the confinement of the search trajectory in a limited portion of the search space. The possible cycles are discouraged by prohibiting (i.e., making tabu) the execution of moves that reverse the ones applied in the most recent part of the search. The prohibition period is adapted in an automated way. The confinement is avoided and a proper exploration is obtained by activating a diversification strategy when too many configurations are repeated excessively often. The RTS method is applicable to nondifferentiable functions, is robust with respect to the random initialization, and effective in continuing the search after local minima. Three tests of the technique on feedforward and feedback systems are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training neural nets with the reactive tabu search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.410361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410361.pdf","startPage":"1185","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Training neural nets with the reactive tabu search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055276","pubMedId":"18263407","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training neural nets with the reactive tabu search","sourcePdf":"00410361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069682S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"73","articleId":"410361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":410362,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Visual binary images of workpieces are characterized according to the number of pixels in progressive subskeleton iterations. Those subskeletons are constructed using a modified Zhou skeleton transform with disk shaped structuring elements. Two coding schemes are proposed to record the pixel counts of succeeding subskeletons with and without lowpass filtering. The coded pixel counts are on-line fed to a supervised neural network that is previously trained by the backpropagation method using flawed and unflawed simulation patterns. The test workpiece is then identified as flawed or unflawed by comparing its coded pixel counts to associated training patterns. Such off-line trainings using simulated patterns avoid the problems of collecting flawed samples. Since both coding schemes tremendously reduce the representative skeleton image data, significant run time in each epoch is saved in the application of neural networks. Experimental results are reported using six different shapes of workpieces to corroborate the proposed approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5055277","pubMedId":"18263408","volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A skeleton and neural network-based approach for identifying cosmetic surface flaws","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A skeleton and neural network-based approach for identifying cosmetic surface flaws","sourcePdf":"00410362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052192S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"8","articleId":"410362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":410363,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Pearlmutter","affiliation":["Learning Systems Department, Siemens AG Corporate Research and Development, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Pearlmutter","id":"37063589900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"410363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":358,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1647},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Computational modeling","Machine learning","History","Output feedback","Equations","Neural networks","Clocks","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Boltzmann machines","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient calculations","dynamic recurrent neural networks","fixed point learning algorithms","recurrent backpropagation","deterministic Boltzmann machines","nonfixed point algorithms","backpropagation through time","Elman's history cutoff","Jordan's output feedback architecture","forward propagation","temporally continuous neural networks","computational complexity","learning speed"]}],"abstract":"Surveys learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks with hidden units and puts the various techniques into a common framework.

Linear recursive identification algorithms applied to this problem are known to converge, provided the regressor vector sequence has the persistency of excitation (PE) property. The main contribution of this paper is formulation and proof of PE conditions on the input variables. In the RBF network identification, the regressor vector is a nonlinear function of these input variables. According to the formulated condition, the inputs provide PE, if they belong to domains around the network node centers. For a two-input network with Gaussian RBF that have typical width and are centered on a regular mesh, these domains cover about 25% of the input domain volume. The authors further generalize the proposed solution of the standard RBF network identification problem and study affine RBF network identification that is important for affine nonlinear system control. For the affine RBF network, the author formulates and proves a PE condition on both the system state parameters and control inputs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the persistency of excitation in radial basis function network identification of nonlinear systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.410365","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/9185/00410365.pdf","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.410365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"On the persistency of excitation in radial basis function network identification of nonlinear systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055280","pubMedId":"18263411","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the persistency of excitation in radial basis function network identification of nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"00410365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049399S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"133","articleId":"410365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":410367,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

By adaptively selecting the learning rate parameters, we show that the m weight vectors in the ALA converge to the first m principle component vectors with almost the same rates. Comparing with the Sanger's generalized Hebbian algorithm (GHA), the ALA can quickly find the desired principal component vectors while the GHA fails to do so.

The finite-volume hybrid-grid (FVHG) algorithm enables unstructured grids to be combined with traditional structured-grid, rectangular-cell, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), thereby considerably reducing the unstructured-mesh overhead in surrounding space. In this letter, a simple technique to interface free-meshed, tetrahedron grids with FDTD is described. The two grids are directly coupled without the need for spatial interpolation. The tetrahedron mesh is defined to terminate on a rectangular surface that may be located very close to the geometry under study. Absorbing boundary conditions are easily applied in the surrounding FDTD grid. This technique provides finite-element modeling flexibility with the benefits of explicit time differencing and limited unstructured-mesh overhead. Multimaterial regions can be solved. The FVHG algorithm has been found to be accurate and generally stable for the long-term, even with complex free meshes generated by advanced solid-modeling software.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interfacing unstructured tetrahedron grids to structured-grid FDTD","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.410398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/9186/00410398.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.410398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Interfacing unstructured tetrahedron grids to structured-grid FDTD","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055372","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interfacing unstructured tetrahedron grids to structured-grid FDTD","sourcePdf":"00410398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037461S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"18","articleId":"410398","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":410401,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

This result benchmarks the lowest noise figure so far reported for a direct-coupled HBT amplifier at X-band frequencies. In addition, an approximate expression for the amplifier noise figure is given that predicts the noise figure to within 0.3 dB over bias and frequency.

The cost function to be minimized is the MBD size, which is an important factor in the case of FPGA synthesis. The method developed is based on a subgraph matching target to reduce the number of nodes of a MBD. The matching relies on the presence of a third terminal value X (don't care) in the MBD in order to represent an incompletely specified function in a single graph. The authors have compared the new method with ESPRESSO with respect to MBD size reduction and multiplexor based synthesis. The results obtained empirically confirm the initial hypothesis that two-level minimization techniques are inadequate for this purpose, and also show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EURDAC.1993.410656","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of EURO-DAC 93 and EURO-VHDL 93- European Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of EURO-DAC 93 and EURO-VHDL 93- European Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3227/9191/00410656.pdf","startPage":"312","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURDAC.1993.410656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=410656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new logic minimization method for multiplexor-based FPGA synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/410656/","displayDocTitle":"A new logic minimization method for multiplexor-based FPGA synthesis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"5043803","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new logic minimization method for multiplexor-based FPGA synthesis","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"00410656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029954S","chronDate":"20-24 Sep 1993","isNumber":"9191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3227","citationCount":"3","articleId":"410656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":410715,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The authors exhibit a strong duality relationship between the performance of a system, and its stability analysis via mean drift. A Performance LP bounds the performance of all stationary non-idling scheduling policies. If it is bounded, then its dual, called the Drift LP, has a feasible solution, which is a copositive matrix. The quadratic form associated with this copositive matrix has a negative drift, allowing the authors to conclude that all stationary non-idling scheduling policies are stable in the very strong sense of having a geometrically converging exponential moment. Some systems satisfy an auxiliary set of linear constraints. Their performance is also bounded by a Performance LP, provided that they are stable, i.e., have a finite first moment for the number of parts. If the Performance LP is infeasible, then the system is unstable. Any feasible solution to the dual of the Performance LP provides a quadratic function with a negative drift. If this quadratic form is copositive, then the system is strongly stable as above. If not, the system is either unstable, or else is highly non-robust in that arbitrarily small perturbations can lead to an unstable system. These results carry over to fluid models, allowing the study of networks with non-exponential distributions. Another LP test of stability avoids a copositivity check. If a Monotone LP is bounded, then the system is stable for all smaller arrival rates. Finally, a Finite Time LP provides transient bounds on the performance of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411003","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9193/00411003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9193","startPage":"524","endPage":"529 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duality and linear programs for stability and performance analysis of queueing networks and scheduling policies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Duality and linear programs for stability and performance analysis of queueing networks and scheduling policies","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411003/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4997782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duality and linear programs for stability and performance analysis of queueing networks and scheduling policies","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044692S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"411003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":411017,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

In this paper. the signals obtained from acoustic emission and power sensors during machining processes are analyzed and a set of feature parameters characterizing the tool wear condition are extracted. In order to realize the realtime tool wear condition monitoring for different cutting conditions, a sensor integration strategy which combines the information from multiple sensors (acoustic emission sensor and power sensor) and machining parameters is proposed. A neural network based on improved back-propogation algorithm is developed and a prototype scheme for realtime identification of tool wear is implemented. Experiments under different conditions have proved that a higher rate of tool wear identification can be achieved by using the sensor integration model with neural network. The results also indicated that the neural network is a very effective method of sensor integration for online monitoring of tool abnormalities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411283","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1051 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9194","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9194/00411283.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time tool wear identification using sensor integration with neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411283/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time tool wear identification using sensor integration with neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5038665","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time tool wear identification using sensor integration with neural network","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031691S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"411283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":411315,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular, the authors consider the case when the evolution of the system is restricted to a subspace h of the corresponding Lie algebra /spl Gscr/, where h is not a subalgebra of /spl Gscr/ and it generates the whole algebra under Lie bracketing. Such systems are referred to as G-Snakes. Away from certain singular configurations of the system, the constraints specify a (partial) connection on a principal fiber bundle, which in turn gives rise to a geometric phase under periodic shape variations. This geometric structure can be exploited in order to solve the nonholonomic motion planning problem for such systems. G-Snakes generalize the concept of nonholonomic variable geometry truss assemblies which are kinematic chains evolving on the special Euclidean group SE(2) under nonholonomic constraints imposed by idler wheels. The authors examine in detail the cases of 3-dimensional groups with real non-abelian Lie algebras such as the Heisenberg group H(3), the special orthogonal group SO(3) and the special linear group SL(2).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411343","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9195/00411343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411343","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"2955","endPage":"2960 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"G-snakes: nonholonomic kinematic chains on Lie groups","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"G-snakes: nonholonomic kinematic chains on Lie groups","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411343/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5027456","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"G-snakes: nonholonomic kinematic chains on Lie groups","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030838S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"21","articleId":"411343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":411371,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

A simple design example based on fixed-order LTI controllers and an L/sub 2/-inequality performance criterion is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411371","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9195/00411371.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411371","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2824 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The unfalsified control concept and learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"The unfalsified control concept and learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411371/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5027428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The unfalsified control concept and learning","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044779S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"13","articleId":"411371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":411384,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Our own experience, largely but not entirely based on model-based simulation studies, suggests that this statement carries a considerable degree of truth. In particular, we have found that the performance of dynamic control structures in the form of recurrent neural networks tends to degrade gracefully as the system is altered from that used during training. We have observed, however, that the degree of robustness does not always correlate positively with the quality of control on the plant used in training. For example, two neural controllers of identical architecture and trained on the same plant to comparable error may, on an independent test, exhibit significantly different degrees of robustness. This has led us to devise a procedure, called multistream training, that makes robustness an explicit goal of training. In the preferred form of this procedure, we train a single controller simultaneously on several plants selected from the expected range, thereby countering the tendency of a serial training process to favor the plant upon which training has most recently been conducted. This paper describes the multistream method and illustrates its use and efficacy with an example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411384","startPage":"2754","endPage":"2759 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9195","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9195/00411384.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training of robust neural controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411384/","displayDocTitle":"Training of robust neural controllers","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5027415","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training of robust neural controllers","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036016S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"12","articleId":"411384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":411393,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To avoid this problem, a new control architecture is proposed. In the framework of this architecture, each segment of the highway is equipped with a congestion controller which, according to a decentralized control law and local measurements, calculates the traffic admission rate beneficial from this segment's point of view. These rates are transmitted to the on-ramps which, according to a control protocol, select the traffic admission rate beneficial from the network's point of view. Thus, the system under consideration is represented by a set of decentralized controllers interacting through the network. It is shown that: (1) the steady states of the system satisfy the so-called max-min fairness property; (2) there exists a set of controller gains that ensure asymptotic stability of these steady states; (3) an adaptive method for the selection of these gains is proposed. Finally results of a numerical investigation, which support the conclusions of the analytical study, are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Road transportation","Communication system traffic control","Control systems","Steady-state","Distributed control","Protocols","Asymptotic stability","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","feedback","decentralised control","asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback control","fair on-ramp metering","highway congestion prevention","decentralized control law","traffic admission rate","max-min fairness property","asymptotic stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411448","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9195/00411448.pdf","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2442 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback control of highway congestion by a fair on-ramp metering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Feedback control of highway congestion by a fair on-ramp metering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411448/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5022014","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback control of highway congestion by a fair on-ramp metering","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030808S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"15","articleId":"411448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":411510,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Two design approaches are performed: the first approach is a decoupled design; and the second approach is a sequential design. The procedures are used to tune an SVC and a thyristor-controlled series compensator to enhance the damping of two inter-area, modes in a 3-area, 6-machine power system. The design results are first obtained when the input signals for the damping controllers are derived from the machine speeds. In a second design, the input signals are synthesized from the local voltage and current measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411583","startPage":"4080","endPage":"4085 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9196/00411583.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust decentralized control design for damping power system oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Robust decentralized control design for damping power system oscillations","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5056933","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411583/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust decentralized control design for damping power system oscillations","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039429S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"15","articleId":"411583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":411606,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Won Lee","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Advanced Control and Inst, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Won Lee","id":"37441002300"},{"name":"Joon-Hwa Lee","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Advanced Control and Inst, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joon-Hwa Lee","id":"37384464100"},{"name":"Wook Hyun Kwon","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Advanced Control and Inst, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wook Hyun Kwon","id":"37276308500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1968-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"411606","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Control systems","Linear systems","Uncertainty","Robustness","Tracking loops","Time varying systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Robust stability","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","uncertain systems","robust control","tracking","closed loop systems","matrix algebra","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking control","uncertain linear systems","time-varying uncertainty","input matrix","state matrix","tracking error","closed loop stability","decaying rate","linear matrix inequalities"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a robust tracking problem for linear systems with time-varying uncertainties in both the state and the input matrices, where the matching condition of the uncertainties is not assumed. We address two cases of uncertainties: norm bounded uncertainties, and block-diagonally structured uncertainties. The conditions under which the tracking error is ultimately bounded and the closed loop stability is guaranteed for all allowable uncertainties, are proposed for the both cases of uncertainties, respectively. There are some free parameters to allow flexibility in determining the bound and the decaying rate of the tracking error. The robust tracking controllers are obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) which are equivalent to the suggested conditions. The bound and the decaying rate of the tracking error can be minimized and maximized via the corresponding LMI problems, respectively. The robust tracking property of the proposed controller is shown by an example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tracking control for uncertain linear systems without matching conditions","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411606","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9196/00411606.pdf","startPage":"4181","endPage":"4186 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Robust tracking control for uncertain linear systems without matching conditions","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5056956","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tracking control for uncertain linear systems without matching conditions","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059102S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"2","articleId":"411606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":411630,"authors":[{"name":"M.

SDGPC is based on a continuous-time state space model with continuous-time quadratic cost function, but the projected future control scenario is assumed to be piecewise constant. In doing so, SDGPC can be implemented digitally without any approximation. By state augmentation, SDGPC produces integral action to track a constant setpoint with zero steady error subject to an unknown constant disturbance. Laguerre filter modeling concepts which have been popular recently in process industry can be integrated into this controller design readily and the resulting sampled-data Laguerre-based GPC (SDLGPC) is suitable for adaptive applications. The closed-loop stability of SDGPC is established and the relation between SDGPC and the discrete-time approach is analyzed.

Improvements in technologies for machine vision-based surveillance and high-level symbolic reasoning have enabled us to develop a system for detailed, reliable traffic scene analysis. The machine vision component of our system employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle trajectories over a sequence of traffic scene images. The symbolic reasoning component uses a dynamic belief network to make inferences about traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and stalls. In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of the vision and reasoning components as well as their integration into a working prototype. Preliminary results of an implementation on special purpose hardware using C-40 digital signal processors show that near real-time performance can be achieved without further improvements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9196/00411746.pdf","startPage":"3776","endPage":"3781 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards robust automatic traffic scene analysis in real-time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Image analysis","Remotely operated vehicles","Traffic control","Layout","Mobile robots","Telecommunication traffic","Road accidents","Decision making","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","intelligent control","road traffic","traffic control","automated highways","television applications","inference mechanisms","object recognition","feature extraction","Kalman filters","tracking","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic traffic scene analysis","real-time systems","traffic flow control","machine vision","surveillance","symbolic reasoning","contour tracker","affine motion model","Kalman filters","vehicle trajectory extraction","dynamic belief network","C-40 digital signal processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Towards robust automatic traffic scene analysis in real-time","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5044086","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards robust automatic traffic scene analysis in real-time","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052891S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"54","articleId":"411746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":411748,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The system used here is based on Kalman filtering with a B-spline representation of curves to track the silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects. For example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit can be tracked at video-rate without any special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The novel contribution of this paper is a tracking algorithm that uses a bootstrapping technique to learn a stochastic, dynamic model for given motions from example video-streams. Incorporating such a model into the tracking algorithm greatly enhances maximum tracking speed and robustness to distraction from background objects. Experiments with learning both rigid and non-rigid motions, using moving hands and lips, clearly show the increased tracking power resulting from the learned dynamics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1994.411748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1994.411748","startPage":"3788","endPage":"3793 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/3229/9196/00411748.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 33rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to track curves in motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning to track curves in motion","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5044088","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411748/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to track curves in motion","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00411748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065298S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec 1994","isNumber":"9196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3229","citationCount":"12","articleId":"411748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":411877,"authors":[{"name":"K.

O'Dell et al., 1994). The authors' present goal is to implement the field fitting algorithm efficiently on real heart data. A cascade of fitting steps is used: a first order global cartesian fit, followed by an n-th order global prolate spheroidal fit, followed by a local prolate spheroidal fit around each pre-selected test point. Local deformation gradient and strain tensors are then computed by taking directional derivatives of the displacement field at each test point. On a normal human volunteer, the standard deviation of error of the fitting model to the raw tag point displacement data was /spl sim/0.3 mm. Projections of representative image slices following each stage in the cascade provide a graphical validation of the technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/3230/9197/00411908.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"552 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1994.411908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1994.411908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of displacement field fitting for calculating 3D myocardial deformations from parallel-tagged MR images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Image reconstruction","Myocardium","Heart","Capacitive sensors","Tensile stress","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","cardiology","medical image processing","muscle","image reconstruction","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D myocardial deformations reconstruction","parallel-tagged MR images","displacement field fitting","field fitting algorithm","fitting steps cascade","first order global cartesian fit","n-th order global prolate spheroidal fit","local prolate spheroidal fit","pre-selected test point","local deformation gradient","strain tensors","normal human volunteer","error standard deviation","raw tag point displacement data","representative image slices","graphical validation","magnetic resonance imaging","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of displacement field fitting for calculating 3D myocardial deformations from parallel-tagged MR images","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5009295","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of displacement field fitting for calculating 3D myocardial deformations from parallel-tagged MR images","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00411908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031322S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3230","citationCount":"144","articleId":"411908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":411948,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Human-human interaction within the framework of drama and mime was used to elicit gestural behavior suitable for human-machine interaction and to explore human factors issues. Subjects classified as having little or no functional use of their extremities were able to produce a rich repertoire of gestures and mimes involving the arms, head, face, legs, torso, and vocalizations. A gesture subset comprising dynamic arm gestures have been monitored using biomechanical and bioelectric sensors. Neural computing, pattern recognition and multi-sensor fusion techniques are being used to analyze the gestures and to develop a gesture recognition system. Time delay neural networks were able to recognize 14 dynamic arm gestures from a 17 year old male classified as having no functional use of his arms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1994.411955","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","startPage":"458","endPage":"459 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1994.411955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9197","pdfPath":"/iel5/3230/9197/00411955.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Birth disorders","Man machine systems","Bioelectric phenomena","Arm","Pattern recognition","Electric potential","Speech","Human factors","Extremities","Leg"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","medical signal processing","handicapped aids","biomechanics","sensor fusion","backpropagation","pattern classification","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["athetoid cerebral palsy movement","neural networks","human-machine interaction","computer recognition","multimodal expressive abilities","motor impairment","cerebral palsy","severe speech impairment","human-human interaction","drama","mime","gestural behavior","human factors","arms","head","face","legs","torso","biomechanical sensor","neural computing","time delay neural networks","pattern recognition","multi-sensor fusion techniques","vocalizations","gesture subset","dynamic arm gestures","bioelectric sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computer recognition of athetoid cerebral palsy movement using neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/411955/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5004137","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer recognition of athetoid cerebral palsy movement using neural networks","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00411955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.27936S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3230","citationCount":"3","articleId":"411955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":411968,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The system uses a frequency sampling filter, consisting of a comb filter exciting a bank of 167 resonators each spaced at 50 Hz intervals over the frequency range 0 to 8.3 kHz. The output of each resonator is individually adjustable by means of a weighting coefficient. The overall filter characteristic can thus be changed by altering the appropriate coefficient. Real-time applications have been investigated using a number of Texas Instrument series digital signal processing (DSP) chips, allowing the gain response of a hearing aid to be tailored to individual needs.

A vehicle starts at a prespecified point x/sub o/ and follows a unit speed trajectory x(t) inside a region in /spl Rscr//sup m/ until an unspecified time T that the region is exited. A trajectory minimizing a cost function of the form /spl int//sub 0//sup T/ r(x(t))dt+q(x(T)) is sought. The discretized Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to this problem is usually solved using iterative methods. Nevertheless, assuming that the function r is positive, we are able to exploit the problem structure and develop one-pass algorithms for the discretized problem. The first algorithm resembles Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and runs in time O(n log n), where n is the number of grid points. The second algorithm uses a somewhat different discretization and borrows some ideas from a variation of Dial's shortest path algorithm (1969) that we develop here; it runs in time O(n), which is the best possible, under some fairly mild assumptions. Finally, we show that the latter algorithm can be efficiently parallelized: for two-dimensional problems and with p processors, its running time becomes O(n/p), provided that p=O(/spl radic/n/log n).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5068550","volume":"40","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient algorithms for globally optimal trajectories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient algorithms for globally optimal trajectories","sourcePdf":"00412624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034742S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"535","articleId":"412624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":412638,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

In this paper we study the properties of these subgroups when G is cyclic. We exploit the fact that any cyclic group of q elements is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/sub q/ (the ring of integers modulo q) so that we can make use of concepts related to linearity. Our attention is focused mainly on indecomposable cyclic groups (i.e., of prime power order), since they are the elementary \"building blocks\" of any abelian group. In analogy with the usual construction of linear codes over fields, we define a generator matrix and a parity check matrix. Trellis construction and bounds on the minimum Euclidean distance are also investigated. Some examples of coded modulation schemes based on this theory are also exhibited, and their performance evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053365","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear block codes over cyclic groups","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear block codes over cyclic groups","sourcePdf":"00412673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035625S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","articleId":"412673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":412675,"authors":[{"name":"U.

It is also known (perhaps not so widely) that any binary continuous phase-modulated (CPM) signal may be exactly decomposed into the sum of a few PAM waveforms. In this paper we show that this property extends to multilevel CPM signaling. Features of a PAM decomposition are discussed as a function of the alphabet size, the modulation index, and the frequency response of the system. It is found that, especially with signaling schemes with a long memory, the decomposition has so many terms that it becomes unmanageable. For these cases an approximation is proposed with a limited number of terms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition of M-ary CPM signals into PAM waveforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.412675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/9203/00412675.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.412675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=412675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Decomposition of M-ary CPM signals into PAM waveforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053367","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition of M-ary CPM signals into PAM waveforms","sourcePdf":"00412675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037157S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"148","articleId":"412675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":412677,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Two different contexts are studied: fixed-length and variable-length random number generation. The fixed-length results of this paper provide an operational characterization of the inf-entropy rate of a source, defined in Han and Verdu (see ibid., vol.39, no.3, p.752-772, 1993) and the variable-length results characterize the liminf of the entropy rate, thereby establishing a pleasing duality with the fundamental limits of source coding.

For the special case of the optimal maximum-likelihood metric, the corresponding bound is shown to be asymptotically tight in the region where the symmetric cutoff rate approaches its maximum value of log/sub 2/ M (bits-per-channel use). For a finite-state additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel this feature is used to relate the minimum Euclidean distance of an uncoded symmetric system to the corresponding symmetric cutoff rate. The results are demonstrated for AWGN channels corrupted by linear and nonlinear intersymbol interference. They are also used to assess the efficiency of concatenated coding over the 4-ary AWGN channel where the finite-state mechanism is defined by simple rate 1/2, four-state Ungerboeck 4-AM trellis code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053372","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On the generalized symmetric cutoff rate for finite-state channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the generalized symmetric cutoff rate for finite-state channels","sourcePdf":"00412680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037371S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"412680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":412682,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.L.

The basic idea is to achieve a desired error performance progressively in a number of stages. For each decoding stage, the error performance is tightly bounded and the decoding is terminated at the stage where either near-optimum error performance or a desired level of error performance is achieved. As a result, more flexibility in the tradeoff between performance and decoding complexity is provided. The decoding is based on the reordering of the received symbols according to their reliability measure. The statistics of the noise after ordering are evaluated. Based on these statistics, two monotonic properties which dictate the reprocessing strategy are derived. Each codeword is decoded in two steps: (1) hard-decision decoding based on reliability information and (2) reprocessing of the hard-decision-decoded codeword in successive stages until the desired performance is achieved. The reprocessing is based on the monotonic properties of the ordering and is carried out using a cost function. A new resource test tightly related to the reprocessing strategy is introduced to reduce the number of computations at each reprocessing stage. For short codes of lengths N/spl les/32 or medium codes with 32<N/spl les/64 with rate R/spl ges/0.6, near-optimum bit error performance is achieved in two stages of reprocessing with at most a computation complexity of o(K/sup 2/) constructed codewords, where K is the dimension of the code. For longer codes, three or more reprocessing stages are required to achieve near-optimum decoding. However, most of the coding gain is obtained within the first two reprocessing stages for error performances of practical interest. The proposed decoding algorithm applies to any binary linear code, does not require any data storage, and is well suitable for parallel processing. Furthermore, the maximum number of computations required at each reprocessing stage is fixed, which prevents buffer overflow at low SNR.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/18.412683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/9203/00412683.pdf","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.412683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=412683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412683/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5053375","volume":"41","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on ordered statistics","sourcePdf":"00412683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062429S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"338","articleId":"412683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":412686,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

The key characteristic of these new systems, which we refer to as \"spread-signature CDMA\" systems, is that the associated signature sequences are significantly longer than the interval between symbols. Using this approach, the transmission of each symbol of each user is, in effect, spread over a wide temporal and spectral extent, which is efficiently exploited to combat the effects of fading. These systems generalize and improve on the spread-response precoding systems. Both efficient signature sets and efficient receiver structures for such systems are developed. Several aspects of the performance of the resulting spread-signature CDMA systems are presented, including both the achievable bit-error rate characteristics and the effective capacity of such systems. The results suggest that spread-signature CDMA may be an attractive alternative to conventional CDMA in a variety of application scenarios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.412686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.412686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/9203/00412686.pdf","startPage":"1418","endPage":"1438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread-signature CDMA: efficient multiuser communication in the presence of fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Spread-signature CDMA: efficient multiuser communication in the presence of fading","volume":"41","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053378","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread-signature CDMA: efficient multiuser communication in the presence of fading","sourcePdf":"00412686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062874S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"73","articleId":"412686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":412690,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The author obtains an upper bound of the order O(/spl radic/LlnL) for the maximal aperiodic and odd correlation magnitudes for sequences of length L.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.412698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/9203/00412698.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.412698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9203","startPage":"1506","endPage":"1508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the odd and the aperiodic correlation properties of the Kasami sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=412698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the odd and the aperiodic correlation properties of the Kasami sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5053391","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the odd and the aperiodic correlation properties of the Kasami sequences","sourcePdf":"00412698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054295S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","articleId":"412698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":412699,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this technique the energy of an incoming information light signal is spread over a larger spatial domain by a two-dimensional spatial encoder which consists of patterns of (0, 1) or (1, -1). Subsequent decoding, which is obtained by a holographic filter, spatially despreads the energy of information light signal and brings it to a bright focused light spot. Experimental results obtained to demonstrate the encoding, decoding, and multiaccess capability of the proposed holographic CDMA technique are discussed and compared to other all-optical CDMA techniques.

The algorithms are motivated by the random coding principle that an arbitrary selection of code symbols will produce a good code with high probability. One algorithm begins by choosing a relatively small set of codes randomly. The error performance of each of these codes is evaluated using sequential decoding and the code with the best performance among the chosen set is retained. Another algorithm treats the code construction as a combinatorial optimization problem and uses simulated annealing to direct the code search. Trellis codes for 8 PSK and 16 QAM constellations with constraint lengths v up to 20 are obtained. Simulation results with sequential decoding show that these codes reach the channel cutoff rate bound at a BER of 10/sup -5/-10/sup -6/ and achieve 5.0-6.35 dB real coding gains over uncoded systems with the same spectral efficiency and up to 2.0 dB real coding gains over 64 state trellis codes using Viterbi decoding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.412718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.412718","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9204/00412718.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic construction of large constraint length trellis codes for sequential decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic construction of large constraint length trellis codes for sequential decoding","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5060763","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412718/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic construction of large constraint length trellis codes for sequential decoding","sourcePdf":"00412718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038355S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","articleId":"412718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":412719,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It can be observed that most source coding algorithms for voice, audio and images still have correlation in certain bits. Transmission errors in these bits usually account for the significant errors in the reconstructed source signal. This paper proposes a modification of the Viterbi decoding algorithm (VA) for binary trellises which uses a priori or a posteriori information about the source bit probability for better decoding in addition to soft inputs and channel state information. Analytical upper bounds for the BER of convolutional codes for this modified VA (APRI-VA) are given. The algorithm is combined with the soft output viterbi algorithm (SOVA) and an estimator for the residual correlation of the source bits to achieve source-controlled channel decoding for framed source bits. The description is simplified by an algebra for the log-likelihood ratio L(u)=log(P(u=+1)/P(u=-1)) which allows a clear definition of the \"soft\" values of source-, channel-, and decoded bits as well as a simplified description of the traceback version of the SOVA. Applications are given for PCM transmission and the full rate GSM speech codec. For an PCM coded oversampled bandlimited Gaussian source transmitted over Gaussian and Rayleigh channels with convolutional codes the decoding errors are reduced by a factor of 4 to 5 when the APRI-SOVA is used instead of the VA. A simple dynamic Markov correlation estimator is used. With these receiver-only modifications the channel SNR in a bad mobile environment can be lowered by 2 to 4 dB resulting in the same voice quality. Further applications are briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.412719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9204/00412719.pdf","startPage":"2449","endPage":"2457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.412719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Source-controlled channel decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=412719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Source-controlled channel decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412719/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5060752","volume":"43","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source-controlled channel decoding","sourcePdf":"00412719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05107S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"312","articleId":"412719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":412720,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Three approaches for representing the cochannel interference are investigated. These are a precise error probability method, a sum of sinusoids (sinusoidal) model, and a Gaussian interference model. In addition to determining precise results for the performance of QPSK in cochannel interference, we examine the validity of these two interference models in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environments and in different flat fading environments; Rayleigh, Ricean, and Nakagami. Nyquist pulse shaping is considered and the effects of cross channel ISI produced by the cochannel interference are accounted for in the precise interference model. Also accounted for are the random symbol and carrier timing offsets of the interfering signals. Two performance criteria are considered. These are the average bit error rate and the interference penalty. The latter is defined as the increase in signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) required by a system with cochannel interference in order to maintain the same BER as a system without interference.

Previously discussed CDMA architectures would either have to tolerate a high bit error rate or be forced to use long code sequences in networks with even a moderate number of simultaneous users. The use of long sequences lowers the maximum achievable bit rate or places unrealistic requirements on the system hardware. This paper examines some of the possible improvements to system performance that could be realized by combining the CDMA format with external error correcting codes (ECCs) or a PPM format. It is determined that ECCs can be highly effective in lowering the BER, and/or increasing the achievable information bit rate and number of network users. The results are sufficiently encouraging to conclude that one should seriously consider including ECCs in any practical fiberoptic CDMA network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.412723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9204/00412723.pdf","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.412723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel coding for asynchronous fiberoptic CDMA communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Channel coding for asynchronous fiberoptic CDMA communications","volume":"43","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5060756","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412723/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel coding for asynchronous fiberoptic CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"00412723.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077275S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","articleId":"412723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":412726,"authors":[{"name":"U.

For large systems with large timing uncertainties, it has been shown previously that acquisition in the presence of multiple-access interference may impose a significant limitation on capacity. This leads the authors to consider a system in which timing uncertainties are relatively small and to propose an acquisition scheme which exploits this to reduce complexity and acquisition overhead. The proposal may be appropriate for a microcellular environment for personal communications in which CDMA packet transmission is employed for both voice and data. Packetized transmission would imply that the overhead available for acquisition is small, and the large number of microcells would restrict the cost of the acquisition scheme used in the receiver in each microcell. The acquisition time required for a simple serial search scheme may therefore be unacceptably large. On the other hand, while acquisition using a passive matched filter is fast, the filter length required for reliable acquisition is liable to be excessive in terms of cost and complexity. Motivated by these considerations, the authors propose a two-stage acquisition scheme which employs a short programmable matched filter for initial detection, followed by a correlator for verification. Numerical results based on an approximate analysis of acquisition performance in the presence of multiple access interference are employed to compare the scheme with conventional acquisition schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical modeling and performance analysis for a two-stage acquisition scheme for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.412726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/9204/00412726.pdf","startPage":"2511","endPage":"2520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.412726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9204","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=412726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/412726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical modeling and performance analysis for a two-stage acquisition scheme for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5060759","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical modeling and performance analysis for a two-stage acquisition scheme for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA","sourcePdf":"00412726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039782S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","articleId":"412726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":413149,"authors":[{"name":"V.Yu.

All three detectors were of quasi-optical type and had on-chip-integrated-fixed tuned SIS junctions. The tuning ranges of the detectors were selected to cover the interesting region around the superconducting gap frequency of Nb (about 700 GHz). Measurements show detector responses at frequencies above the gap frequency, i.e., up to /spl ap/920 GHz, and that cooling the detectors to 3.1 K improved the direct detection responses about 15% below 700 GHz and about 50% for frequencies up to 800 GHz, compared to the responses at 4.2 K. The 500 GHz SIS detector was also studied in a 440-520 GHz heterodyne receiver set up. Good agreement between modeled tuning circuit characteristics, tuning range of the mixer and the direct detection response bandwidths were found. However, it is essential that the dispersion of the field penetration depth into the superconductor is included in the modeling of the tuning circuits when the detector is operated at frequencies above the superconducting gap.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.413149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/9207/00413149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.413149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9207","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier transform spectrometer studies (300-1000 GHz) of Nb-based quasi-optical SIS detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fourier transform spectrometer studies (300-1000 GHz) of Nb-based quasi-optical SIS detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier transform spectrometer studies (300-1000 GHz) of Nb-based quasi-optical SIS detectors","sourcePdf":"00413149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0602S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"1","articleId":"413149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":413169,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As is well known, the L/sup 2/ norm of the quantization errors is not preserved by nonorthogonal transforms, so the L/sup 2/ reconstruction error may be unacceptably large. However, given the quantizers and synthesis filters, the authors show that this artifact can be eliminated by formulating the coding problem as that of minimizing the L/sup 2/ reconstruction error over the set of possible encoded images. With this new formulation, the coding problem becomes a high-dimensional, discrete optimization problem and features a coupling between the redundancy-removing and quantization operations. A practical solution to the optimization problem is presented in the form of a multiscale relaxation algorithm, using inter- and intrascale quantization noise feedback filters. Bounds on the coding gain over the standard coding technique are derived. A simple extension of the algorithm allows for the use of a weighted L/sup 2/ error criterion and deadband (non-MMSE) quantizers. Experiments using biorthogonal spline filter banks demonstrate appreciable SNR gains over the standard coding technique, and comparable visual improvements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.413171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/9208/00413171.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.413171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"A multiscale relaxation algorithm for SNR maximization in nonorthogonal subband coding","volume":"4","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5055463","pubMedId":"18292023","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413171/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiscale relaxation algorithm for SNR maximization in nonorthogonal subband coding","sourcePdf":"00413171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07214S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","articleId":"413171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":413197,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The shape sensor uses a charged-coupled device video camera mounted to one end of an aluminum beam which is fixed at its other end to the shaft of a stepping motor, forming a simply supported cantilever. The motor accelerates the camera around the residual limb up to a constant angular velocity of 202.3/spl deg//s. During 216/spl deg/ of the constant-velocity portion of rotation, 17 images are captured at intervals of 13.5/spl deg/ and stored electronically to a computer. The images of the residual limb are then processed to produce silhouette contour outlines which are then used to reconstruct the three-dimensional residual limb shape. Using this silhouette imaging method, the sensor could measure the geometry of residual-limb areas susceptible to shape change with a radial resolution of 0.5 mm in a scan-time of 1.07 s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.413197","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00413197.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/9209/00413197.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"253","doi":"10.1109/86.413197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A silhouetting shape sensor for the residual limb of a below-knee amputee","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A silhouetting shape sensor for the residual limb of a below-knee amputee","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5056089","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A silhouetting shape sensor for the residual limb of a below-knee amputee","sourcePdf":"00413197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045162S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"12","articleId":"413197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":413212,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Hierarchical link-sharing allows multiple agencies, protocol families, or traffic types to share the bandwidth on a link in a controlled fashion. Link-sharing and real-time services both require resource management mechanisms at the gateway. Rather than requiring a gateway to implement separate mechanisms for link-sharing and real-time services, the approach in the paper is to view link-sharing and real-time service requirements as simultaneous, and in some respect complementary, constraints at a gateway that can be implemented with a unified set of mechanisms. While it is not possible to completely predict the requirements that might evolve in the Internet over the next decade, the authors argue that controlled link-sharing is an essential component that can provide gateways with the flexibility to accommodate emerging applications and network protocols.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/9210/00413212.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.413212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.413212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-sharing and resource management models for packet networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Communication system traffic control","Bandwidth","Protocols","Internet","Scheduling algorithm","Jacobian matrices","Traffic control","IP networks","Scientific computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication traffic","Internet","computer network management","packet switching","multi-access systems","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource management models","packet networks","hierarchical link-sharing","multiple agencies","protocol families","traffic types","real-time services","gateway","Internet","emerging applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Link-sharing and resource management models for packet networks","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5056065","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-sharing and resource management models for packet networks","sourcePdf":"00413212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031247S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"591","articleId":"413212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":413220,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Linear lightwave networks are all optical networks in which only linear operations are performed on signals in a waveband selective manner. Special constraints arise because of the linearity in the linear lightwave network. The overall problem of finding a path satisfying all the routing constraints for point-to-point connections is shown to be very complex. Owing to the complexity, the overall routing problem is decomposed into several subproblems. In particular, given a request for a point-to-point connection a waveband is first chosen for the call. Two heuristics, MAXBAND which allocates the most used band to a call and another MINBAND (least used band) are studied. Then, the problem of routing in a given waveband is further divided into smaller subproblems of finding a path in the waveband, checking for feasibility of the path in the chosen waveband and channel allocation (within the waveband). For finding paths in a waveband, K-SP, BLOW-UP and MIN-INT algorithms are proposed. A recursive algorithm checks for feasibility of the path on the waveband. Two channel allocation schemes (within a single waveband) MIN and MAX are presented. Simulations show that using MAXBAND (waveband), MIN-INT (path on waveband) and MIN (channel within waveband) policies resulted in the best performance (least blocking).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in a linear lightwave network","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.413220","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/9210/00413220.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.413220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Routing in a linear lightwave network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5056073","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in a linear lightwave network","sourcePdf":"00413220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030554S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"20","articleId":"413220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":413222,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Most schemes proposed so far have ignored the tuning overhead, and they can only schedule fixed-length packet transmissions. To overcome these two difficulties, the authors propose several scheduling algorithms which can reduce the negative impact of tuning overhead and schedule variable-length messages. A separate channel (control channel) is employed for transmission of control packets, and a distributed scheduling algorithm is invoked at each node every time it receives a control packet. By allowing the length of messages to be variable, a long message can be scheduled with a single control packet transmission, instead of fragmenting it into many fixed-length packets, thereby significantly reducing the overhead of control packet transmissions and improving the overall system performance. Three novel scheduling algorithms are proposed, varying in the amount of global information and processing time they need. Two approximate analytical models are formulated to study the effect of tuning time and the effect of having a limited number of data channels. Extensive simulations are conducted. Average message delays are compared for all of the algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5056075","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling variable-length messages in a single-hop multichannel local lightwave network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling variable-length messages in a single-hop multichannel local lightwave network","sourcePdf":"00413222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03687S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"78","articleId":"413222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":413225,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

The functionals considered are the partition coefficient and entropy indexes of Bezdek, the Xie-Beni (1991), and extended Xie-Beni indexes, and the Fukuyama-Sugeno index (1989). Limit analysis indicates, and numerical experiments confirm, that the Fukuyama-Sugeno index is sensitive to both high and low values of m and may be unreliable because of this. Of the indexes tested, the Xie-Beni index provided the best response over a wide range of choices for the number of clusters, (2-10), and for m from 1.01-7. Finally, our calculations suggest that the best choice for m is probably in the interval [1.5, 2.5], whose mean and midpoint, m=2, have often been the preferred choice for many users of FCM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.413225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/9211/00413225.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.413225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On cluster validity for the fuzzy c-means model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413225/","displayDocTitle":"On cluster validity for the fuzzy c-means model","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5049777","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On cluster validity for the fuzzy c-means model","sourcePdf":"00413225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034948S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"1204","articleId":"413225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":413232,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A self-organizing fuzzy identification algorithm (SOFIA) for identifying complex systems such as CO concentration is proposed. The main purpose of SOFIA is to reduce the computational requirement for identifying a fuzzy model. In particular, the authors simplify a procedure for finding the optimal structure of fuzzy partition. The /spl delta/ rule, which is a basic learning method in neural networks, is used for parameter identification of a fuzzy model. SOFIA consists of four stages which effectively realize structure identification and parameter identification. The procedure of SOFIA is concretely demonstrated by a simple example which has been used in some modeling exercises. The identification result shows effectiveness of SOFIA. Next, the authors apply SOFIA to a prediction problem for CO concentration in the air at the busiest traffic intersection in a large city of Japan. Prediction results show that the fuzzy model is much better than a linear model. Furthermore, the authors simulate a control system for keeping CO concentration at a constant level by using the identified fuzzy model. A self-learning method for adaptively modifying controller parameters by /spl delta/ rule is introduced because the dynamics of real CO concentration system changes gradually over a long period of time. Two self-learning controllers are designed in this simulation. One is a self-learning linear PI controller. The other is a self-learning fuzzy PI controller. The authors investigate robustness and adaptability of this control system for disturbance and parameter perturbation of the CO concentration model. Simulation results show that the self-learning fuzzy controller is more robust and adaptive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and control of carbon monoxide concentration using a neuro-fuzzy technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.413233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/9211/00413233.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.413233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and control of carbon monoxide concentration using a neuro-fuzzy technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5049768","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and control of carbon monoxide concentration using a neuro-fuzzy technique","sourcePdf":"00413233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035081S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"131","articleId":"413233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":413234,"authors":[{"name":"I.

This paper deals with a collision avoidance problem in which the controlled object is a ship with inertia which must avoid collision with a moving object. It has proven to be difficult to obtain collision avoidance rules, i.e., steering rules and speed control rules, which coincide with the operator's knowledge. This paper shows that rules of this type can be acquired directly from observational data using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). This paper also shows that the FNN can obtain portions of the fuzzy rules for the inferences of the static and dynamic degrees of danger and the decision table based on the degrees of danger to avoid the moving obstacle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.413234","startPage":"280","endPage":"287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/9211/00413234.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.413234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An acquisition of operator's rules for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Marine vehicles","Velocity control","Neural networks","Knowledge acquisition","Algorithm design and analysis","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["velocity control","fuzzy neural nets","ships","knowledge acquisition","position control","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operator's rules","collision avoidance","fuzzy neural networks","ship","moving object","steering rules","speed control rules","degrees of danger","decision table"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","displayDocTitle":"An acquisition of operator's rules for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5049769","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An acquisition of operator's rules for collision avoidance using fuzzy neural networks","sourcePdf":"00413234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059222S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"27","articleId":"413234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":413235,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In most cases fuzzy control can be seen as an interpolation of a partially specified control function in a vague environment, which reflects the indistinguishability of measurements or control values. In this paper the authors show that equality relations turn out to be the natural way to represent such vague environments and they develop suitable interpolation methods to obtain a control function. As a special case of our approach the authors obtain Mamdani's model and can justify the inference mechanism in this model and the use of triangular membership functions not only for the reason of simplified computations, and they can explain why typical fuzzy partitions are preferred. The authors also obtain a criterion for reasonable defuzzification strategies. The fuzzy control methodology introduced in this paper has been applied successfully in a case study of engine idle speed control for the Volkswagen Golf GTI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Velocity control","Interpolation","Fuzzy sets","Engines","Mathematical model","Fuzzy logic","Inference mechanisms","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","interpolation","inference mechanisms","velocity control","internal combustion engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","equality relations","idle speed control","partially specified control function","vague environment","interpolation methods","Mamdani's model","inference mechanism","triangular membership functions","defuzzification strategies","Volkswagen Golf GTI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.413237","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00413237.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/9211/00413237.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.413237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy control on the basis of equality relations with an example from idle speed control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy control on the basis of equality relations with an example from idle speed control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413237/","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5049773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy control on the basis of equality relations with an example from idle speed control","sourcePdf":"00413237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040433S","chronDate":"Aug 1995","isNumber":"9211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"51","articleId":"413237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":413239,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When fully polarimetric SAR images are available, the authors propose several approaches to combine the data from different polarizations to achieve even better performance. Wavelet processed imagery is shown to provide better detection performance for the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) based automatic target detection/recognition (ATD/R) problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413278","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9212/00413278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9212","startPage":"75","endPage":"79 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet based speckle reduction with application to SAR based ATD/R","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet based speckle reduction with application to SAR based ATD/R","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413278/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4997550","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet based speckle reduction with application to SAR based ATD/R","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037373S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"105","articleId":"413278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":413280,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

We show how the virtual bellows, which implements the projective group, is an exact model fit to both pan and tilt.

Individual grains are difficult to detect and segment due to size and shape variability and because the background mammogram texture is inhomogeneous. We present a two-stage method based on wavelet transforms for detecting and segmenting calcifications. The first stage consists of a full resolution wavelet transform, which is simply the conventional filter bank implementation without downsampling, so that all sub-bands remain at full size. Four octaves are computed with two inter-octave voices for finer scale resolution. By appropriate selection of the wavelet basis the detection of microcalcifications in the relevant size range can be nearly optimized in the details sub-bands. Detected pixel sites in the LH, HL, and HH sub-bands are heavily weighted before computing the inverse wavelet transform. The LL component is omitted since gross spatial variations are of little interest. Individual microcalcifications are often greatly enhanced in the output image, to the point where straightforward thresholding can be applied to segment them. FROC curves are computed from tests using a well-known database of digitized mammograms. A true positive fraction of 85% is achieved at 0.5 false positives per image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413344","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9212/00413344.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"406 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413344/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammography","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4997616","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transforms for detecting microcalcifications in mammography","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039058S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"8","articleId":"413344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":413367,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The watermark is capable of carrying such information as authentication or authorisation codes, or a legend essential for image interpretation. This capability is envisaged to find application in image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlled access. Two methods of implementation are discussed. The first is based on bit plane manipulation of the LSB, which offers easy and rapid decoding. The second method utilises linear addition of the water mark to the image data, and is more difficult to decode, offering inherent security. This linearity property also allows some image processing, such as averaging, to take place on the image, without corrupting the water mark beyond recovery. Either method is potentially compatible with JPEG and MPEG processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital watermark","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413536","startPage":"86","endPage":"90 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9213","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9213/00413536.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"A digital watermark","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5010122","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital watermark","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022587S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"546","articleId":"413536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":413553,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Usually, a roughness penalty is imposed on the solution. The difficulty is to avoid the smoothing of edges, which are very important attributes of the image. The authors first give sufficient conditions for the design of such an edge-preserving regularization. Under these conditions, it is possible to introduce an auxiliary variable whose role is twofold. Firstly, it marks the discontinuities and ensures their preservation from smoothing. Secondly, it makes the criterion half-quadratic. The optimization is then easier. The authors propose a deterministic strategy, based on alternate minimizations on the image and the auxiliary variable. This yields two algorithms, ARTUR and LEGEND.

Since the proposed method does not depend on line information of a plate it is very robust to boundary deformation. Also, this method is strong enough to deal with a car's image which has many similar regions with a plate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9213/00413580.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"305 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic recognition of a car license plate using color image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Licenses","Color","Character recognition","Neural networks","Histograms","Telecommunication traffic","Roads","Data mining","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","image matching","character recognition","image colour analysis","automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["car license plate","automatic recognition method","color image processing","background colors","input car image","neural network","plate region","vertical length","horizontal length","character recognition","template matching","postprocessing","boundary deformation","car image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Automatic recognition of a car license plate using color image processing","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5010166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic recognition of a car license plate using color image processing","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039094S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"61","articleId":"413580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":413585,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The advantages of our model are its low training time complexity, high utilization of neurons, robust clustering capability, and simple computation; further, a VLSI implementation is highly feasible. By unsupervised learning, our LVQ neural model finds near-optimal clustering from image data and builds a compression codebook in the synaptic weights. The compression results are competitive comparing with the currently popular transform codings such as JPEG and wavelet methods. The neural codebook trained by a few pictures can be used to compression other pictures efficiently. Special image types such as the fingerprints exhibit this property in our experiments. Other experiments involve some filtering effects and techniques to enhance the neural codebook learning to yield higher picture quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413588","startPage":"341","endPage":"345 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9213/00413588.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint image compression by a natural clustering neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Image matching","Image coding","Transform coding","Neural networks","Vector quantization","Neurons","Robustness","Very large scale integration","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector quantisation","image coding","unsupervised learning","computational complexity","self-organising feature maps","fingerprint identification","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing neural network","learning vector quantization","natural clustering neural network","fingerprint image compression","image data compression","still pictures","low training time complexity","robust clustering","neurons","VLSI implementation","unsupervised learning","LVQ neural model","near-optimal clustering","compression codebook","synaptic weights","compression results","filtering effects","neural codebook learning","picture quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint image compression by a natural clustering neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"5010174","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint image compression by a natural clustering neural network","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059639S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"2","articleId":"413588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":413593,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The method is a generalization of a one-dimensional coding scheme which represents signals as linear combinations of signal-dependent time-warped (TW) orthogonal polynomials. This paper briefly summarizes the theory of time-warped signal coding; next, it describes the new image compression method. Basically, this method transforms all of the image rows and columns with different, but not completely independent bases. By adapting the bases to the image, high quality coding is achieved even when retaining only a small number of transform coefficients. Also, the overhead involved in coding the bases is very small. This paper shows that at net bit rates of about 0.3 bpp, images compressed by the new method are sharper and less distorted by ringing effects than those produced by JPEG or the full-image DCT. Block distortion, which is an important problem in JPEG at 0.3 bpp cannot occur in the new method, since it transforms the full image instead of blocks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5010179","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptively subsampled image coding with warped polynomials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptively subsampled image coding with warped polynomials","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026742S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"2","articleId":"413593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":413605,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Gu","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"lastName":"Chuang Gu","id":"37862491400"},{"name":"M.

A 20% gain in contour coding is achieved by applying this filter while the contour location error is within one pixel width.

The main characteristics of the method are (a) storage of image data in self-organizing maps (SOMs) and (b) a dual image representation which requires the reliable automatic identification of interest points; the latter task is solved by a hierarchical analysis/synthesis system based on neural nets. Current work focuses on images of the human face. The new possibilities of storing, encoding and manipulating images are integrated in the \"FaceCoder\" system which is intended to work with image data in the same way as vocoders do with speech data. Sequences of expressions or articulatory movements are \"transferred\" from an image sequence to a still image.

If one is interested in detecting and classifying these signals in the cluttered environment of the ocean, methods must be developed to characterize and categorize these images. The authors concentrate on initial results of exploiting the multiresolution nature of this problem. The concept of multi-dimensional wavelets is most significant as a characterization of the sequential evolution of the image features of these signals. The use of neural networks to classifying underwater acoustic waveforms is not new. The authors take a first step toward the development and application of multiresolution neural networks to this image processing and classification problem. The fundamental neural network will be a bank of three neural networks, each tuned to a different scale of time-frequency resolution. The representations and the networks provide a strong vision analogy to the zoom of visual/recognition acuity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413709","startPage":"931","endPage":"935 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9214","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9214/00413709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of acoustic sequences by multiresolution image processing and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413709/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of acoustic sequences by multiresolution image processing and neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5027324","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of acoustic sequences by multiresolution image processing and neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038761S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","articleId":"413709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":413710,"authors":[{"name":"G.I.

The paper describes work on image sequence classification using the proposed NN-SNAKE and hidden Markov models. The \"snake\" model was applied to extract visual features from a sequence of mouth images and a hidden Markov model was applied to perform word recognition on the visual features. With the visual information alone, the authors were able to achieve 93% recognition rate for 11 isolated words.

Our proposed CDTNN motion estimation approach consists of two stages of efforts. The 3D object is first converted by a CDTNN to a continuous 3D distance transform representation, i.e. the magnitudes of the responding neural network output values are linearly proportional to the distance of the points to the nearest surface of the object. When later presented with surface points of the oriented snapshots of a moving 3D object, this parametric CDTNN representation allows easy accumulation of the orientation mismatch information. More specifically, the mismatch information can be back-propagated through the CDTNN to iteratively determine the best similarity transform (orientation) required to align the oriented object with the represented exemplar object at each time instance.

In general methods for using neural networks for image processing have been largely derived from the use of conventional techniques.

This is achieved by treating the image as a two-dimensional surface and training a network to learn an approximation to the parametric equation which describes this surface. To achieve this goal an image approximation neural network is proposed. This network has a modular architecture to allow the encoding and integration of several separate image regions.

In this method, a multiresolution analysis is applied to textured images to extract a set of intelligible features. These extracted features, in the form of DWT coefficient matrices, are used as inputs to four different multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks and classified. Generalization performance is improved when a locally connected, weight-sharing network topology is utilized, thus drastically decreasing the number of free parameters during training. This architecture takes advantage of the quasi-periodic nature of the textured images. A novel voting network scheme is also employed to achieve a system classification result from the four networks. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated using real-world textured images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413715/","accessionNumber":"5027318","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Texture classification using neural networks and discrete wavelet transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture classification using neural networks and discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Austin, TX","sourcePdf":"00413715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028146S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"7","articleId":"413715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":413717,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Instead, image processing methods may be used to construct a high resolution image from multiple, degraded, low resolution images. It is assumed that the low resolution images have been sub-sampled and displaced by sub-pixel shifts. Therefore, the problem can be divided into three sub-problems: registration (estimating the shifts), restoration, and interpolation. This paper focuses on solving the first two sub-problems simultaneously, using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

The authors show that with this relatively simple feature set, effective texture discrimination can be achieved. In the paper, subband-energy feature sets extracted from the following typical image decompositions are compared: wavelet subband, uniform subband, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and spatial partitioning. The authors report that over 90% correct classification was attained using the feature set in classifying the full Brodatz [1965] collection of 112 textures. Furthermore, the subband energy-based feature set can be readily applied to a system for indexing images by texture content in image databases, since the features can be extracted directly from spatial-frequency decomposed image data. The authors also show that to construct a suitable space for discrimination, Fisher discrimination analysis (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984) can be used to compact the original features into a set of uncorrelated linear discriminant functions. This procedure makes it easier to perform texture-based searches in a database by reducing the dimensionality of the discriminant space. The authors also examine the effects of varying training class size, the number of training classes, the dimension of the discriminant space and number of energy measures used for classification. The authors hope that the performance for texture discrimination of these simple energy-based features will allow images in a database to be efficiently and effectively indexed by contents of their textured regions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/3232/9214/00413817.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"411 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1994.413817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1994.413817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=413817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transform features for texture classification and discrimination in large image databases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image databases","Feature extraction","Discrete cosine transforms","Spatial databases","Image decomposition","Discrete wavelet transforms","Indexing","Data mining","Energy measurement","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image texture","visual databases","indexing","feature extraction","wavelet transforms","discrete cosine transforms","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture classification","discrimination","large image databases","transform features","image subbands","subband-energy feature sets","wavelet subband","uniform subband","discrete cosine transform","spatial partitioning","indexing","spatial-frequency decomposed image data","Fisher discrimination analysis","uncorrelated linear discriminant functions","texture-based searches","dimensionality","discriminant space","training class size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/413817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","displayDocTitle":"Transform features for texture classification and discrimination in large image databases","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5021892","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform features for texture classification and discrimination in large image databases","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00413817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039407S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov 1994","isNumber":"9214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3232","citationCount":"189","articleId":"413817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":413826,"authors":[{"name":"Young Huh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Young Huh","id":"37337543700"},{"name":"J.J.

This system estimates the solutions of 3D motion of an object by interpreting three optical flow (OF - motion vector field calculated from images) patterns of the same object obtained from three different view points. Though the interpretation system is trained using only basic 3D motions consisting of a single motion component, the system can interpret unknown multiple 3D motions consisting of several motion components. The generalization capacity of the proposed system is confirmed using diverse test patterns. Also the robustness of the system to noise is proved experimentally.

Upon passing a polarity detection unit, the output signal of the \"wideband\" integrator is recorded via a digital storage oscilloscope which simultaneously serves as an interface to the subsequent computer-aided evaluation. The personal computer stores the PD-values in a phase resolving PD-matrix. After sufficient learning with training matrices the system recognizes different fault types with high probability. The recognition likelihood of trained patterns is almost 100 percent and of a new pattern approximately 90 percent, depending on both the number of training matrices and the repetition rate. The implemented artificial neural network is composed of a three layer backpropagation algorithm with threshold units and a recognition volume of up to 16 fault types. To guarantee the highest individual detection rate, each fault type must be trained with the same number of matrices. Thereafter, the network is able to recognize previously learned fault types without any other data pre- or post-processing, i.e. the diagnosis system relies exclusively on pattern recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPADM.1994.414091","startPage":"638","endPage":"641 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 4th International Conference on Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials (ICPADM)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3163/9216/00414091.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 4th International Conference on Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials (ICPADM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADM.1994.414091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial-discharge diagnosis with artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Pattern recognition","Impedance measurement","Capacitors","Oscilloscopes","Computer interfaces","Microcomputers","Signal resolution","Backpropagation algorithms","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharges","fault diagnosis","charge measurement","automatic test equipment","insulation testing","backpropagation","image recognition","pattern recognition equipment","electrical engineering computing","analogue processing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial-discharge diagnosis","artificial neural networks","PD measurement system","coupling capacitor","measuring impedance","wideband integrator","polarity detection unit","digital storage oscilloscope","computer-aided evaluation","personal computer","phase resolving PD-matrix","training matrices","fault recognition","recognition likelihood","trained patterns","repetition rate","three layer backpropagation algorithm","threshold units","recognition volume","pattern recognition","3-stage AC cascade","analogue circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Partial-discharge diagnosis with artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 1994","accessionNumber":"5022276","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial-discharge diagnosis with artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00414091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044151S","chronDate":"3-8 Jul 1994","isNumber":"9216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3163","citationCount":"2","articleId":"414091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414502,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochu Xu","affiliation":["Instrumentation Laboratory, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaochu Xu","id":"37088202879"},{"name":"M.S.P.

The advantages of a high temporal resolution, noncontact and noninvasive method are demonstrated during various measurements in several different areas: standing waves on a stripline, ring resonator and voltage waveform characteristics in a high-speed MMIC by the sampling method, long logic pattern signal, voltage waveforms at internal nodes in an ECL IC and those of a transport electrode in CCD by the real-time method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.414508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.414508","startPage":"965","endPage":"971","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/9220/00414508.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling and real-time methods in electro-optic probing system [LSI testing]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Sampling and real-time methods in electro-optic probing system [LSI testing]","publicationDate":"Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5060637","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414508/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling and real-time methods in electro-optic probing system [LSI testing]","sourcePdf":"00414508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037953S","chronDate":"Oct 1995","isNumber":"9220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"27","articleId":"414508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":414544,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This simple device is capable of generating high power signals between 40 and 60 GHz with extremely high spectral purity and stability. The two optical modes produced by this laser are heterodyned on an ultrafast photodiode to give a beat signal at the mode difference frequency. The phase noise of the beat signal is greatly reduced by phase-locking the modes using an electrical drive signal applied to the laser at a subharmonic of the beat frequency. Millimeter-wave signals are obtained with a linewidth of less than 10 Hz, a phase noise of less than -85 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, and a locking range of about 500 MHz. Millimeter-wave fiber-radio systems are seen as a major application area for these new compact optical sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.414575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9222/00414575.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.414575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical generation of millimeter-wave signals for fiber-radio systems using a dual-mode DFB semiconductor laser","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Optical feedback","Optical mixing","Ultrafast optics","Distributed feedback devices","Laser noise","Fiber lasers","Laser feedback","Laser modes","Semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibres","optical transmitters","distributed feedback lasers","semiconductor lasers","laser mode locking","optical modulation","optical fibre networks","broadband networks","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave signals","fiber-radio systems","dual-mode DFB semiconductor laser","optical generation","multisection distributed feedback semiconductor laser","spectral purity","optical modes","heterodyning","ultrafast photodiode","mode difference frequency","phase noise","phase-locked modes","electrical drive signal","linewidth","locking range","40 to 60 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optical generation of millimeter-wave signals for fiber-radio systems using a dual-mode DFB semiconductor laser","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5068610","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414575/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical generation of millimeter-wave signals for fiber-radio systems using a dual-mode DFB semiconductor laser","sourcePdf":"00414575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061176S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"208","articleId":"414575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414580,"authors":[{"name":"V.M.

Currently, aerial light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) systems are therefore preferred for the detection and ranging of objects submerged in the sea. LIDAR provides for large area coverage at high speed, but it lacks coherent detection capability, a shortcoming that severely limits system sensitivity and underwater target contrast. In response to this problem, this paper details the merging of RADAR and LIDAR technologies in the constitution of a hybrid LIDAR-RADAR detection scheme.

The beamformer is used to control an ultrawideband time-steered array antenna, which is a significant improvement over inherently narrowband phased-array antennas. The time-steered transmitter antenna consists of eight broadband spiral elements in a sparsely-populated array. In transmit mode the bandwidth is microwave-component limited to 2-18 GHz. The transmitter shows an unprecedented performance with >100/spl deg/ azimuth steering and no observed squint over the full frequency range. We also extend the beamformer functionality and demonstrate, we believe for the first time, fully-independent dual-beam dual-frequency ultrawideband antenna transmitter operation. Furthermore, the beamformer is shown to be capable of controlling the transmitter under pulsed operation with microwave pulse-widths as short as 75 ps. In the phase-steered receive mode, the antenna is component-limited to two elements and a frequency range of 6-16 GHz. However, we can still demonstrate squint-free receiver steering over >70/spl deg/ azimuth over the full available frequency range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9222/00414593.pdf","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.414593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.414593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"True time-delay fiber-optic control of an ultrawideband array transmitter/receiver with multibeam capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Transmitters","Ultra wideband antennas","Frequency","Antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Broadband antennas","Transmitting antennas","Azimuth","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical delay lines","multibeam antennas","microwave antenna arrays","spiral antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-delay fiber-optic control","time-steered transmitter antenna","multibeam capability","beamformer","fiber-optic dispersive prism","ultrawideband time-steered array antenna","broadband spiral elements","sparsely-populated array","azimuth steering","dual-beam dual-frequency transmitter operation","microwave pulse-widths","phase-steered receive mode","2 to 18 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"True time-delay fiber-optic control of an ultrawideband array transmitter/receiver with multibeam capability","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068629","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"True time-delay fiber-optic control of an ultrawideband array transmitter/receiver with multibeam capability","sourcePdf":"00414593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045792S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"103","articleId":"414593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414594,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Forty-five dB of microwave attenuation was demonstrated with a silicon coplanar waveguide-photoconductive switch, while up to 8.5 dB of attenuation was achieved with a GaAs device. In addition, the optically induced phase delay through the silicon device was observed to be as large as 180/spl deg/. The microwave performance of these photoconductive devices has been fully characterized and their suitability for various optical control applications compared. So that one can optimize the laser diode/GaAs photoconductive device interaction, the GaAs device has been characterized as a function of laser photon energy, switch temperature, and applied dc electric field, and the optimum operating point has been determined through experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical control","Microwave circuits","Gallium arsenide","Optical attenuators","Photoconducting devices","Optical switches","Microwave devices","Silicon","Diode lasers","Optical waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC","photoconducting switches","coplanar waveguides","laser beam applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave-integrated circuits","photoconductive switches","optoelectronic attenuator","planar microwave transmission lines","fiber pigtailed semiconductor laser diode","microwave signal level","microwave attenuation","coplanar waveguide","optically induced phase delay","optical control applications","laser photon energy","GaAs","Si"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414597","doi":"10.1109/22.414597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/9222/00414597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.414597","startPage":"2414","endPage":"2420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical control of microwave-integrated circuits using high-speed GaAs and Si photoconductive switches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optical control of microwave-integrated circuits using high-speed GaAs and Si photoconductive switches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5068633","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical control of microwave-integrated circuits using high-speed GaAs and Si photoconductive switches","sourcePdf":"00414597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037973S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"414597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414608,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The two-dimensional inverse Fourier transformation can also be implemented with only row operations and data transposes. Accordingly, Fourier inversion can easily be implemented on a parallel computer that supports row operations and data transposes on row distributed data. The conditions under which the scan-line implementations are algorithmically equivalent to the original serial computer implementation are described and methods for improving accuracy outside of those conditions are presented.

In monitoring temperature distributions, the biological phenomena of temperature variations of tissue dielectric properties is exploited. By imaging these properties and their changes during such therapies as hyperthermia, temperature distributions can be deduced using difference imaging techniques. The authors focus on a microwave imaging problem where the hybrid element (HE) method is used in conjunction with a dual mesh scheme in an effort to image complex wavenumbers, k/sup 2/. The dual mesh scheme is introduced to improve the reconstructed images of tissue properties and is ideally suited for systems using FE methods as their computational base. Since the electric fields typically vary rapidly over a given body when irradiated by high-frequency electromagnetic sources, a dense mesh is needed for these fields to be accurately represented. Conversely, k/sup 2/ may be fairly constant over subregions of the body which would allow for a less dense sampling of this parameter in those regions. In the dual mesh system employed, the first mesh, which is uniformly dense, is used for calculating the electric fields over the body whereas the second mesh, which is nonuniform and less dense, is used for representing the k/sup 2/ distribution within the region of interest. The authors examine the 2-D TM polarization case for a pair of dielectric distributions on both a large and small problem to demonstrate the flexibility of the dual mesh method along with some of the difficulties associated with larger imaging problems. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the dual mesh concept in comparison to a single mesh approach for a variety of test cases, suggesting that the dual mesh method is critical for FE based image reconstruction where rapidly varying physical quantities are used to recover smoother property profiles, as can occur in microwave imaging of biological bodies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.414616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/9223/00414616.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.414616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual mesh scheme for finite element based reconstruction algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414616/","displayDocTitle":"A dual mesh scheme for finite element based reconstruction algorithms","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5059816","pubMedId":"18215855","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual mesh scheme for finite element based reconstruction algorithms","sourcePdf":"00414616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057908S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"86","articleId":"414616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414618,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanjun Yue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Zhanjun Yue","id":"37088031977"},{"name":"A.

Results of the proposed rib finding algorithm on 10 chest radiographs are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.414618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/9223/00414618.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.414618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic detection of rib borders in chest radiographs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414618/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic detection of rib borders in chest radiographs","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5059818","pubMedId":"18215857","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic detection of rib borders in chest radiographs","sourcePdf":"00414618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06178S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"47","articleId":"414618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414619,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The authors have investigated the use of stepwise discriminant analysis as a feature selection step in the problem of segmenting digital chest radiographs. In this problem, locally calculated features are used to classify pixels into one of several anatomic classes. The feature selection step was used to choose a subset of features which gave performance equivalent to the entire set of candidate features, while utilizing less computational resources. The impact of using the reduced/selected feature set on classifier performance is evaluated for two classifiers: a linear discriminator and a neural network. The results from the reduced/selected feature set were compared to that of the full feature set as well as a randomly selected reduced feature set. The results of the different feature sets were also compared after applying an additional postprocessing step which used a rule-based spatial information heuristic to improve the classification results. This work shows that, in the authors' pattern classification problem, using a feature selection step reduced the number of features used, reduced the processing time requirements, and gave results comparable to the full set of features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.414619","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/9223/00414619.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"547","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.414619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection in the pattern classification problem of digital chest radiograph segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection in the pattern classification problem of digital chest radiograph segmentation","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5059819","pubMedId":"18215858","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection in the pattern classification problem of digital chest radiograph segmentation","sourcePdf":"00414619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04432S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"99","articleId":"414619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":414620,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A correction model assuming circularly symmetric distortion is introduced with the following model parameters: the center of distortion and the coefficients of polynomials representing the distortion correction in the radial direction. If the imaging system is distortion-free, straight lines in the object space should be imaged as straight lines. Based on this criterion, a distorted image of a standard pattern consisting of a grid of several straight lines is recorded, and the model parameters are then estimated as a basis for straightening distorted lines. This method has the advantage of not needing a careful placement of the standard pattern for calibration.

The method involves a window function w/spl circ/ and proceeds in three steps. First, the convolution g/spl circ/=w/spl circ/*f/spl circ/ is computed numerically on a Cartesian grid, using the available samples of f/spl circ/. Then, g=wf is computed via the inverse discrete Fourier transform, and finally f is obtained as g/w. Due to the smoothing effect of the convolution, evaluating w/spl circ/*f/spl circ/ is much less error prone than merely interpolating f/spl circ/. The method was originally devised for image reconstruction in radio astronomy, but is actually applicable to a broad range of reconstructive imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. In particular, it provides a fast and accurate alternative to the filtered backprojection. The basic method has several variants with other applications, such as the equidistant resampling of arbitrarily sampled signals or the fast computation of the Radon (Hough) transform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.414625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/9223/00414625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.414625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9223","startPage":"596","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The gridding method for image reconstruction by Fourier transformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The gridding method for image reconstruction by Fourier transformation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5059825","pubMedId":"18215864","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The gridding method for image reconstruction by Fourier transformation","sourcePdf":"00414625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048412S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"137","articleId":"414625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414634,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The feedback rate to the source from the network is parsimonious, with each feedback bit indicating whether the buffer at a distant switch is above or below a threshold. The service discipline at the switch is first-come-first-served. The important goal of adaptability aims to make all of the network bandwidth available to the active VCs, even though the number of such VCs is variable over a given range. Each VC has two parameters, one giving its minimum guaranteed bandwidth and the other is the weight for determining its share of the uncommitted bandwidth. Judicious selection of these parameters defines distinctive services, such as best effort and best effort with minimum bandwidth. We derive design rules for selecting the parameters of the algorithms such that the appropriate guarantees and fairness properties are exhibited in the dynamical behavior. The systematic use of \"damping\" in right proportion with \"gain\" is shown to be a powerful device for stabilizing behavior and achieving fairness. Our analyses are based on a simple analytic fluid model composed of a system of first-order delay-differential equations, which reflect the propagation delay across the network. Extensive simulations examine the following: (1) fairness, especially to start-up VCs; (2) oscillations; (3) transient behavior, such as the rate of equalization from different initial conditions; (4) disparate bandwidth allocations; (5) multiple paths with diverse propagation delays; (6) adaptability and robustness with respect to parameters; and (7) interoperability of different algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.414645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.414645","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1283","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9224/00414645.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive algorithms for feedback-based flow control in high-speed, wide-area ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive algorithms for feedback-based flow control in high-speed, wide-area ATM networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5075745","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414645/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive algorithms for feedback-based flow control in high-speed, wide-area ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00414645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031376S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"73","articleId":"414645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":414650,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

The algorithm adapts users' transmitter power levels and switches them between cell-sites, and it is shown that the algorithm converges to an allocation of users to cells that is optimal in the sense that interference is minimized. The algorithm is decentralized, and can be considered as a mechanism for cell-site diversity and handover. We provide numerical examples to show how effectively the algorithm relieves local network congestion, by switching users in a heavily congested cell to adjacent, less congested cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/9224/00414650.pdf","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.414650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.414650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm for combined cell-site selection and power control to maximize cellular spread spectrum capacity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Spread spectrum communication","Base stations","Transmitters","Switches","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Communication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","spread spectrum communication","channel capacity","telecommunication congestion control","convergence of numerical methods","interference suppression","cellular radio","diversity reception","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell-site selection","power control","spread spectrum wireless mobile communications","cellular spread spectrum capacity","convergence","user allocation","interference minimisation","decentralized algorithm","cell-site diversity","handover","numerical examples","local network congestion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for combined cell-site selection and power control to maximize cellular spread spectrum capacity","volume":"13","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5075750","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for combined cell-site selection and power control to maximize cellular spread spectrum capacity","sourcePdf":"00414650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042346S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"333","articleId":"414650","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414651,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Several models have been considered including: (1) fixed base station assignment where the assignment of users to base stations is fixed, (2) minimum power assignment where a user is iteratively assigned to the base station at which its signal to interference ratio is highest, and (3) diversity reception where a user's signal is combined from several or perhaps all base stations. For the above models, the uplink power control problem can be reduced to finding a vector p of users' transmitter powers satisfying p/spl ges/I(p) where the jth constraint p/sub j//spl ges/I/sub j/(p) describes the interference that user j must overcome to achieve an acceptable connection. This work unifies results found for these systems by identifying common properties of the interference constraints. It is also shown that systems in which transmitter powers are subject to maximum power limitations share these common properties. These properties permit a general proof of the synchronous and totally asynchronous convergence of the iteration p(t+1)=I(p(t)) to a unique fixed point at which total transmitted power is minimized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","volume":"13","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5075751","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A framework for uplink power control in cellular radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for uplink power control in cellular radio systems","sourcePdf":"00414651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028075S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1751","articleId":"414651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":414652,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The formulation includes the modeling of the underlying randomness in received signal strengths as well as the movements of the mobile. The cost function is designed such that there is a cost associated with switching and a reward for improving the quality of the call. The optimum decision is characterized by a threshold on the difference between the measured power that the mobile receives from the base stations.

Dynamic extinction ratios larger than 13 dB, as well as both data-inverting and noninverting operation are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/9225/00414680.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.414680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.414680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic operation of a three-port, integrated Mach-Zehnder wavelength converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical wavelength conversion","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Probes","Phase modulation","Indium phosphide","Optical filters","Extinction ratio","Chirp modulation","Intensity modulation","Optical interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated optics","optical frequency conversion","semiconductor lasers","wavelength division multiplexing","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic operation","three-port integrated Mach-Zehnder wavelength converter","wavelength conversion","semiconductor optical amplifiers","monolithic integration","three-part Mach-Zehnder configuration","data rates","pump signal power","pump converted signal counter-propagation","two-port configuration","dynamic extinction ratios","data-inverting operation","noninverting operation","1 Gbit/s","2.5 Gbit/s","1534 nm","1539 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic operation of a three-port, integrated Mach-Zehnder wavelength converter","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5070636","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic operation of a three-port, integrated Mach-Zehnder wavelength converter","sourcePdf":"00414680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052785S","chronDate":"Sept.  1995","isNumber":"9225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"41","articleId":"414680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":414682,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The individual output powers were constant to within 1 dB over a 6-dB range of input powers. These results indicate that for a large range of input signal powers it would not be necessary to readjust the EDFA gain equalizer. However, pump power degradation had a stronger impact on gain variation: a 1.4-dB reduction of pump power caused gain variations of 1.8 dB.

Although the FDTD method has existed for nearly 30 years, its popularity continues to grow as computing costs continue to decline. Furthermore, extensions and enhancements to the method are continually being published, which further broaden its appeal. Because of the tremendous amount of FDTD-related research activity, tracking the FDTD literature can be a daunting task. We present a selective survey of FDTD publications. This survey presents some of the significant works that made the FDTD method so popular, and tracks its development up to the present-day state-of-the-art in several areas. An \"on-line\" BibT/sub E/X database, which contains bibliographic information about many FDTD publications, is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/74.414731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/9226/00414731.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.414731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A selective survey of the finite-difference time-domain literature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414731/","displayDocTitle":"A selective survey of the finite-difference time-domain literature","volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1995","accessionNumber":"5097562","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A selective survey of the finite-difference time-domain literature","sourcePdf":"00414731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197669S","chronDate":"Aug.  1995","isNumber":"9226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"148","articleId":"414731","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414766,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The GC estimate is developed as a natural generalization of the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) estimate-a widely used statistic for nonparametric detection of a common signal on two noisy channels. The geometrical nature of the GC estimate is exploited to derive its distribution under the H/sub 0/ hypothesis that the data channels contain independent white Gaussian noise sequences. Detection thresholds corresponding to a range of false alarm probabilities are calculated from this distribution. The relationship of the H/sub 0/ distribution of the GC estimate to that of the determinant of a complex Wishart-distributed matrix is noted. The detection performance of the three-channel GC estimate is evaluated by simulation using a white Gaussian signal sequence in white Gaussian noise. Its performance is compared with that of the multiple coherence (MC) estimate, another nonparametric multiple-channel detection statistic. The GC approach is found to provide better detection performance than the MC approach in terms of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio on all data channels necessary to achieve desired combinations of detection and false alarm probabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A geometric approach to multiple-channel signal detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.414766","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9227/00414766.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.414766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A geometric approach to multiple-channel signal detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071283","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A geometric approach to multiple-channel signal detection","sourcePdf":"00414766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041723S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","articleId":"414766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":414767,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

The proposed method is similar in principle to the notch Fourier transform (NFT) technique suggested by Tadokoro et al. [1987] except that it employs an infinite impulse response (IIR) rather than a finite impulse response (FIR) notch filter parameterization. This modification provides bandwidth controlled bandpass (BP) filters whose center frequencies are equally spaced in the frequency spectrum. In this sense, the proposed technique can be regarded as a constrained notch Fourier transform (CNFT). Sliding algorithms have been derived for both the NFT and CNFT for the purpose of estimating the Fourier coefficients of the sinusoidal components. The paper also proposes a similar algorithm to the CNFT for the signals containing sinusoids at arbitrary known frequencies. The main feature of the modified CNFT is that it uses second-order IIR BP filters whose bandwidth and center frequency can be adjusted independently. The bandwidth control aspect provides the user with an efficient means of achieving the required resolution as well as reducing spectral leakage. In general, the proposed approach leads to considerable reduction in terms of computational burden and memory storage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.414767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9227/00414767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.414767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9227","startPage":"2058","endPage":"2067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constrained notch Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A constrained notch Fourier transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071284","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A constrained notch Fourier transform","sourcePdf":"00414767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106406S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"21","articleId":"414767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":414769,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The author describes a very efficient way to compute the derivatives of each one of these coefficients with respect to the pole position of the Laguerre filter. The knowledge of these derivatives makes possible the computation of high-order approximations to the coefficients in question, such as truncated Taylor series and Pade approximants. The zeros of these approximations are usually good estimates of the location of the stationary points of the SE curve nearer to the center of the approximation. In this way, the position of these stationary points, in particular local minima, can be estimated without resorting to a numerical search algorithm. Both continuous time and discrete time Laguerre filters are discussed, excited either by an impulse or by an arbitrary signal.

Convergence behaviors of finite length Godard and Shalvi-Weinstein equalizers are analyzed, and the potential stable equilibrium points are identified. The existence of undesirable stable equilibria for the finite length Shalvi-Weinstein equalizer is demonstrated through a simple example. It is proven that the points of convergence for both finite length equalizers depend on an initial kurtosis condition. It is also proven that when the length of equalizer is long enough and the initial equalizer setting satisfies the kurtosis condition, the equalizer will converge to a stable equilibrium near a desired global minimum. When the kurtosis condition is not satisfied, generally the equalizer will take longer to converge to a desired equilibrium given sufficiently many parameters and adequate initialization.

This is a mathematical constraint that is not satisfied in many applications. In this paper, we consider situations where the sources are distributed in space with a parametric angular cross-correlation kernel. We propose an algorithm that estimates the parameters of this model using a generalization of the MUSIC algorithm. The method involves maximizing a cost function that depends on a matrix array manifold and the noise eigenvectors. We study two particular cases: coherent and incoherent spatial source distributions. The spatial correlation function for a uniformly distributed signal is derived. From this, we find the array gain and show that (in contrast to point sources) it does not increase linearly with the number of sources. We compare our method to the conventional (point source) MUSIC algorithm. The simulation studies show that the new method outperforms the MUSIC algorithm by reducing the estimation bias and the standard deviation for scenarios with distributed sources. It is also shown that the threshold signal-to-noise ratio required for resolving two closely spaced distributed sources is considerably smaller for the new method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.414777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9227/00414777.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.414777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9227","startPage":"2144","endPage":"2153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric localization of distributed sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parametric localization of distributed sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric localization of distributed sources","sourcePdf":"00414777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027837S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"264","articleId":"414777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":414778,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37735085500"},{"name":"B.

The DEML estimator decouples the multidimensional problem of the exact ML estimator to a set of 1-D problems and, hence, is computationally efficient. We shall derive the asymptotic statistical performance of the DEML estimator and compare the performance with its Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), i.e., the best possible performance for the class of asymptotically unbiased estimators. We will show that the DEML estimator is asymptotically statistically efficient for uncorrelated signals with known waveforms. We will also show that for moderately correlated signals with known waveforms, the DEML estimator is no longer a large sample maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, but the DEML estimator may still be used for angle estimation, and the performance degradation relative to the CRB is small. We shall show that the DEML estimator can also be used to estimate the arrival angles of desired signals with known waveforms in the presence of interfering or jamming signals by modeling the interfering or jamming signals as random processes with an unknown spatial covariance matrix.

This involves calculating a low-dimensional basis set of functions called the maximal invariant, the statistics of which are often tractable to obtain, thereby making analysis feasible and facilitating the search for tests with some optimality property. Using this approach, we obtain a locally most powerful invariant test for the unstructured covariance case and show that all invariant tests can be expressed in terms of the previously published Kelly's generalized likelihood ratio (GLRT) and Robey's adaptive matched filter (AMF) test statistics. Applying this framework to structured covariance matrices, corresponding to stochastic interferers in a known subspace, for which the GLRT is unavailable, we obtain the maximal invariant and propose several new invariant detectors that are shown to perform as well or better than existing ad-hoc detectors. These invariant tests are unaffected by most nuisance parameters, hence the variation in the level of performance is sharply reduced. This framework facilitates the search for such tests even when the usual GLRT is unavailable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximal invariant framework for adaptive detection with structured and unstructured covariance matrices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.414779","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/9227/00414779.pdf","startPage":"2164","endPage":"2175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.414779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"A maximal invariant framework for adaptive detection with structured and unstructured covariance matrices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071296","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximal invariant framework for adaptive detection with structured and unstructured covariance matrices","sourcePdf":"00414779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031342S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","articleId":"414779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":414787,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Applications include high power thyristor controlled reactor and bridge rectifier circuits. The periodic steady states of the circuit are analyzed using a Poincare map and transversality conditions are given to guarantee the smoothness of the Poincare map. A simple and exact formula for the Jacobian of the Poincare map is proved. Account is taken of the varying state space dimension as diodes switch on and off. When the transversality conditions fail, switching times can jump or bifurcate. Examples show that these switching time bifurcations can cause instability of thyristor circuits and mode changes of diode circuits. The simplification of the Jacobian formula is used to explain why the switching time bifurcations occur and are not predicted by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian. Periodic orbits of ideal diode circuits are proved to be stable using Jacobian and incremental energy methods. A source of damping in switching circuits is identified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.414825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/9228/00414825.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.414825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9228","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=414825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of ideal thyristor and diode switching circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability of ideal thyristor and diode switching circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/414825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1995","volume":"42","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1995","accessionNumber":"5071413","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of ideal thyristor and diode switching circuits","sourcePdf":"00414825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04155S","chronDate":"Sep 1995","isNumber":"9228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"32","articleId":"414825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":414879,"authors":[{"name":"G.H.

Evidence for this interest are major research programs in Europe, such as the Technology Initiative for Disabled and Elderly People (TIDE), and the European Prototype for Integrated Care (EPIC), initiated under the general umbrella of the Advanced Informatics in Medicine (AIM) program which has as a major theme the application of Telematics Systems in Health Care. Here, the authors discuss the design and implementation of instrumentation modules for monitoring the interaction between the elderly participant and his or her living environment to assess changes in functional health status. The objectives of the first data collection phase are to develop individualised templates of functional health status and to use knowledge based systems to identify changes which may indicate a deterioration of health and a reduced capacity for coping with the demands of day to day living. This is a major interdisciplinary study involving biomedical design engineers, computer scientists (medical AI) and community medicine specialists. Preliminary data are presented on the results of a small pilot project and a major field trial involving over 75 households.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415207","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel4/3230/9234/00415207.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"909 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/415207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","displayDocTitle":"An instrumentation system for the remote monitoring of changes in functional health status of the elderly at home","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1994","accessionNumber":"5093480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An instrumentation system for the remote monitoring of changes in functional health status of the elderly at home","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00415207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031203S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"9234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3230","citationCount":"35","articleId":"415207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":415318,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

A standard feedforward artificial network was trained (using the backpropagation algorithm) to discriminate amongst four classes of upper-limb movements from the MES, acquired from the biceps and triceps muscles. The approach has demonstrated a powerful means of classifying limb function intent from the MES during natural muscular contraction, but the static nature of the network architecture fails to fully characterize the dynamic structure inherent in the MES. It has been demonstrated previously that a finite-impulse response (FIR) network has the ability to incorporate the temporal structure of a signal, representing the relationships between events in time and providing translation invariance of the relevant feature set. The application of this network architecture to limb function discrimination from the MES is described here.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415339","pdfPath":"/iel4/3230/9234/00415339.pdf","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1094 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Myoelectric signal classification using a finite impulse response neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/415339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1994","displayDocTitle":"Myoelectric signal classification using a finite impulse response neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5105836","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Myoelectric signal classification using a finite impulse response neural network","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00415339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044757S","chronDate":"1994","isNumber":"9234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3230","citationCount":"4","articleId":"415339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":415340,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The authors present a new speaker classifier based on combined neural network and integrate the fuzzy decision and knowledge supervision. Here, they first deal with context-dependent speaker classification. The input speech is sampled at 10 kHz and a 12-order cepstrum is obtained in real-time by a TMS320C25 board. A 2-stage combined neural network is proposed. The first stage is the neural prediction network in order to include the time correlation of the speech signal and to compress and normalize the parameters. The authors use the back-and-forward prediction network. After convergence, the speaker information is embedded in the weights of the predictor. The authors modify the conventional BP algorithm to the fuzzy BP algorithm for training, which has obtained better results. Considering its outstanding ability of characteristic extraction and auto-clustering, the main network is the Self-organizing Feature Map (SOFM). The weights of the predictor become the input of the SOFM which naturally needs no normalization of its input parameters. Using the algorithm proposed by T. Kohonen, the map was rapidly trained and afterwards it is marked for each speaker who says the same word. Then, the characteristics of each speaker are reflected in the map.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415354","startPage":"1123 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel4/3230/9234/00415354.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker classification based on combined neural network and fuzzy decision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Partial response channels","Fuzzy neural networks","Instruments","Speech recognition","Robot control","Communication system control","Control systems","Speaker recognition","Cepstrum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-dependent speaker classification","12-order cepstrum","TMS320C25 board","2-stage combined neural network","speech signal time correlation","back-and-forward prediction network","speaker information","predictor weights","characteristic extraction","auto-clustering","T.

The simultaneous locations of the peaks in the wavelet transforms of the first derivative of the aortic pressure waveform across 2 consecutive scales corresponds to the location of the dicrotic notch. A final algorithm analyzes the transform results and labels the notch point.
