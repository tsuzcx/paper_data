This is reflected within the IEEE 802.15.3a TG, aiming at the definition of a standard for UWB-based high bit rate WPANs. The two main proposals considered in this group are in fact a multi band OFDM approach, based on the transmission of non-impulse OFDM signals combined with frequency hopping (FH), and the direct-sequence (DS) UWB approach, based on impulse radio transmission of UWB DS-coded pulses. In this paper we analyze the ranging capabilities of the two proposals by first determining the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the error in distance estimation using both an ideal channel model and a real channel model taking into account the effect of multipath. Next, we investigate the impact of receiver structure and synchronization sequences adopted in the two proposals on the ranging accuracy. Results show that synchronization sequences play a key role in determining the ranging accuracy. Although the DS-UWB signal is in general best suited for ranging, thanks to its larger bandwidth and its higher frequencies of operation, specific synchronization sequences may in fact lead to better ranging accuracy for the MB-OFDM signal.","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1570003","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01570003.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1570003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","startPage":"302","endPage":"307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower bounds for ranging accuracy with multi band OFDM and direct sequence UWB signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lower bounds for ranging accuracy with multi band OFDM and direct sequence UWB signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570003/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8893450","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570003/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower bounds for ranging accuracy with multi band OFDM and direct sequence UWB signals","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01570003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036123S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1570003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1570004,"authors":[{"name":"Joon-Yong Lee","affiliation":["Handong University, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joon-Yong Lee","id":"37280331400"},{"name":"Sungyul Yoo","affiliation":["Handong University, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sungyul Yoo","id":"37556986600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9397-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"1570004","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570004","abstract":"The extremely fine time resolution of the ultra-wideband (UWB) signal enables accurate ranging based on time delay estimation.

To reduce the time constant of the circuit, we propose a two-stage current-steering topology, in which the distribution of the resistive and capacitive loads is balanced at the two stages. We also propose a folded-cascode current source cell that eliminates the need to control the crossing-points of the switch signals and minimizes the digital feedthrough. The current source cell does this without sacrificing headroom, so the circuit is suitable for a low supply voltage. Post-layout simulation has been performed to estimate performance. At the conversion rate of 5.4 Gsamples/s, the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) is greater than 38 dB for three different signal frequencies.

Next, an iterative scheme for first arrival detection is devised in light of the near-far robustness in multiuser detection.

Since the bandwidth of a received UWB signal is very large, the Nyquist rate sampling becomes impractical, hence motivating lower complexity and yet accurate ranging techniques at feasible sampling rates. In this paper, we consider TOA estimation based on symbol rate samples that are obtained after a square-law device. A normalized threshold selection approach based on the minimum and maximum values of the energy samples is introduced, and optimal values of the thresholds for different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) are investigated via simulations. Also, the effect of window size when searching the leading edge prior to maximum energy block is analyzed. Theoretical closed form expressions are derived for mean absolute TOA estimation error for a fixed threshold case. Performances of different algorithms are then compared via simulations using IEEE 802.15.4a channel models and by choosing appropriate normalized threshold and search-back window parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01570024.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"425","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1570024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1570024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold-based TOA estimation for impulse radio UWB systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time of arrival estimation","Sampling methods","Ultra wideband technology","Pulse shaping methods","Dispersion","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-of-arrival estimation","ultra wideband communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold-based TOA estimation","impulse radio UWB systems","ultrawideband channels","time of arrival estimation","Nyquist rate sampling","threshold selection approach","signal to noise ratios"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Threshold-based TOA estimation for impulse radio UWB systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902046","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold-based TOA estimation for impulse radio UWB systems","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01570024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070166S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1570024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570025,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper we propose a carrier-based UWB system that brings two distinctive advantages over other UWB systems: 1) lower power operation due to the fact that signal processing is optimally partitioned between analog and digital baseband; 2) better spectrum utilization enabling spectrum diversity and multi-user systems. One of the core blocks in this UWB system is the pulser that serves as the transmitter RF front-end and that serves as the template generator in the receiver. We demonstrate a carrier-based low-cost and low-power UWB pulser ASIC fabricated in a 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS digital process.

At receiver side, noncoherent energy detectors (ED) operating at low sampling clock, i.e., below 300 kHz, are focused. Drawback is that EDs suffer from significant performance losses with respect to coherent receivers. Pulse repetition coding (PRC) is a known solution to increase receiver performance at the expense of more transmit power. But in LDR systems known PRC is very inefficient due to the low receiver sampling clock. Boosting transmit power is not possible due to Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) power constraints. Hence, we present a modified PRC scheme solving this problem. Modified repetition coded binary pulse position modulation (MPRC-BPPM) fully exploits FCC power constraints and for EDs of fixed integration duration is optimal with respect to bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, MPRC-BPPM combined with ED outperforms SRAKE receivers at the expense of more transmit power and makes ED's performance robust against strong channel delay spread variations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1570040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01570040.pdf","endPage":"513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified pulse repetition coding boosting energy detector performance in low data rate systems","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1570040","startPage":"508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modified pulse repetition coding boosting energy detector performance in low data rate systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570040/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8893463","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570040/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified pulse repetition coding boosting energy detector performance in low data rate systems","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01570040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052644S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1570040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1570041,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

The high sampling rate is achieved by adopting current steering folding amplifiers instead of cross coupled differential pair based folding amplifiers. Our ADC adopts both resistive interpolation and multiplication to fold the input signal, thereby, reducing the number of folding amplifiers required. When this technique is applied to higher resolution converters, the power and area savings will be even more significant. A brief analysis on the operation of the folding amplifier and a systematic method for sizing preamplifiers, folding amplifiers and comparators is presented. The ADC has been designed in 0.13 /spl mu/m IBM CMOS process. Post layout simulation shows that the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of our ADC is greater than 24 dB up to 540 MHz at 1.4 GS/s and consumes about 62 mW of power. The results also indicate that the proposed architecture consumes less power and achieves a higher sampling rate than existing folding ADCs.","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1570045","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01570045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1570045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","startPage":"536","endPage":"541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a 4-bit 1.4 Gsamples/s low power folding ADC for DS-CDMA UWB transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a 4-bit 1.4 Gsamples/s low power folding ADC for DS-CDMA UWB transceivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570045/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8893452","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a 4-bit 1.4 Gsamples/s low power folding ADC for DS-CDMA UWB transceivers","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01570045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068886S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1570045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1570050,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing Program, NICTA, Australia"],"lastName":"Jian Zhang","id":"37085894378"},{"name":"T.D.

A transmitter modulates one or multiple OFDM subcarriers with a low-frequency (1.05 MHz) ranging signal; and a receiver samples the received signal at a 3.2-MHz sampling rate to estimate the time of arrival of the ranging signal. This configuration and an additional protocol supporting bidirectional ranging achieved a 130-mm resolution (equivalent to 2.15 GHz sampling). This method does not modify the PHY but only changes the baseband signal processing.

More particularly, the modified extended Kalman filter (MEKF) and the modified regularized particle filter (MRPF) enable to track large biases affecting estimated radiolocation metrics due to LOS/NLOS and/or NLOS/NLOS transitions. Simulations were performed with a relevant deterministic UWB propagation model under realistic mobility assumptions. One important corollary for the appealing performances we obtained (e.g. the MEKF provides 90% of time with positioning accuracy better than 0.5 m in a \"moderate walk\" scenario) is that relaxed synchronization strategies could be adopted in UWB localizers. Indeed, the selection of secondary paths in the TOA estimation procedure, and hence, the introduction of large biases: 1) does not contradict the fine capability of UWB signals to resolve multipath profiles; 2) could enable to extend the range of UWB positioning systems in severe NLOS environments by alleviating the constraints on path detectability; and 3) does not degrade significantly the positioning accuracy if the spatial correlation of TOA biases is taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2005.1570063","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/10494/33249/01570063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2005.1570063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33249","startPage":"6 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Bayesian filtering techniques for UWB tracking systems in indoor environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Bayesian filtering techniques for UWB tracking systems in indoor environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8874065","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570063/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Bayesian filtering techniques for UWB tracking systems in indoor environments","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01570063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046056S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10494","isNumber":"33249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10494","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"33249","articleId":"1570063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570065,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Multi band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) is inferentially proposed for personal area networks as well as pulse-based UWB. According to the FCC, both systems is used in same band from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. This paper discusses the effects of interference between pulse-based UWB (p-UWB) and MB-OFDM. The bit-error rate performance is shown assuming that p-UWB and MB-OFDM are utilized at close range. To mitigate the effects of interference from MB-OFDM to p-UWB, multi-carrier template wave techniques and MB-OFDM band sensing in the p-UWB are proposed.

Using passive decomposition, we first decompose the dynamics of multiple slaves into two decoupled systems while preserving energetic passivity: the shape system describing cooperative grasping aspect, and the locked system representing overall behavior of the multiple slaves. Then, by locally controlling the decoupled shape system with the cancellation of disturbances on it, secure and tight (and possibly fixtureless) cooperative grasping can be achieved regardless of the communication-delay and human command. We also construct a bilateral teleoperation loop between the master and the locked system s.t., by operating the master, a human operator can control the overall behavior of the multiple slaves and the grasped object while perceiving environmental forces acting on them. Scattering-based communication is used to passify the master-slave communication-delay. By exploiting the passivity property of the decomposition and scattering-based communication, energetic passivity of the closed-loop system can be ensured, thus, interaction stability and safety are improved significantly.

Approaches addressing the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) typically process the perceived sensor data and do not influence the motion of the mobile robot. In this paper, we present an approach to actively closing loops during exploration. It applies a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to maintain multiple hypotheses about potential trajectories of the robot and corresponding maps. To prevent the particle filter from becoming overly confident, we present a technique to recover the particle diversity after successfully closing a loop. This way the particle depletion problem is avoided. The combination of our approach with the active loop closing strategy allows to deal with multiple nested loops. Experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the advantage of our method over pervious approaches to mapping with Rao-Blackwellized particle filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570192/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recovering Particle Diversity in a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for SLAM After Actively Closing Loops","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovering Particle Diversity in a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for SLAM After Actively Closing Loops","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099022S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1570193,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We show that optimizing the a-optimal information measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches, using a greedy, closed-loop strategy.

The stereo camera head plays a role to get required input images foveated by special wide-angle optics under camera view direction control and 3D head mount display (HMD) displays fused 3D images to the user. Moreover, an analog video signal processing device much inspired from a structure of the human visual system realizes a unique way to provide WAF information to plural processors and the user. Therefore, this developed vision system is also much expected to be applicable for the human brain and vision research, because the design concept is to mimic the human visual system. Further, an algorithm to generate features using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for binocular fixation in order to provide well-fused 3D images to 3D HMD is proposed. This paper examines influences of applying this algorithm to space variant images such as WAF images, based on experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570214","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570214.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Vision System to Induct Binocular Wide-Angle Foveated Information into Both the Human and Computers - Feature Generation Algorithm based on DFT for Binocular Fixation -","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570214/","displayDocTitle":"Machine Vision System to Induct Binocular Wide-Angle Foveated Information into Both the Human and Computers - Feature Generation Algorithm based on DFT for Binocular Fixation -","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570214/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Vision System to Induct Binocular Wide-Angle Foveated Information into Both the Human and Computers - Feature Generation Algorithm based on DFT for Binocular Fixation -","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059653S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1570234,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As the cell is very small, kept in the liquid, and observed through a microscope, the two-dimensional visual feedback makes difficult accurate manipulation in the 3-D world. To improve the manipulation work, we proposed an augmented human-machine interface. A 3-D visual information is provided to the operator through a 3-D reconstruction method using vision-based tracking deformations of the cell embryo. In order to stable injection tasks, the operator needs force feedback and haptic assistance during penetrating the cell envelop, the chorion. The proposed human-machine user\u2019s interface allows real-time realistic visual and haptic control strategies for constrained motion in image coordinates. Virtual haptic rendering allows to constrain the path of insertion and removal in the 3-D scene or to avoid cell destruction by controlling adequately position, velocity and force parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570234/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Realistic Visual and Haptic Rendering for Biological-Cell Injection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic Visual and Haptic Rendering for Biological-Cell Injection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.198728S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1570247,"authors":[{"name":"A. de Luca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universit\u00e1 di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"de Luca","id":"37269180600"},{"name":"R.

The idea is to handle a collision at a generic point along the robot as a fault of its actuating system. A previously developed dynamic FDI (fault detection and isolation) technique is used, which does not require acceleration or force measurements. The actual robot link that has collided can also be identified. Once contact has been detected, it is possible to switch to a suitably defined hybrid force/motion controller that enables to keep the contact, while sliding on the obstacle, and to regulate the interaction force. Simulation results are shown for a two-link planar robot.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"999","endPage":"1004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Robot Collision Detection and Hybrid Force/Motion Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Robot Collision Detection and Hybrid Force/Motion Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570247/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570247/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Robot Collision Detection and Hybrid Force/Motion Control","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048301S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1570252,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This system, until now considered difficult to realize, automates the inspection method utilizing the touching of an inspector's finger. Neural network classifier is applied to the system for products to learn an inspector's finger judgment.

From experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed neural network classifier has been clarified.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570252","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570252.pdf","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1039","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reaction Force Inspection System Using Neural Network Classifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Reaction Force Inspection System Using Neural Network Classifier","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570252/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reaction Force Inspection System Using Neural Network Classifier","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044224S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1570284,"authors":[{"name":"N.D.

While the first two are frequently addressed, the last one has not been studied so much. We present a system that gives a humanoid robot the ability to localize, separate and recognize simultaneous sound sources. A microphone array is used along with a real-time dedicated implementation of Geometric Source Separation (GSS) and a multi-channel post-filter that gives us a further reduction of interferences from other sources. An automatic speech recognizer (ASR) based on the Missing Feature Theory (MFT) recognizes separated sounds in real-time by generating missing feature masks automatically from the post-filtering step. The main advantage of this approach for humanoid robots resides in the fact that the ASR with a clean acoustic model can adapt the distortion of separated sound by consulting the post-filter feature masks. Recognition rates are presented for three simultaneous speakers located at 2m from the robot. Use of both the post-filter and the missing feature mask results in an average reduction in error rate of 42% (relative).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570323/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Robot Speech Recognition Based on Microphone Array Source Separation and Missing Feature Theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Robot Speech Recognition Based on Microphone Array Source Separation and Missing Feature Theory","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053213S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570332,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The goal is to compare the newly acquired skill or task with already existing task knowledge and decide whether to add a new task representation or to expand the existing representation with an alternative. Furthermore, a constraint for the representation is that at execution time the built knowledge base can be integrated and used in a symbolic planner.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive robotics","Humans","Buildings","Scalability","Robot programming","Intelligent robots","Fault tolerance","Intelligent control","Strategic planning","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Modeling of Manipulation Tasks","Programming by Demonstration","Reasoning about Tasks and Skills"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modeling of Manipulation Tasks","Programming by Demonstration","Reasoning about Tasks and Skills"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570332","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570332","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570332","startPage":"1535","endPage":"1540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Cognitive Robots: Building Hierarchical Task Representations of Manipulations from Human Demonstration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Cognitive Robots: Building Hierarchical Task Representations of Manipulations from Human Demonstration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570332/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570332/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Cognitive Robots: Building Hierarchical Task Representations of Manipulations from Human Demonstration","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050851S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570337,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The vision system tracks a moving object, captures a stereo image pair and estimates its distance in only 1ms. It also calculates stereo matching and estimates its 3D shape every 2ms. The high speed linear slider moves stereo cameras horizontally and independently so the baseline length can be changed. We also propose a baseline control method which is adaptive to the distance to the object. When the object appears large in the image, the system reconstructs its 3D shape, and when the object appears small in the image, the system only estimates the 3D position of its center of gravity.

Planning for these procedures is difficult because the needles bend during insertion and cause the surrounding soft tissues to displace and deform. In this paper, we develop a planning algorithm for insertion of highly flexible bevel-tip needles into soft tissues with obstacles in a 2D imaging plane. Given an initial needle insertion plan specifying location, orientation, bevel rotation, and insertion distance, the planner combines soft tissue modeling and numerical optimization to generate a needle insertion plan that compensates for simulated tissue de formations, locally avoids polygonal obstacles, and minimizes needle insertion distance. The simulator computes soft tissue deformations using a finite element model that incorporates the effects of needle tip and frictional forces using a 2D mesh. We formulate the planning problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that is locally minimized using a penalty method that converts the formulation to a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems. We apply the planner to bevel-right and bevel-left needles and generate plans for targets that are unreachable by rigid needles.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570348","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning for Steerable Bevel-tip Needle Insertion Through 2D Soft Tissue with Obstacles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planning for Steerable Bevel-tip Needle Insertion Through 2D Soft Tissue with Obstacles","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning for Steerable Bevel-tip Needle Insertion Through 2D Soft Tissue with Obstacles","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049699S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1570388,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In such cases, initial paths generated for the robots may need to be amended as new information is received that is in conflict with the original maps. The most widely used algorithm for performing this path replanning is Focussed Dynamic A* (D*), which is a generalization of A* for dynamic environments. D* has been shown to be up to two orders of magnitude faster than planning from scratch. In this paper, we present a new replanning algorithm that generates equivalent paths to D* while requiring about half its computation time. Like D*, our algorithm incrementally repairs previous paths and focusses these repairs towards the current robot position. However, it performs these repairs in a novel way that leads to improved efficiency.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570414","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570414.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570414","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2050","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"The Delayed D* Algorithm for Efficient Path Replanning","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Delayed D* Algorithm for Efficient Path Replanning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071665S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1570421,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

We have previously evolved autonomous navigation controllers for fixed wing UAV applications using multi-objective genetic programming (GP). Controllers were evolved to locate a radar source, navigate the UAV to the source efficiently using on-board sensor measurements, and circle around the emitter. We successfully tested an evolved UAV controller on a wheeled mobile robot. A passive sonar system on the robot was used in place of the radar sensor, and a speaker emitting a tone was used as the target in place of a radar. Using the evolved navigation controller, the mobile robot moved to the speaker and circled around it. The results from this experiment demonstrate that our evolved controllers are capable of transference to real vehicles.

The proposed approach consists of incrementally building a Probabilistic Roadmap using information obtained about the workspace topology through the Fluid Dynamic (FD) paradigm based on HFs. The crux of our approach is to identify narrow passages using FD paradigm and pass the information obtained over to a PRM method to build a roadmap to capture the connectivity of free configuration space (C-space) especially in narrow regions. As an extension to our recent works on using Harmonic Function-based Probabilistic Roadmaps (HFPRM) for robotic navigation [1], we propose an Incremental HFPRM (IHFPRM) technique which is more general and can be applied to virtually any type of robot. Simulation results presented in this paper show that the combination of the HF and the PRM works better than each individual in terms of finding a collision free path in environments where narrow passages exist. This technique can be extended to the sensor-based motion planning of robots (mobile and/or articulated) which is the long-term objective in carrying out this research.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570429.pdf","startPage":"2136","endPage":"2141","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incremental Harmonic Function-based Probabilistic Roadmap Approach to Robot Path Planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Motion planning","Hafnium","Fluid dynamics","Orbital robotics","Navigation","Robot sensing systems","Equations","Robot motion","Topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"An Incremental Harmonic Function-based Probabilistic Roadmap Approach to Robot Path Planning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incremental Harmonic Function-based Probabilistic Roadmap Approach to Robot Path Planning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089228S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1570430,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Sampling generation is a difficult issue that entails the challenge of obtaining an incremental and uniform coverage of the configuration space. This objective is even harder when the planning of motions of 3D rigid bodies is tackled, since the corresponding configuration space is SE(3), which requires the careful handling of rotations. This paper proposes a deterministic sampling sequence that generates configurations of SE(3) for the planning of 3D rigid-body motions using sampling-based methods. The proposed sequence is able to generate samples in an incremental low-dispersion manner, giving a good uniform coverage and a lattice structure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570430","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570430.pdf","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2147","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling SE(3) with a Deterministic Sequence for 3D Rigid-Body Path Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Sampling SE(3) with a Deterministic Sequence for 3D Rigid-Body Path Planning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570430/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling SE(3) with a Deterministic Sequence for 3D Rigid-Body Path Planning","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057052S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1570441,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The approach taken builds on well known Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) methodology. In particular, it brings together established representations developed for identification and linearized estimation problems to jointly address feature detection and localization. This provides transparent and scalable integration of sensor information from air and ground platforms. As in previous studies, an Information-theoretic utility measure and local control strategy drive the robots to uncertainty reducing team configurations. Complementary characteristics in terms of coverage and accuracy are revealed through analysis of the observation uncertainty for air and ground on-board cameras. Implementation results for a detection and localization example indicate the ability of this approach to scalably and efficiently realize such collaborative potential.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"2211","endPage":"2216","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570441.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Driven Coordinated Air-Ground Proactive Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570441/","displayDocTitle":"Information Driven Coordinated Air-Ground Proactive Sensing","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Driven Coordinated Air-Ground Proactive Sensing","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058426S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1570447,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution taking into account not only the movement of the robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570477/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving Grid-based SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters by Adaptive Proposals and Selective Resampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Grid-based SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters by Adaptive Proposals and Selective Resampling","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043667S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":1570505,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to overcome some limitations of current prosthetic hands mainly related to the poor functionality and controllability, the prosthetic hand has been designed following a biomechatronic approach based on biologically-inspired design solutions. The core of the project described in this paper is the fabrication of a compliant under-actuated prosthetic hand: the structure of the hand (both palm and fingers) is moulded as a soft polymeric single part with compliant joints and embedded tendon driven underactuated mechanism for providing adaptive grasp. In order to make user trials, the hand is equipped with simple but functional EMG-based control of the single motor incorporated in the hand, and is integrated with a prosthesis socket. The paper presents the biomechatronics design, the fabrication process, the integration of the prosthetic device and first experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cosmetic Prosthetic Hand with Tendon Driven Under-Actuated Mechanism and Compliant Joints: Ongoing Research and Preliminary Results","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570515","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570515.pdf","startPage":"2661","endPage":"2666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Cosmetic Prosthetic Hand with Tendon Driven Under-Actuated Mechanism and Compliant Joints: Ongoing Research and Preliminary Results","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570515/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cosmetic Prosthetic Hand with Tendon Driven Under-Actuated Mechanism and Compliant Joints: Ongoing Research and Preliminary Results","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080482S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1570530,"authors":[{"name":"Jufeng Peng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Jufeng Peng","id":"37280229200"},{"name":"S.

We initially assume each robot's path is specified and decompose it into collision segments and collision-free segments. The collision avoidance constraints for pairs of robots and the dynamics constraints can then be combined to formulate the coordination problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). In this paper, we first show convexity of the constraints for an individual robot path segment under certain assumptions. We next establish that we are guaranteed to find the global optimum of the MINLP because each subproblem of the MINLP is a convex program, based on the convexity result on individual robot segments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on directly obtaining the global optimum coordination of multiple (more than two) robots with dynamics constraints. Finally, we extend these results to the task of coordinating robots on a given roadmap, where the roadmap has multiple candidate paths for each robot. We present an approach to simultaneously select each robot's traversal path and generate its continuous velocity profile. These robot velocity profiles satisfy the dynamics constraints, avoid collisions, and globally minimize the completion time. We use the MINLP Solver [25], which combines a branch-and-bound algorithm with a filterSQP algorithm, to solve the MINLP coordination problems. We illustrate the approach with multiple robot coordination examples with up to 156 collision zones.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"2751","endPage":"2758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinating Multiple Double Integrator Robots on a Roadmap: Convexity and Global Optimality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coordinating Multiple Double Integrator Robots on a Roadmap: Convexity and Global Optimality","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570530/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinating Multiple Double Integrator Robots on a Roadmap: Convexity and Global Optimality","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081306S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570543,"authors":[{"name":"Je Youn Choi","affiliation":["Hanyang University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Sangrok-gu, Ansan, Kyunggi-do, Korea"],"lastName":"Je Youn Choi","id":"37087190034"},{"name":"Byung Rok So","affiliation":["Hanyang University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Sangrok-gu, Ansan, Kyunggi-do, Korea"],"lastName":"Byung Rok So","id":"37087191017"},{"name":"Byung-Ju Yi","affiliation":["Hanyang University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Sangrok-gu, Ansan, Kyunggi-do, Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Ju Yi","id":"37087160810"},{"name":"Wheekuk Kim","affiliation":["Hanyang University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Sangrok-gu, Ansan, Kyunggi-do, Korea"],"lastName":"Wheekuk Kim","id":"37087189632"},{"name":"Il Hong Suh","affiliation":["Hanyang University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Sangrok-gu, Ansan, Kyunggi-do, Korea"],"lastName":"Il Hong Suh","id":"37086974346"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8914-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"1570543","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Aerodynamics","Humans","Manipulator dynamics","Kinematics","Legged locomotion","Joints","Force control","Service robots","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["External Impulse","Impact","Soccer","Trajectory planning","Kicking Robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["External Impulse","Impact","Soccer","Trajectory planning","Kicking Robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570543","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570543.pdf","startPage":"2834","endPage":"2840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact Based Trajectory Planning of a Soccer Ball in a Kicking Robot","abstract":"This paper deals with the trajectory planning of a soccer ball driven by a kicking robot. The trajectory of a ball is function of its initial velocity, launch angle, and some aerodynamic effect. Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted to a ball by a kicking robot is function of robot geometry and dynamic parameters. Initially, we analyze the external impulses for several kicking postures and simulate trajectories for several different kicking conditions. Based on this observation, a trajectory-planning algorithm of a ball, in which the initial velocity and the launch angle of the ball are calculated for a desired trajectory of the ball, is proposed, and then an external impulse required for that motion is calculated and applied to the kicking simulation. The aerodynamic effect such as drag force and lift force is also incorporated into the dynamic simulation of the soccer ball. A kicking robot has been developed for experimental verification of the proposed analytical methodology. It was shown that experimental result is in good agreement with simulation result within 10% error bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570543/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Impact Based Trajectory Planning of a Soccer Ball in a Kicking Robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact Based Trajectory Planning of a Soccer Ball in a Kicking Robot","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102743S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1570561,"authors":[{"name":"Yangmin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macao, China"],"lastName":"Yangmin Li","id":"37279899000"},{"name":"Qingsong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Taipa, Macao, China"],"lastName":"Qingsong Xu","id":"37290823000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8914-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"1570561","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"abstract":"A new three degrees of freedom translational parallel manipulator (TPM) with fixed actuators, called a general 3-PRC TPM, is proposed in this paper.

With the variation on actuators layout angle, the reachable workspace of the manipulator is generated and compared. Especially, it is illustrated that the manipulator in principle possesses a uniform workspace with a constant hexagon shape cross section. Furthermore, the dexterity characteristics is investigated in the global sense.

The defective regions are usually identified through visual judgment with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Dozens of people visually check wafers and hand-mark their defective regions. By this means, potential misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. In addition, the process can incur significant personnel costs. Prior work has proposed automated post-sawing wafer defect inspection that is based on supervised neural networks. Since it requires learned patterns specific to each application, its disadvantage is the lack of product flexibility. Self-Organizing Neural Networks (SONNs) have been proven to have the capabilities of unsupervised auto-clustering.

The design of this snake-like unit is compared to other alternative designs that use a single flexible-backbone and wire-actuation. A unified kinematic and virtual work model is used to perform this comparison between a multi-backbone snake like unit with an equal-diameter snake-like unit using a single flexible backbone and wire actuation. The comparison is presented for several actuation redundancy resolutions that minimize the load on the flexible backbones. The results show that the multi-backbone design is superior to the alternative wire-actuated designs using a single flexible backbone. The advantages manifest in smaller required actuation forces on the backbones and, as a result, a reduced risk of buckling of the backbones and enhanced potential downsize scalability.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570572.pdf","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Snake-Like Units Using Flexible Backbones and Actuation Redundancy for Enhanced Miniaturization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570572/","displayDocTitle":"Snake-Like Units Using Flexible Backbones and Actuation Redundancy for Enhanced Miniaturization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570572/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Snake-Like Units Using Flexible Backbones and Actuation Redundancy for Enhanced Miniaturization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051074S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1570574,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For a trajectory tracking control of snake robots, it is one of the important problem to avoid the singular configuration like a straight line. Using input-ouput linearization for the head position of snake robots based on dynamic model, we can control the head position by PD feedback, but the robot will converge to the singular configuration. In order to solve this problem, we propose a control law that controls shape controllable points for avoiding the singular configuration. Using the proposed control law, the robot can accomplish trajectory tracking of the head position without converging to the singular configuration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570575/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570575/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trajectory Tracking Control of Snake Robots Based on Dynamic Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory Tracking Control of Snake Robots Based on Dynamic Model","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056388S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1570580,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The tool representation described here uses a behavior-based approach to ground the tool affordances in the behavioral repertoire of the robot. The representation is learned during a behavioral babbling stage in which the robot randomly chooses different exploratory behaviors, applies them to the tool, and observes their effects on environmental objects. The paper shows how the autonomously learned affordance representation can be used to solve tool-using tasks by dynamically sequencing the exploratory behaviors based on their expected outcomes. The quality of the learned representation was tested on extension-of-reach tool-using tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570580","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570580.pdf","startPage":"3060","endPage":"3065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Behavior-Grounded Representation of Tool Affordances","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570580/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570580/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior-Grounded Representation of Tool Affordances","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055994S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1570590,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In high-dimensional configuration spaces, a complete exploration is computationally intractable. Practical motion planning algorithms for such high-dimensional spaces must expend computational resources in proportion to the local complexity of configuration space regions. We propose a novel motion planning approach that addresses this problem by building an incremental, approximate model of configuration space. The information contained in this model is used to direct computational resources to difficult regions, effectively addressing the narrow passage problem by adapting the sampling density to the complexity of that region. In addition, the expressiveness of the model permits predictive edge validations, which are performed based on the information contained in the model rather then by invoking a collision checker. Experimental results show that the exploitation of the information obtained through sampling and represented in a predictive model results in a significant decrease in the computational cost of motion planning.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570590","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570590.pdf","startPage":"3120","endPage":"3125","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning Using Predictive Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning Using Predictive Models","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570590/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning Using Predictive Models","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049084S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1570614,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Jones","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Jones","id":"37399406700"},{"name":"I.D.

The second stage selects from the output of the first selection stage the region that can be considered as a potential landmark (model-driven stage). This potential landmark is the input of the attentive stage, that must characterize it and finally determine if this object is a real landmark. The used imaging sensor is a stereo vision system which is capable of providing depth data as well as color images. This stereo vision system is mounted on an autonomous mobile robot and serves map-building and localisation purposes.

Our method allows for the inclusion of constraints in the image as well as in joint space. On-line image Jacobian estimation runs at the same time, and is used to accelerate convergence near the target. We successfully validate this method with simulations under the graphic library OpenGL, and practical experiment with industrial manipulators.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visual servoing","Jacobian matrices","Robot vision systems","Machine vision","Cameras","Cost function","Manipulators","Kinematics","Optimization methods","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual servoing","optimization","uncalibrated visual servoing","model-less visual servoing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visual servoing","optimization","uncalibrated visual servoing","model-less visual servoing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570652","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570652.pdf","startPage":"3504","endPage":"3509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Servoing without Jacobian Using Modified Simplex Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visual Servoing without Jacobian Using Modified Simplex Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570652/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570652/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Servoing without Jacobian Using Modified Simplex Optimization","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054088S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1570660,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In previous works it was found that depending on the shape of the mapped gas distribution (corresponding to different airflow conditions) the gas source location can be sometimes approximated with high accuracy by the maximum in the concentration map while this is not possible in other cases. This paper introduces a method to distinguish both cases by analysing the shape of the obtained concentration map in terms of a model of the time-averaged gas distribution known from physics. The parameters of the model that approximates the concentration map most closely are determined by nonlinear least squares fitting using evolution strategies (ES). The best fit also provides a better estimate of the gas source position in situations where the concentration maximum estimate fails. Different methods to select the most truthful estimate are introduced in this work and a comparison regarding their accuracy is presented, based on a total of 34h of concentration mapping experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570662/","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570662/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model-based Shape Analysis of Gas Concentration Gridmaps for Improved Gas Source Localisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based Shape Analysis of Gas Concentration Gridmaps for Improved Gas Source Localisation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066899S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1570666,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

In order to address these limitations, we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a needle in soft tissue. A bevel (asymmetric) tip causes the needle to bend during insertion, and steering is enhanced when the needle is very flexible. An experimental needle steering robot was designed that includes force/torque sensing, horizontal needle insertion, stereo image data acquisition, and controlled actuation of needle rotation and translation. Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue to determine the effects of insertion velocity and bevel tip angle on the needle path, as well as the forces acting on the needle during insertion. Results indicate that needle steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion velocity, but does depend on bevel tip angle. In addition, the forces acting on the needle are directly related to the insertion velocity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570666/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design Considerations for Robotic Needle Steering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Considerations for Robotic Needle Steering","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047218S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570674,"authors":[{"name":"Shuanghe Yu","affiliation":["Automation Research Center, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Shuanghe Yu","id":"37087184735"},{"name":"G.

The multi-valued hysteresis is analyzed as a single-valued function so that a neural network (NN) can be built to model the hysteresis and its inversion. A sliding mode controller (SMC) augmented with inverse hysteresis model is then developed to compensate the hysteretic behavior, modeling error and disturbance to improve the positioning/tracking stability and accuracy.

In particular, techniques based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Even though RRTs work well on many problems, they have weaknesses which cause them to explore slowly when the sampling domain is not well adapted to the problem. In this paper we characterize these issues and propose a general framework for minimizing their effect. We develop and implement a simple new planner which shows significant improvement over existing RRT-based planners. In the worst cases, the performance appears to be only slightly worse in comparison to the original RRT, and for many problems it performs orders of magnitude better.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570709/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570709/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic-Domain RRTs: Efficient Exploration by Controlling the Sampling Domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic-Domain RRTs: Efficient Exploration by Controlling the Sampling Domain","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069383S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1570711,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The architecture is developed under the premise that UAVs are controlled as a distributed system. The distributed system-based technique maximizes the search and detection capabilities of multiple UAVs. We use a hybrid approach that combines a set of intentional cooperative rules with emerging properties of a swarm to accomplish the objective. The UAVs are equipped only with low-precision RF direction finding sensors and we assume the targets may emit signals randomly with variable duration. Once a target is detected, each UAV optimizes a cost function to determine whether to participate in a cooperative localization task. The cost function balances between the completion of detecting all targets (global search) in the search space and increasing the precision of cooperatively locating already detected targets. A search function for each UAV determines the collective search patterns of collaborating UAVs. Two functions used by each UAV determine (1) the optimal number of UAVs involved in locating targets, (2) the search pattern to detect all targets, and (3) the UAV flight path for an individual UAV. We show the validity of our algorithm using simulation results. Hardware implementation of the strategies is planned for this coming year.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570725/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Developing a Control Architecture for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Search and Localize RF Time-Varying Mobile Targets: Part I","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a Control Architecture for Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Search and Localize RF Time-Varying Mobile Targets: Part I","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057614S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570730,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We have designed a physical awareness system called CAMEO (Camera Assisted Meeting Event Observer), a hardware/software system to record and monitor people's activities in meetings. CAMEO captures a high resolution omnidirectional view of the meeting by stitching images coming from almost concentric cameras. Besides recording capability, CAMEO automatically detects people and learns a person-specific facial appearance model (PS-FAM) for each of the participants. The PSFAMs allow more robust/reliable tracking and identification. In this paper, we describe the video-capturing device, photometric/geometric autocalibration process, and the multiple people tracking system. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system is demonstrated over several real-time experiments and a large data set of videos.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Robustness","Educational institutions","Hardware","Software systems","Monitoring","Image resolution","Video recording","Face detection","Photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Omnidirectional-video capturing","Multiple people tracking","Subspace methods","Meeting understanding","Person-specific models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional-video capturing","Multiple people tracking","Subspace methods","Meeting understanding","Person-specific models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570757","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570757.pdf","startPage":"4150","endPage":"4155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Track Multiple People in Omnidirectional Video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Track Multiple People in Omnidirectional Video","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570757/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570757/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Track Multiple People in Omnidirectional Video","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097063S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1570789,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Berkeley, walking at the average speed of 1.3 m/s while carrying a 34 kg (75 lb) payload. Four fundamental technologies associated with the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) were tackled during the course of this project. These four core technologies include: the design of the exoskeleton architecture, control schemes, a body local area network (bLAN) to host the control algorithm and an on-board power unit to power the actuators, sensors and the computers. This article gives an overview of one of the control schemes. The analysis here is an extension of the classical definition of the sensitivity function of a system: the ability of a system to reject disturbances or the measure of system robustness. The control algorithm developed here increases the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer\u2019s forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control method has little robustness to parameter variations and therefore requires a relatively good dynamic model of the system. The tradeoffs between having sensors to measure human variables and the lack of robustness to parameter variation are described.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"4353","endPage":"4360","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570790.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Control of the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1570790/","displayDocTitle":"On the Control of the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX)","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Control of the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX)","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039345S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1570810,"authors":[{"name":"Jingdong Zhao","affiliation":["Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Jingdong Zhao","id":"37087454183"},{"name":"Zongwu Xie","affiliation":["Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Zongwu Xie","id":"37087783891"},{"name":"Li Jiang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Li Jiang","id":"37087583770"},{"name":"Hegao Cai","affiliation":["Robotics Institute of Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"lastName":"Hegao Cai","id":"37087250518"},{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"lastName":"Hong Liu","id":"37087072441"},{"name":"G.

A current limitation of robotic systems is their inability to simultaneously and independently control both joint angle and joint stiffness without electromechanical feedback loops, which can reduce system stability. In this paper, we describe the development and physical implementation of a servo-actuated robotic joint that uses antagonistic, series-elastic actuation with novel nonlinear spring mechanisms. These mechanisms form a real-time mechanical feedback loop that provides the joint with angle and stiffness control through differential and common-mode actuation of the servos, respectively. This approach to joint control emulates the mechanics of antagonistic muscle groups used by animals, and we experimentally show that it is capable of independently controlling both joint angle and joint stiffness using a simple open-loop control algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570814","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","startPage":"4508","endPage":"4513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically Inspired Joint Stiffness Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Biologically Inspired Joint Stiffness Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570814/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1570814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically Inspired Joint Stiffness Control","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054642S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1570824,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Our objective is to control the positioning of small mechanical parts with a micromanipulation system for microfactory applications. The micropositioning platform is made of three linear actuators that move points to push the object toward a goal position. At the micrometric scale, it is really difficult to model the behaviour of manipulated objects. Moreover, due to the gap between real world and discrete world perceived by the camera, the motion of parts can be seen as a little stochastic.

Direct policy search is applied to optimize the node locations and actions. The selective addition of nodes allows for progressive refinement of the control representation. We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of learning to steer cars and trucks-with-trailers around winding tracks with sharp corners. We consider the steering of both forwards and backwards-moving vehicles with only local sensory information. The steering behaviors for these nonholonomic systems are shown to generalize well to tracks not seen in training.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State-space methods","Learning","Control systems","Automatic control","Robotics and automation","Computer science","Space vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Delay","Search methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonholonomic systems","reinforcement learning","policy search","hybrid control","vehicle steering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonholonomic systems","reinforcement learning","policy search","hybrid control","vehicle steering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570827","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570827.pdf","startPage":"4588","endPage":"4593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Steer on Winding Tracks Using Semi-Parametric Control Policies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Steer on Winding Tracks Using Semi-Parametric Control Policies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570827/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570827/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Steer on Winding Tracks Using Semi-Parametric Control Policies","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051959S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570829,"authors":[{"name":"Wooram Park","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Wooram Park","id":"37308812400"},{"name":"Jin Seob Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Seob Kim","id":"38259425900"},{"name":"Yu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Zhou","id":"37288681400"},{"name":"N.J.

In the present formulation, the tissue is treated as isotropic and no obstacles are present. The bevel tip of the needle is treated as a nonholonomic constraint that can be viewed as a 3D extension of the standard kinematic cart or unicycle. A deterministic model is used as the starting point, and reachability criteria are established. A stochastic differential equation and its corresponding Fokker-Planck equation are derived. The Euler-Maruyama method is used to generate the ensemble of reachable states of the needle tip. Inverse kinematics methods developed previously for hyper-redundant and binary manipulators that use this probability density information are applied to generate needle tip paths that reach the desired targets.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570829","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10495/33250/01570829.pdf","startPage":"4600","endPage":"4605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffusion-Based Motion Planning for a Nonholonomic Flexible Needle Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1570829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 April 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1570829/","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion-Based Motion Planning for a Nonholonomic Flexible Needle Model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1570829/","conferenceDate":"18-22 April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion-Based Motion Planning for a Nonholonomic Flexible Needle Model","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"01570829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056119S","chronDate":"18-22 April 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10495","isNumber":"33250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10495","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33250","articleId":"1570829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1570832,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

While many methods for human pose estimation and tracking have been proposed, to date there has been no quantitative comparison. Our goal is to evaluate how different design choices influence tracking performance. Toward that end, we independently implemented two fairly standard Bayesian person trackers using two variants of particle filtering and propose an evaluation measure appropriate for assessing the quality of probabilistic tracking methods. In the Bayesian framework we compare various image likelihood functions and prior models of human motion that have been proposed in the literature. Our results suggest that in constrained laboratory environments, current methods perform quite well. Multiple cameras and background subtraction, however, are required to achieve reliable tracking suggesting that many current methods may be inappropriate in more natural settings.

Where necessary, visual odometry is performed on images to fine tune the position updates, particularly in high slip environments. The capability also exists for visual odometry attitude updates.

Existing test-suite reduction techniques consider test-case coverage criteria, other criteria such as risk or fault-detection effectiveness, or combinations of these criteria, but ignore the test-execution cost because of the complexity. Firstly, this paper presents a mathematical model for this test-suite reduction problem and transforms it into a linear integer-programming form. Then the paper investigates the use of an evolutionary approach, called genetic algorithm, for this test-suite reduction problem. Unlike other algorithms, our algorithm uses a new criteria, which is a combination of a block based coverage criteria and a test-execution cost criteria, to make decisions about reducing a test suite. Finally, the paper presents the results of the empirical studies of our algorithm. The studies show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the size and the cost of the test-suite for regression testing, and the test-execution cost is one of the most important features that must be taken into consideration for test-suite reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571134","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33254/01571134.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"139 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for test-suite reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for test-suite reduction","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8802852","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1571134/","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for test-suite reduction","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074005S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33254","articleId":"1571134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571191,"authors":[{"name":"Indrani Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, UP, INDIA"],"lastName":"Indrani Kar","id":"37087191649"},{"name":"P.

Many scholars used different methods to revise the model, and they have made some progress, but they didn't solve it absolutely in principle. To solve these two problem and on the angle from discrete form to discrete form, discrete grey forecasting model is constructed. And the relationship between it and original grey model is studied on, also the course of instability in original grey forecasting model is found out Finally a series of accuracy index number is used to prove the unbiased property of DGM (1,1).

The neural predictive control law is developed from the minimization of a generalized predictive performance criterion. A real time adaptive control algorithm, including a neural predictor and a neural predictive controller, is proposed; the adaptive learning rates for both the neural predictor and controller are determined based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performance for two illustrative nonlinear systems. Experimental results for a variable frequency oil-cooling control process are performed which have shown effectiveness of the proposed method under the conditions of setpoint and load changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571227/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8814558","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1571227/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and experimental evaluation of an adaptive predictive controller using recurrent neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and experimental evaluation of an adaptive predictive controller using recurrent neural network","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067836S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","xplore-issue":"33254","articleId":"1571227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571241,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Generally speaking, NNTrees can outperform standard DTs because the ENNs can extract more complex features. However, induction of multivariate DTs is very difficult. Even if each nonterminal node contains a simple oblique hyperplane, the induction problem can be NP-complete. To solve this problem, we have introduced an evolutionary algorithm that follows the same recursive procedure for inducing a standard DT, and designs an ENN for each nonterminal node using GA (genetic algorithm). This algorithm, however, is very time consuming and cannot be used easily. In this paper, we propose two new methods. One is to evolve the whole tree instead of evolving the ENNs recursively. Another is to define the group labels for the examples assigned to each nonterminal node using a heuristic method, and design the ENNs with the back propagation (BP) algorithm. Experimental results with 10 public databases show that the BP based algorithm is much more efficient than GA based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571248","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33254/01571248.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"826 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative study on GA based and BP based induction of neural network trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A comparative study on GA based and BP based induction of neural network trees","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8802952","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1571248/","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative study on GA based and BP based induction of neural network trees","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071206S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33254","articleId":"1571248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571261,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cheng","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yang Cheng","id":"37279569100"},{"name":"Mark Maimone","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Mark Maimone","id":"37332672500"},{"name":"Larry Matthies","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Larry Matthies","id":"37270488400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571261","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1583},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mars","Motion estimation","Measurement units","Wheels","Vehicle driving","Software systems","Navigation","Cameras","Tracking","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position measurement","stereo image processing","robot vision","motion estimation","planetary rovers","mobile robots","aerospace robotics","aerospace computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual odometry","Mars Exploration Rovers","onboard position estimates","inertial measurement unit","wheel encoder-based odometry","navigation cameras","stereo images","motion Estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MER","Mars Exploration Rover","Visual Odometry","Motion Estimation","Egomotion"]}],"abstract":"NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) was designed to traverse in Viking Lander-I style terrains: mostly flat, with many small non-obstacle rocks and occasional obstacles. During actual operations in such terrains, onboard position estimates derived solely from the onboard inertial measurement unit and wheel encoder-based odometry achieved well within the design goal of at most 10% error. However, MER vehicles were also driven along slippery slopes tilted as high as 31 degrees. In such conditions an additional capability was employed to maintain a sufficiently accurate onboard position estimate: visual odometry. The MER visual odometry system comprises onboard software for comparing stereo pairs taken by the pointable mast-mounted 45 degree FOV navigation cameras (NAV-CAMs). The system computes an update to the 6-DOF rover pose (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) by tracking the motion of autonomously-selected \"interesting\" terrain features between two pairs of stereo images, in both 2D pixel and 3D world coordinates. A maximum likelihood estimator is applied to the computed 3D offsets to produce a final, corrected estimate of vehicle motion between the two pairs.

Our analysis includes the effects of correlation window size, pyramidal image down-sampling, vertical misalignment, focus, maximum disparity, stereo baseline, and range ripples. A key element of validation is to determine the stereo localization error both analytically and experimentally. We study both down-range and cross-range error and verify that while camera calibration inaccuracy contributes to both, stereo correlation error affects only the former. Error contributions of subpixel interpolation, vertical misalignment, and foreshortening on stereo correlation are examined carefully. A novel method using bricks with reflective metrology targets and a mast-mounted stereo camera system enabled experimental measurements of the stereo disparity error. The standard deviation of the down-range disparity error was measured at sigma=0.32 pixel for high-resolution 1024times768 camera images.

Dependence on the pervasiveness of modern devices encompasses even simple everyday tasks. Unfortunately, the rapidly increasing expectations on the intelligence of these devices often exceeds their abilities. Devices are expected to perceive their environment, understand our intent, and autonomously carry out appropriate tasks. This paper presents an approach to bring device perception one step closer to meeting the high user expectations. A novel application of fuzzy hidden Markov models to automatically identify dynamic facial expressions is proposed in a human-device interaction context. A low-complexity vision based facial feature tracker is integrated with a hidden Markov model adapted to take advantage of fuzzy measures.

The detected face region is then divided into 20 relevant regions of interest, each of which is examined further to predict the location of the facial feature points. The proposed facial feature point detection method uses individual feature patch templates to detect points in the relevant region of interest.

In this paper, a recurrent neural network (RNN) evolved by a cooperative scheme is proposed to estimate the state of the CSTR system, which combines the architectural evolution with weight learning. In this scheme, particle swarm optimization (PSO) adoptively constructs the network architectures, then evolutionary algorithm (EA) is employed to evolve the network nodes with this architecture, and this process is automatically alternated. It can effectively alleviate the noisy fitness evaluation problem and the moving target problem. In addition of these, a closer behavioral link between the parents and their offspring is maintained, which improves the efficiency of evolving RNN. The results show that the proposed scheme is able to evolve both the architecture and weights of RNN, and the effectiveness and efficiency is better than the algorithms of TDRB, GA, PSO, and HGAPSO applied to the fully connected RNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571465","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33256/01571465.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2143 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolved recurrent neural network and its application in the state estimation of the CSTR system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An evolved recurrent neural network and its application in the state estimation of the CSTR system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8749468","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1571465/","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolved recurrent neural network and its application in the state estimation of the CSTR system","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061103S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33256","articleId":"1571465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571467,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Ping Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Ping Chen","id":"37087276127"},{"name":"Jeen-Shing Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeen-Shing Wang","id":"37087193548"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571467","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571467","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Recurrent neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","System identification","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","Computer networks","Computer simulation","Nonlinear equations","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","chaos","nonlinear dynamical systems","discrete time systems","parameter estimation","optimisation","Henon mapping","digital simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic system identification","self-constructing recurrent neural network","static nonlinear network","linear dynamic network","unified learning algorithm","hybrid weight initialization method","parameter optimization method","learning algorithm","computer simulations","discrete-time chaotic systems","logistic mappings","Henon mappings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural network","identification","chaotic system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571467","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33256/01571467.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2155 Vol. 3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of chaotic systems using a self-constructing recurrent neural network","abstract":"This paper presents a self-constructing recurrent neural network (SCRNN) capable of building itself with a compact structure from input-output measurements for identification of chaotic systems.

Furthermore, two controller structures are given. In the first controller structure, the variables in the output layers of neural networks include the continuous coding rate and the corresponding user percentage, and the continuous coding rate is quantized to be discrete value. In the second controller structure, the neural network output only include the continuous coding rate, and discrete encoding rate and the corresponding user percentage are calculated by a given formula.

Watermarking has been developed to protect digital media from being illegally reproduced and modified. Embedding and extracting watermark used to require complex procedures. In this paper, we propose a novel method called full counter-propagation neural network (FCNN) for digital image watermarking, in which the watermark is embedded and extracted through specific FCNN. Different from the traditional methods, the multiple cover images and the watermark are embedded in the synapses of a FCNN simultaneously instead of the cover images. Therefore, the watermarked image is almost the same as the original cover image. In addition, most of the attacks could not degrade the quality of the extracted watermark image. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve robustness, imperceptibility and authenticity in watermarking.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571521","startPage":"2482","endPage":"2487 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33256","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33256/01571521.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network-based robust watermarking scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571521/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural-network-based robust watermarking scheme","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1571521/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8749524","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network-based robust watermarking scheme","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056851S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33256","articleId":"1571521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571522,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Teng Lin","id":"37085971736"},{"name":"Kan-Wei Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kan-Wei Fan","id":"37087152469"},{"name":"Wen-Chang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Information Network Technology, Hsiuping institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Chang Cheng","id":"37087615344"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571522","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Histograms","Neural networks","Light sources","Power distribution","Temperature distribution","Robustness","Multilayer perceptrons","Backpropagation algorithms","Reflectivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","multilayer perceptrons","lighting","cameras","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination estimation scheme","chromaticity histogram","multilayer perceptrons","backpropagation algorithm","spectral power distribution","finite-dimensional linear model","digital camera","Max-RGB algorithm","Gray-World algorithms","trained neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color constancy","chromaticity histogram","finite-dimensional linear model","illuminant and reflectance","white point","backpropagation network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571522","abstract":"This paper proposes an algorithm for estimation the illumination of an image for the purpose of color constancy using chromaticity histogram.

We subsequently propose to use a multilayer perceptrons trained by backpropagation algorithm to model the nonlinear functional relationship between the chromaticity histogram and coefficients of illuminant functions. The trained neural network can then be used to estimate the spectral power distribution of light source. Finally, we use the trained neural network to estimate spectral power distribution in a finite-dimensional linear model of surface reflectance for color constancy.

Comparing to conventional probabilistic neural network (PNN), the so-called weighted probabilistic neural network (WPNN): 1) uses covariance matrices instead of singular smoothing factor in kernel Junction; 2) adds weighting factors in pattern to summation layer. The WPNN is able to take partial volume effect, which exists commonly in MR imaging, into account not only in the final resulting stage, but also in the modeling process. We adopt self-organizing map (SOM) neural network as the previous step of WPNN classifier, to quantize the input data. SOM yields reference vectors necessary for probabilistic density function estimation. A supervised \"soft\" labeling mechanism based on Bayesian algorithm is developed, such that weighting factors can be generated for each SOM reference vector. Tissue segmentation results from various algorithms are compared, and the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571524","startPage":"2501","endPage":"2506 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33256/01571524.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel weighted probabilistic neural network for MR image segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image segmentation","Biological neural networks","Magnetic resonance","Covariance matrix","Smoothing methods","Kernel","Density functional theory","Yield estimation","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image segmentation","brain","biological tissues","self-organising feature maps","belief networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted probabilistic neural network","brain","magnetic resonance image segmentation","covariance matrix","self-organizing map","probabilistic density function estimation","supervised soft labeling mechanism","Bayesian algorithm","tissue segmentation","partial volume effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MR image","tissue segmentation","partial volume effect","SOM neural network","WPNN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel weighted probabilistic neural network for MR image segmentation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1571524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","accessionNumber":"8749527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel weighted probabilistic neural network for MR image segmentation","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082031S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33256","articleId":"1571524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1571536,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Fang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ming Hsin University of Science and Technology, Hsin Chu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Fang Li","id":"37087179037"},{"name":"Chee-Fai Yang","lastName":"Chee-Fai Yang","id":"37087176861"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571536","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571536","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Riccati equations","Nonlinear equations","Sea measurements","Output feedback","Digital control","Control theory","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H/sup /spl infin// control","sampled data systems","nonlinear control systems","control system synthesis","reduced order systems","continuous time systems","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H/sup /spl infin// controller reduction","nonlinear sampled-data system","nonaffine nonlinear continuous-time system","dissipativity","differential game","Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities","state-space formulae"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H","Controller reduction","Sampled-data systems","Nonaffine nonlinear systems","Output feedback"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with the problems of designing reduced-order H/sup /spl infin// controllers for nonaffine nonlinear continuous-time systems with sampled measurements.

A filter bank of the models is formed and a Bayesian classifier is used to determine the correct classification of the motor condition, when tested with different types of FEM simulated data for different degrees of load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571603/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8749593","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1571603/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis of induction motors with dynamical neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis of induction motors with dynamical neural networks","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047423S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33256","articleId":"1571603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1571614,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Jun Sun","id":"37281411900"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Xu","id":"37278553000"},{"name":"Bin Feng","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Bin Feng","id":"37276527600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571614","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Information technology","Genetic programming","Genetic algorithms","Optimization methods","Equations","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive parameter control","particle swarm optimization","evolutionary search","genetic algorithm","global convergence","quantum behavior","adaptive method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","convergence","parameter control","adaptive method"]}],"abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based evolutionary search technique, which has comparable performance with genetic algorithm.

PID control schema based on classical control theory has been widely used in industrial control processes. Since most of the control systems have nonlinear properties, it is difficult to determine optimal parameters for a given PID controllers. This study utilizes the particle swarm optimization algorithm as solution method to search for PID parameters that capable of minimizing the integral absolute control error. At the same time, the transient response is guaranteed by minimizing the maximum overshoot, settling time, rising time of step response. Moreover, we also utilize \u03b5-constraint method to improve the performance of the controllers.

The only training information provided to the controller are transition experiences collected from interactions with the real plant. By storing these transition experiences explicitly, they can be reconsidered for updating the neural Q-function in every training step. This results in a stable learning process of a neural Q-value function. The algorithm is applied to learn the highly nonlinear and noisy task of swinging-up and balancing a real inverted pendulum. The amount of real time interaction needed to learn a highly effective policy from scratch was less than 14 minutes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Multilayer perceptrons","Neural networks","Stochastic systems","Multi-layer neural network","State-space methods","Acceleration","Regression tree analysis","Stress","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear control systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural reinforcement learning","neural network","reinforcement learning controller","control policy","learning process","neural Q-value function","inverted pendulum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571637","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33257/01571637.pdf","startPage":"3191","endPage":"3196 Vol. 4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural reinforcement learning to swing-up and balance a real pole","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural reinforcement learning to swing-up and balance a real pole","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571637/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1571637/","accessionNumber":"8802994","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural reinforcement learning to swing-up and balance a real pole","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059266S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33257","articleId":"1571637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1571652,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This system is composed of a robot that has two microphones with reflectors corresponding to human's pinnas. To acquire the horizontal direction, the interaural time difference is used as the auditory cue. To acquire the vertical direction, the features on the audio spectrum induced by the reflectors are used as the auditory cue.

This problem is called active learning. Most of the existing active learning methods did not directly relate to the generalization error of classifiers. Also, some of them need high computational time or are based on strict assumptions. This paper describes a new active learning strategy using the concept of localized generalization error of the candidate samples. The sample which yields the largest generalization error will be chosen for query. This method can be applied to different kinds of classifiers and its complexity is low. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the classifier can be improved by using this selecting method and fewer training samples are possible for the same prediction accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Accuracy","Stochastic processes","Sensitivity analysis","Neural networks","Text categorization","Image retrieval","Drugs","Cancer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active learning","localized generalization error","classification problem","learning process","classifier knowledge","query processing","RBF neural network","stochastic sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Learning","Localized Generalization Error","RBF neural network","Stochastic Sensitivity Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571707","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10498/33257/01571707.pdf","startPage":"3604","endPage":"3609 Vol. 4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active learning using localized generalization error of candidate sample as criterion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active learning using localized generalization error of candidate sample as criterion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571707/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1571707/","accessionNumber":"8814601","conferenceDate":"12-12 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning using localized generalization error of candidate sample as criterion","confLoc":"Waikoloa, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01571707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044364S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10498","isNumber":"33257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10498","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33257","articleId":"1571707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1571748,"authors":[{"name":"Dah-Jing Jwo","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Dah-Jing Jwo","id":"37087264894"},{"name":"Hung-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Guidance Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Chih Huang","id":"37087397627"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9298-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1062-922X"}],"articleNumber":"1571748","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571748","abstract":"GPS navigation state processing using the extended Kalman filter provides optimal solutions (in the mean square sense) if the noise statistics for the measurement and system are completely known.

The sooner EMC rules are taken into account in the design phase, the sooner the target product can be released on the market, lowering engineering costs at the same time. However, with ever increasing complexity in integrated circuits (ICs), and thus ever higher emission and susceptibility levels, it can be seen that reducing these levels in the IC themselves then makes it much easier to ensure system-level EMC compliance. This paper proposes a VHDL-AMS based methodology aimed at modelling and predicting conducted emission levels of ICs within the design How. This approach, using the ICEM (integrated circuit electromagnetic model) proposal, allows the designer to build reusable, fast to simulate, behavioral dynamic activity models that can be combined in order to evaluate the whole activity of a complex IC, including inputs and outputs as well as highly integrated blocks like memories. The influence of the internal power distribution can also be studied before IC layout. Comparisons between simulations and measurements have been performed on a real-world microcontroller (from ATMEL) and demonstrate the validity of this approach in an industrial context, leading to the development of intellectual-property (IP) activity models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33258","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33258/01571806.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571806","startPage":"193","endPage":"198 vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMC evaluation in integrated circuits using VHDL-AMS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571806/","displayDocTitle":"EMC evaluation in integrated circuits using VHDL-AMS","htmlLink":"/document/1571806/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"8892951","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMC evaluation in integrated circuits using VHDL-AMS","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01571806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03877S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33258","articleId":"1571806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1571809,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The inverse model of this system is unrealizable. The control structure consists of a feedforward ANN that approximates the inverse of the model, an ANN feedback control law, a reference model and the adaptation process of the ANNs with variable learning rate. In this structure, the learning rate of the feedback ANN is sensitive to load inertia variations. The contribution of this paper is to resolve this weakness by proposing a supervisor that adapts the neural networks learning rate. Simulation results highlight the performance of the controller to compensate the nonlinear friction terms, in particular Coulomb friction, and flexibility, and its robustness to the load and drive motor inertia parameter changes. Internal stability, a potential problem with such a system, is also verified.","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33258/01571819.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"276 vol. 1","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control structure for a flexible joint with hard nonlinearities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control structure for a flexible joint with hard nonlinearities","htmlLink":"/document/1571819/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8901393","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based model reference adaptive control structure for a flexible joint with hard nonlinearities","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01571819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042733S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33258","articleId":"1571819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1571833,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Some of these parameters, such as stator resistance are given by constructors, but they vary in different operating conditions. The purpose of this paper is to present an efficient dynamical identification method to estimate parameters of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). Using this method, we can determine these parameters during different operating conditions. This method has been simulated and implemented in an experimental test bench using a dSpace board and obtained results proved the validity and efficiency of proposed method. Physical parameters estimation of a dynamical 3-parameter model thanks to dynamical measurements is performed using an output error algorithm based on non linear optimisation. Simulations results show that, if PMSM is fed by a PWM inverter, no extra-signal, such as a pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) adding on speed reference in vector control of PMSM, is necessary to excite the machine to assure identification algorithm convergence. However an extra-signal is a disturbance in respect to the machine running.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571836","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33258/01571836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33258","startPage":"371","endPage":"376 vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameters estimation of permanent magnet synchronous machine without adding extra-signal as input excitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1571836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameters estimation of permanent magnet synchronous machine without adding extra-signal as input excitation","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571836/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2004","accessionNumber":"8901399","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1571836/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameters estimation of permanent magnet synchronous machine without adding extra-signal as input excitation","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01571836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050674S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"33258","articleId":"1571836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":1571838,"authors":[{"name":"M.

After a presentation of the existing fault model, a new detailed approach is proposed. It is based on two effects of a bearing fault: the introduction of a particular radial rotor movement and load torque variations caused by the bearing fault. The theoretical study results in new expressions for the stator current frequency content. Experimental tests with artificial and realistic bearing damage were conducted by measuring vibration, torque and stator current.

Among the various kinds of EV prototypes presented by the car manufacturers, fuel cell powered electrical vehicles seem to be a very promising solution. When talking about EV design, a simulation model of the whole fuel cell system is a binding milestone. This would lead in the optimization possibility of the complete vehicle (including all ancillaries, output electrical converter and their dedicated control laws). Nevertheless, the fuel cell system model is strongly dependent of many physico-chemical parameters that are difficult to evaluate on a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack. Moreover, the analytical relations governing the behavior of a PEMFC system are also far from being easy. Thus, a \"minimal behavioral model\" of a fuel cell system, able to evaluate the output variables and their variations, is highly interesting. Artificial neural networks propose a very efficient tool to reach such an aim. A dynamic recurrent neural network model of a fuel cell system based on proton exchange membrane technology is presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571853","startPage":"471","endPage":"476 vol. 1","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33258","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33258/01571853.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical recurrent neural network towards modeling of on-board fuel cell power supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571853/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamical recurrent neural network towards modeling of on-board fuel cell power supply","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1571853/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8892982","publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical recurrent neural network towards modeling of on-board fuel cell power supply","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01571853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055736S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33258","articleId":"1571853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1571855,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The algorithms developed here are potentially useful for the design of the drives that can adjust controller parameters automatically. Another possible application is for the detection of failure. In the first scheme, leakage coefficient and rotor time-constant are estimated using the measured rotor speed, stator current and voltage. In the second scheme, rotor resistance is estimated when the rotor speed is available while in the third scheme, both rotor resistance and rotor speed are identified. All the parameters are considered to be time-varying and short-circuit failure is simulated in the rotor resistance. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of this technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571855","startPage":"483","endPage":"489 vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33258/01571855.pdf","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of electrical parameters and rotor speed of induction motor using radial basis neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Induction motors","Neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Automatic control","Current measurement","Electrical resistance measurement","Velocity measurement","Stators","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function networks","rotors","induction motor drives","stators","electric machine analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical parameters","rotor speed measurement","induction motor","high-gain observer","radial basis function neuronal predictor","controller parameter adjustment","rotor time-constant","stator current","time-varying parameters","short-circuit failure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-varying Parameter","High-gain Observer","Radial Basis Function","Induction Motor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1571855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","displayDocTitle":"Identification of electrical parameters and rotor speed of induction motor using radial basis neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1571855/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","accessionNumber":"8901407","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of electrical parameters and rotor speed of induction motor using radial basis neural network","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01571855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073123S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33258","articleId":"1571855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1571867,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The control of the converter is implemented in Simulink and dSpace and uses a PI feedback loop. The active load is designed for characterization of a fuel cell system, and therefore an electric circuit model for fuel cells is introduced. The circuit model contains a highly non-linear voltage source describing the activation polarization and the concentration polarization, two resistors for the ohmic polarization and the membranes double layer capacitor for the dynamic behaviour. The circuit model parameters are obtained from the measured data.

The obtained modeling shows that high voltage multilevels are obtained by combination of four different three-level functions, which are called conversion functions. Therefore a novel PWM strategy is designed by a particular modulation for creating four fictive modulated voltage systems via the direct width modulation and the position setting of both conversion functions. Redundancies of different switch configurations for the generation of intermediate voltages are used to limit the deviations of capacitor voltages. A correct filtered AC output is obtained with a classical closed loop control.

This paper begins by presenting a device thermal model suitable for a MOSFET power-switch derived from the seven-layer physical structure of the device. However it is shown subsequently that a third-order thermal model can give satisfactory estimates of device temperature. Furthermore, computational efficiency can he improved if the model is implemented as a third-order difference equation.

As confirmed by the experimental results, the proposed approach exhibits interesting potentialities.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2004.1572025","startPage":"1435","endPage":"1439 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/10499/33259/01572025.pdf","publicationTitle":"2004 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2004.1572025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line multi-objective optimization of controllers for electric drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic control","Hardware","Genetic algorithms","Three-term control","Testing","Control design","Drives","Algorithm design and analysis","Current measurement","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","machine control","power engineering computing","control engineering computing","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","online multiobjective optimization","discrete-time linear controllers","design procedure","automatic approach","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control","Dc-Drive","Genetic Algorithms","Online optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1572025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 2004","displayDocTitle":"On-line multi-objective optimization of controllers for electric drives","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1572025/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 2004","accessionNumber":"8748406","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line multi-objective optimization of controllers for electric drives","confLoc":"Ajaccio, France","sourcePdf":"01572025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08127S","chronDate":"4-7 May 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10499","isNumber":"33259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10499","xplore-issue":"33259","articleId":"1572025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1572026,"authors":[{"name":"W.G. da Silva","affiliation":["Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, Ituiutaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil"],"firstName":"W.G.","lastName":"da Silva","id":"37444877400"},{"name":"P.P.

Users consume these services based on their QoS (quality of service) requirements. In such \"pay-per-use\" grids, workflow execution cost must be considered during scheduling based on users' QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose a cost-based workflow scheduling algorithm that minimizes execution cost while meeting the deadline for delivering results. It can also adapt to the delays of service executions by rescheduling unexecuted tasks. We also attempt to optimally solve the task scheduling problem in branches with several sequential tasks by modeling the branch as a Markov decision process and using the value iteration method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-1 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1572219/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9026105","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1572219/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cost-based scheduling of scientific workflow applications on utility grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-based scheduling of scientific workflow applications on utility grids","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"01572219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106344S","chronDate":"1-1 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10501","isNumber":"33262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10501","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"33262","articleId":"1572219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1572267,"authors":[{"name":"H.

As demonstrated by the Y2K problem, computer professionals used a wrong time scale when thinking about software. Large software products live much longer than expected. It took a few decades to the research community to admit that software engineering was not only about software development, but above all, about software evolution. However, most academics still consider languages as immutable artefacts. Language/software co-evolution issues are still neglected. Migration issues are however commonplace in software industry. It is therefore time to recognize that languages evolve too. Languages are integral parts of software products. Languages are software too. This paper surveys a few models of evolution taking decades and centuries as time-scales. Then programming languages evolution over the last half-century is sketched by means of a metamodel movie.","doi":"10.1109/IWPSE.2005.22","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Principles of Software Evolution (IWPSE'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Principles of Software Evolution (IWPSE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10503/33264/01572304.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWPSE.2005.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Languages evolve too!

In this paper, we propose using the concept of responsibility to define model mapping where responsibility represents a high-level description of \"tasks to be accomplished by something\".

The three world levels represent different levels of abstraction within the software system. The two views separate the structural concepts and behavioral concepts of each world level. RESTDA applies a two-phase generation. The first phase generates an intermediate model from high-level models. The second phase generates code from the intermediate model. The automatic transformation promises that any change to the business requirements results in corresponding code generation. The intermediate model separates changes to the underlying implementation technology from the top-most level.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software systems","Programming","Computer architecture","Unified modeling language","Information science","Buildings","Information systems","Business communication","Writing","Software maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software architecture","software prototyping","information systems","program compilers","formal verification","formal specification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven development approach","human-centered software evolution","RESTDA","enterprise information systems","business requirements","code generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IWPSE.2005.28","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Principles of Software Evolution (IWPSE'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Workshop on Principles of Software Evolution (IWPSE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10503/33264/01572311.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWPSE.2005.28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steering model-driven evolution by responsibilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1572311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Steering model-driven evolution by responsibilities","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1572311/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1572311/","accessionNumber":"8704844","conferenceDate":"5-6 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 Sept. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steering model-driven evolution by responsibilities","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01572311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052812S","chronDate":"5-6 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10503","isNumber":"33264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10503","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33264","articleId":"1572311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1572536,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We present an approach to autonomous humanoid walking that combines vision-based sensing with a footstep planner, allowing the robot to navigate toward a desired goal position while avoiding obstacles. An environment map including the robot, goal, and obstacle locations is built in real-time from vision. The footstep planner then computes an optimal sequence of footstep locations within a time-limited planning horizon. Footstep plans are reused and only partially recomputed as the environment changes during the walking sequence. In our experiments, combining real-time vision with plan reuse has allowed a Honda ASIMO humanoid robot to autonomously traverse dynamic environments containing unpredictably moving obstacles","doi":"10.1109/ICHR.2005.1573538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHR.2005.1573538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33272","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10507/33272/01573538.pdf","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2005.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Humanoid robots","Robot kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Navigation","Robot vision systems","Parallel robots","Humans","Computer vision","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","humanoid robots","legged locomotion","robot dynamics","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-guided humanoid footstep planning","dynamic environments","stable walking capabilities","biped humanoid robots","vision-based sensing","obstacle avoidance","time-limited planning horizon","Honda ASIMO humanoid robot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vision-guided humanoid footstep planning for dynamic environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9072014","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1573538/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573538/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-guided humanoid footstep planning for dynamic environments","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"01573538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061577S","chronDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10507","isNumber":"33272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10507","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"33272","articleId":"1573538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1573544,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Full-fledged robotic imitation learning comprises many difficult subtasks. However, we argue that, at its core, imitation learning reduces to a regression problem. We propose a two-step framework in which an imitating agent first performs a regression from a high-dimensional observation space to a low-dimensional latent variable space. In the second step, the agent performs a regression from the latent variable space to a high-dimensional space representing degrees of freedom of its motor system. We demonstrate the validity of the approach by learning to map motion capture data from human actors to a humanoid robot. We also contrast use of several low-dimensional latent variable spaces, each covering a subset of agents' degrees of freedom, with use of a single, higher-dimensional latent variable space. Our findings suggest that compositing several regression models together yields qualitatively better imitation results than using a single, more complex regression model","doi":"10.1109/ICHR.2005.1573557","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10507/33272/01573557.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHR.2005.1573557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robotic imitation from human motion capture using Gaussian processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Robotic imitation from human motion capture using Gaussian processes","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1573557/","accessionNumber":"9045423","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robotic imitation from human motion capture using Gaussian processes","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"01573557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0432S","chronDate":"5-5 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10507","isNumber":"33272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10507","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"33272","articleId":"1573557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1573562,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A variety of humanlike robot hands have been constructed, but it remains difficult to control these hands in a dexterous way. One challenge is grasp synthesis, where we wish to place the hand and control its shape to successfully grasp a given object. In this paper, we present a datadriven approach to grasp synthesis that treats grasping as a shape matching problem. We begin with a database of grasp examples. Given a model of a new object to be grasped (the query), shape features of the object are compared to shape features of hand poses in these examples in order to identify candidate grasps. For effective retrieval, we develop a novel shape matching algorithm that can accommodate the sparse shape information associated with hand pose and that considers relative placements of contact points and normals, which are important for grasp function.

The effect of multielement contamination (alkali, transition, and noble metals up to 200 ppb levels) in dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), standard clean one (SC1), and standard clean two (SC2) solutions is investigated for an Intel Pentium-based sub-100-nm microprocessor technology. The main significance of this work is to achieve a rational specification for process chemical purity. Results from surface analyses of monitor wafers and device level electrical measurements of production scale wafers along with yield and reliability analyses are presented in this paper. Deposition of metallic contaminants from clean solutions has been explained qualitatively based on electrochemical theory of reduction potentials. Among the 35 elements investigated in this study, only platinum at very low parts-per-billion levels in the HF-based cleans has been found to affect the gate oxide integrity producing zero yield. An increase in the surface roughness (2-8/spl times/) was also observed with silicon monitor wafers for 100-ppb-platinum-contaminated DHF solutions and could play an important role in degrading the gate oxide performance. Other alkali and transition metals including copper up to 200 ppb levels in the HF-based cleans studied here did not show any deleterious effects in the gate oxide integrity and product reliability measurements. The effect of contamination in the SC1 and SC2 cleans was negligible even for 100 ppb platinum. Significant cost reduction can be realized by safely relaxing the process chemical contamination disposition limits for alkali and transition elements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/33275/01573678.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2005.861161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2005.861161","startPage":"631","endPage":"638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of metal contaminants in pre-gate oxide cleans for sub-100-nm devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573678/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of metal contaminants in pre-gate oxide cleans for sub-100-nm devices","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1573678/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"8850447","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of metal contaminants in pre-gate oxide cleans for sub-100-nm devices","sourcePdf":"01573678.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041729S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"33275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33275","articleId":"1573678","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1573687,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

The prototype material is a copolymer consisting of 70% vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and 30% trifluoroethylene (TrFE), or P(VDF-TrFE 70:30). Recent work with LB films and more conventional solvent-formed films shows that the VDF copolymers are promising materials for nonvolatile memory applications. The prototype device is the metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) capacitance memory. Field-effect transistor (FET)-based devices are also discussed. The LB films afford devices with low-voltage operation, but there are two important technical hurdles that must be surmounted. First, an appropriate method must be found to control switching dynamics in the LB copolymer films. Second, the LB technology must be scaled up and incorporated into the semiconductor-manufacturing process, but since there is no precedent for mass production of LB films, it is difficult to project how long this will take.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2005.860818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/33275/01573690.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2005.860818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films for nonvolatile memory applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573690/","displayDocTitle":"Ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films for nonvolatile memory applications","volume":"5","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1573690/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8850459","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films for nonvolatile memory applications","sourcePdf":"01573690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152867S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"33275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"33275","articleId":"1573690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1573701,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Shitong","affiliation":["Computer Department, Southern Yangtse University, Wuxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/33276/1573701/1573701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wang Shitong received the M.S. degree in computer science from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, in 1987.","He visited London University and Bristol University in U.K., Hiroshima International University in Japan, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Hong Kong City University in Hong Kong, as a Research Scientist, for over four years.

Its accuracy and stability greatly affect the operating speed and recognition accuracy of the whole system. But there are only a few methods available for cell detection or segmentation due to the complexity of the microscopic images. This paper focuses on this issue. Based on the detailed analysis of the existing two methods-threshold segmentation followed by mathematical morphology (TSMM), and the fuzzy logic method-a new detection algorithm (NDA) based on fuzzy cellular neural networks is proposed. NDA combines the advantages of TSMM and the fuzzy logic method, and overcomes their drawbacks. With NDA, we can detect almost all white blood cells, and the contour of each detected cell is nearly complete. Its adaptability is strong and the running speed is expected to be comparatively high due to the easy hardware implementation of FCN.

Indeed, in this paper we report the meta-analysis of the efficacy of virtual reality simulators in: 1) the transference of skills from the simulator training environment to the operating room, and 2) their ability to discriminate between the experience levels of their users. The task completion time and the error score were the two study outcomes collated and analyzed in this meta-analysis. Sixteen studies were identified from a computer-based literature search (1996-2004). The meta-analysis of the random effects model (because of the heterogeneity of the data) revealed that training on virtual reality simulators did lessen the time taken to complete a given surgical task as well as clearly differentiate between the experienced and the novice trainees. Meta-analytic studies such as the one reported here would be very helpful in the planning and setting up of surgical training programs and for the establishment of reference `learning curves' for a specific simulator and surgical task.

This paper presents the implementation of a real-time classification system for the types of human movement associated with the data acquired from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit. The major advance proposed by the system is to perform the vast majority of signal processing onboard the wearable unit using embedded intelligence. In this way, the system distinguishes between periods of activity and rest, recognizes the postural orientation of the wearer, detects events such as walking and falls, and provides an estimation of metabolic energy expenditure. A laboratory-based trial involving six subjects was undertaken, with results indicating an overall accuracy of 90.8% across a series of 12 tasks (283 tests) involving a variety of movements related to normal daily activities. Distinction between activity and rest was performed without error; recognition of postural orientation was carried out with 94.1% accuracy, classification of walking was achieved with less certainty (83.3% accuracy), and detection of possible falls was made with 95.6% accuracy.

The currents induced on the arrays are presented for the first time and their study reveals two distinct resonance phenomena associated with these surfaces. A new technique is presented to tailor the spectral position of the AMC operation and the EBG. Square patch arrays with fixed element size and variable periodicities are employed as working examples to demonstrate the dependence of the spectral AMC and EBG characteristics on array parameters. It is revealed that as the array periodicity is increased, the AMC frequency is increased, while the EBG frequency is reduced. This is shown to occur due to the different nature of the resonance phenomena and the associated underlying physical mechanisms that produce the two effects. The effect of substrate thickness is also investigated. Full wave method of moments (MoM) has been employed for the derivation of the reflection characteristics, the currents and the dispersion relations. A uniplanar array with simultaneous AMC and EBG operation is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/33278/01573743.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.861575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.861575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tailoring the AMC and EBG characteristics of periodic metallic arrays printed on grounded dielectric substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric substrates","Periodic structures","Metamaterials","Surface waves","Frequency selective surfaces","Conductors","Magnetosphere","Magnetic resonance","Wireless communication","Surface impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic band gap","dielectric bodies","method of moments","planar antenna arrays","microstrip antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial magnetic conductor","AMC","electromagnetic band gap characteristics","EBG","planar periodic metallic array","grounded dielectric substrate","resonance phenomena","square patch array","physical mechanism","full wave method of moment","MoM","reflection characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial magnetic conductor (AMC)","electromagnetic band gap (EBG)","frequency selective surface (FSS)","metamaterials"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Tailoring the AMC and EBG characteristics of periodic metallic arrays printed on grounded dielectric substrate","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1573743/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8840239","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tailoring the AMC and EBG characteristics of periodic metallic arrays printed on grounded dielectric substrate","sourcePdf":"01573743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049037S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"33278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"33278","articleId":"1573743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1573744,"authors":[{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/33278/1573744/1573744-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Long Li was born in Anshun, Guizhou, China, in January 1977.

The LRCC model proposes two kinds of main resonance modes: One is the mono-polarized mode that accurately predicts the position of the surface wave suppression bandgap, which is equivalent to the LC parallel resonance based on quasistatic assumption in principle, and the other is the cross-coupling polarized mode that exhibits some interesting resonant phenomena, which has not been observed previously. Parametric studies including the radius effect of the metal plated vias are effectively performed by using the LRCC model.

Robust detection of targets within sea clutter may strengthen coastal security, improve navigation safety, and help environmental monitoring. However, no simple and reliable methods for detecting targets within sea clutter have been proposed. We introduce the structure function based multifractal theory to analyze 392 sea clutter datasets measured under various sea and weather conditions. It is found that sea clutter data exhibit multifractal behaviors in the time scale range of about 0.01 s to a few seconds, especially for data with targets. The fractal and multifractal features of sea clutter enable us to develop a simple and effective method to detect targets within sea clutter. It is shown that the method achieves very high detection accuracy. It is further shown that in the time scale range of 0.01 s to a few seconds, sea clutter data is weakly nonstationary. The nonstationarity may explain why modeling using distributions such as Weibull, log-normal, K, and compound-Gaussian only offers limited understanding of the physics of sea clutter and is not very effective in detecting targets within sea clutter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/33278/01573749.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.861541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.861541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of low observable targets within sea clutter by structure function based multifractal analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fractals","Radar detection","Sea measurements","Sea surface","Radar clutter","Robustness","Data security","Navigation","Safety","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar clutter","radar detection","backscatter","fractals","electromagnetic pulse","target tracking","structure functions","marine radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low observable target detection","sea clutter","structure function","multifractal analysis","backscattering","radar pulse","coastal security","navigation safety","environmental monitoring","weather condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractal","radar","sea clutter","structure function based multifractal analysis","target detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Detection of low observable targets within sea clutter by structure function based multifractal analysis","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1573749/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8840245","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of low observable targets within sea clutter by structure function based multifractal analysis","sourcePdf":"01573749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092647S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"33278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"33278","articleId":"1573749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":1573752,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This method applies the technique directly to the data without forming a covariance matrix. Simulation results show that the variance of the estimate approaches to the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Using real computations through the unitary transformation for the MP method leads to a very efficient computational methodology for real time implementation on a digital signal processor chip. A unitary transform can convert the complex matrix to a real matrix along with their eigenvectors and thereby reducing the computational cost at least by a factor of four without sacrificing accuracy. This reduction in the number of computations is achieved by using a transformation, which maps centro-hermitian matrices to real matrices.

This structure is circularly and radially periodic, and it is excited at its center using an omnidirectional source. The analysis is based on calculating the transmission and reflection coefficients of a single cylindrical frequency selective surface (FSS) and then, considering only the fundamental mode interaction, deducing the frequency response of the CEBG structure composed of multiple cylindrical FSSs. For this structure, new analytical formulas are derived, and their accuracy is assessed compared to those obtained by the finite-difference time-domain method. As in rectangularly periodic structure case, the frequency response of the CEBG structure exhibits pass-bands and bandgaps, and it is possible to obtain directive beams by introducing defects in the periodic structure. Using this concept, a new antenna was developed to obtain a controllable directive beam. An antenna prototype, without control, was designed, fabricated, and tested. An excellent agreement was obtained between theory and experiment for both return loss and radiation patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2005.861560","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/33278/01573758.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2005.861560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"211","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a cylindrical EBG-based directive antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a cylindrical EBG-based directive antenna","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573758/","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1573758/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8840254","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a cylindrical EBG-based directive antenna","sourcePdf":"01573758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095618S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"33278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"33278","articleId":"1573758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1573760,"authors":[{"name":"Hoi Kuen Ng","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Centre and Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/33278/1573760/1573760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hoi Kuen Ng (S'01\u2013M'05) was born in Hong Kong on April 10, 1975.

The broadside couplers and 180/spl deg/ hybrid for the modulators in the CMOS process are broad-band designs with low phase/amplitude errors. The dc offset and imbalance for the proposed topology are investigated and compared with the conventional reflection-type modulators. The measured dc offset was improved by more than 10 dB. Both BPSK and IQ modulators feature a conversion loss of 13 dB, a modulation bandwidth of wider than 1 GHz, and second- and third-order spur suppressions of better than -30 dBc. The IQ modulator shows good sideband suppression with high local-oscillator suppression from 20 to 40 GHz.

A patch antenna tested the performance of the magnetic metamaterial as a substrate and validated that a single substrate can achieve a range of miniaturization values. The effective medium metamaterial substrate employed electromagnetically small embedded circuits (ECs) to achieve permeability and permittivity greater than that of the host dielectric. Geometric control of the ECs allowed mu and epsi to be tailored to the application. The magnetic metamaterial exhibited enhanced mu and epsi with acceptable loss-factor levels. Models for predicting mu and epsi are presented, the benefits of employing metamaterial substrates are discussed, and the results in this antenna experiment are presented. The metamaterial exhibits performance characteristics not achievable from natural materials. Of particular significance is that with the permeability varying strongly and predictably with frequency, the miniaturization factor may be selected by tuning the operating frequency. Simulations indicate that such performance can be extended to several gigahertz with current technology.

A novel RC coupling circuit along with a high driving current, provided by a high-speed amplifier and buffers, are used to obtain an increase in the output power. A decoupling circuit is implemented to reduce ringing on the monocycle pulse and provide necessary pulse clamping. Tuning of the output monocycle-pulse duration is achieved by using two distributed delay lines, coupled together by the decoupling network, each spatially loaded with antiparallel p-i-n diodes that are alternately switched on and off.

Using this idea, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is trained to approximate the space-domain multilayered media boxed Green's functions used in the integral-equation (IE) method. Once the RBFNN has been trained, the outputs of the neural network (NN) replace the exact Green's functions, during the numerical solution of the IE. The computation of the RBFNN output values is very fast in comparison with the numerical methods used to calculate the exact Green's functions. This paper describes two novel strategies for efficiently training the RBFNN. In the first strategy, the input space of the RBFNN is divided into several spatial and frequency regions. The spatial subdivision is extended for the first time to both observation and source regions. In addition, the subdivision of the observation points regions is applied in a novel manner to the whole cross section of the metallic box. The second strategy combines the above region subdivision with an adaptive selection of the neurons variances in each region.

The empirical method generates the tones in a coherent form and supports the evaluation of effects dependent on baseband impedance and tone separation. A high electron-mobility transistor amplifier under two-tone excitation has been widely characterized using the experimental setup, and measurements have been compared with simulated data showing a good agreement.

Moreover, the hybrid algorithm can be used for the parameter extraction of arbitrary complex circuits and structures, such as substrate integrated circuits (SICs). The SICs that are studied in this work are based on substrate integrated waveguides, which are useful for the design of millimeter-wave planar circuits such as filters, resonators, and antennas.

Two PAs were investigated: one was designed for the third-generation (3G) mobile telecommunication systems and one was designed for the second-generation (2G). The RBFNN reduced the total model error slightly more than the PH, but the error out of band was significantly lower for the PH. The Volterra was found to give a lower model error than did a PH of the same nonlinear order and memory depth. The PH could give a lower model error than the best Volterra, since the former could be identified with a higher nonlinear order and memory depth. The qualitative conclusions are the same for the 2G and 3G PAs, but the model errors are smaller for the latter. For the 3G PA, a static polynomial gave a low model error as low as the best PH and lower than the RBFNN for the hardest cross validation.

To suppress spurious solutions, mixed-order curl conforming vector basis functions are used in the SEM. The advantages of this method include its high-order accuracy and its diagonal mass matrix due to the use of orthogonal Legendre polynomials. Thus, the proposed method leads to a regular eigenvalue problem rather than a generalized eigenvalue problem, greatly reducing the computer memory requirement and CPU time in comparison with the conventional high-order finite-element method (FEM). Numerical examples of eigenvalue problems verify the spectral accuracy with the interpolation orders and show that the SEM is superior to the FEM for the class of problems considered. A waveguide model is analyzed with mixed boundary conditions and its results are in excellent agreement with reference values.

With the slot-coupled directional coupler, the proposed matrix was designed without using any crossovers as used in conventional Butler matrices, which leads to significant size reduction and loss minimization. To examine the performance of the proposed matrix, experimental prototypes of the multilayer directional coupler and the Butler matrix were fabricated and measured. Furthermore, a four-antenna array was also designed and fabricated at 5.8 GHz and then connected to the matrix to form a beamforming antenna system. As a result, four orthogonal beams at -45deg, -15deg, 15deg, and 45deg are produced. Measured results on the entire system agree well with the theoretical predictions, validating the proposed design","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.860490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/33279/01573849.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.860490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel butler matrix using CPW multilayer technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573849/","displayDocTitle":"Novel butler matrix using CPW multilayer technology","volume":"54","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8962022","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1573849/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel butler matrix using CPW multilayer technology","sourcePdf":"01573849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093544S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"33279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"33279","articleId":"1573849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1573862,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.M.

The uncoded bit or symbol error rate (SER) is specified as a channel quality metric in second and third generation cellular systems (e.g., general packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS), and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). Nonetheless, techniques to estimate the uncoded SER are typically outside the scope of these wireless standards and are not specified. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a number of uncoded SER estimation techniques, including a novel technique in which we use the soft information of the received symbols to obtain a fast and accurate estimate of the uncoded SER. The technique we introduce has been found to outperform, in terms of accuracy and required estimation interval, conventional hard-decision based techniques that use test-patterns, or use a decode/re-encode/compare approach . Our technique also outperforms the brute-force technique, which is to send a known test-pattern, demodulate it at the receiver, and count the observed discrepancies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Estimation error","Packet radio networks","Testing","Wireless communication","Quality of service","Resource management","Ground penetrating radar","3G mobile communication","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel estimation","quality of service","wireless channels","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncoded symbol error rate estimation","wireless communications systems","channel quality estimation","quality of service","resource allocation techniques","third generation cellular systems","second generation cellular systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER) estimation","channel quality estimation","channel quality metrics","3GPP","maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding","mobile assisted handoff (MAHO)","power-control","symbol error rate estimation (SER)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573862","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2005.853446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/33280/01573862.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.853446","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncoded symbol error rate estimation: methods and analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uncoded symbol error rate estimation: methods and analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573862/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1573862/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8808797","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncoded symbol error rate estimation: methods and analysis","sourcePdf":"01573862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097479S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1573864,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yunxia Chen (S'04) received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 1998 and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2004.

Although the fiber has adequate bandwidth, nonlinear distortion due to electrical to optical (E/O) conversion is a concern. In the uplink, the dynamic multipath wireless channel is followed by this static memoryless ROF link; this forms a Wiener system. In this paper, we propose a Hammerstein type decision feedback equalizer (HDFE) for the fiber-wireless uplink to combat the nonlinear distortion and the wireless channel dispersion. The proposed equalizer is less complex because it handles static and dynamic distortions separately. The nonlinear distortion is compensated first, reducing the power of cross modulation products significantly. Analytical results show that the lower bound of the mean squared error depends on the optical and wireless channel noise. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the HDFE for the nonlinear channel approaches the performance of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in a linear channel when the nonlinearity is adequately compensated.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2005.858170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/33280/01573865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.858170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33280","startPage":"1980","endPage":"1991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hammerstein-type equalizer for concatenated fiber-wireless uplink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hammerstein-type equalizer for concatenated fiber-wireless uplink","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8808800","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1573865/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hammerstein-type equalizer for concatenated fiber-wireless uplink","sourcePdf":"01573865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080515S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1573867,"authors":[{"name":"Honglei Miao","affiliation":["Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/33280/1573867/1573867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Honglei Miao (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in June 1996 and the M.S. degree from the China Academy of Telecommunication Technology (CATT), Beijing, China, in March 1999.

A two-step channel estimation algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the iterative quadrature maximum likelihood based time delay and spatial signature estimation is presented by utilizing special training signals with a cyclic structure. The receive spatial correlation matrix of the vector valued channel impulse response is formulated as a function of the spatial signature, the time delay, and the pulse shaping filter. The joint spatio-temporal (JST) filtering based minimum mean squared error channel estimator is derived by virtue of the spatial correlation. In addition, the effect of channel estimation errors on the bit error probability performance of the space-time block coded OFDM system over correlated MIMO channels is derived. The Cramer-Rao lower bound on the time delay estimate is provided for a benchmark of the performance comparison. The performance of proposed algorithms is illustrated based on analysis and computer simulations. The JST channel estimator achieves significant gains in the mean squared error compared to the temporal filtering. It also enables remarkable savings in the pilot symbol power level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time channel estimation and performance analysis for wireless MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2005.858179","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/33280/01573867.pdf","startPage":"2003","endPage":"2016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.858179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33280","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Space-time channel estimation and performance analysis for wireless MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1573867/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8808802","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time channel estimation and performance analysis for wireless MIMO-OFDM systems with spatial correlation","sourcePdf":"01573867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223981S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1573872,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/33280/1573872/1573872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Xiao (S'03) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Teaching Reform Class (TRC), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2002 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2004.

The complex channel estimate and the actual fading are modeled as jointly Gaussian random variables. For SC systems with channel estimation error, closed-form expressions are obtained for the error rates of M/sub s/-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rectangular-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and simple single integral formulas with finite integration limits are derived for the symbol error probability of arbitrary two-dimensional (2-D) modulation formats. These error probability expressions are then applied to three types of channel estimation errors potentially encountered in practical systems to study their impact on the performance of selection diversity. Moreover, single integral formulas with finite integration limits are derived for the performance of SSC and SEC systems with minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Optimum switching thresholds for 2-D modulation formats with MMSE based switched combining are acquired through numerical computation.","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/33280/01573872.pdf","startPage":"2054","endPage":"2065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.858167","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2005.858167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573872","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Fading","Channel estimation","Amplitude modulation","Integral equations","Error probability","Performance analysis","Ice","Rayleigh channels","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","channel estimation","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channels","imperfect channel estimation","switch-and-stay combining","switch-and-examine combining system","M-ary pulse amplitude modulation","PAM","rectangular-quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","symbol error probability","minimum mean square error","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Imperfect channel estimation (ICE)","minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation","pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM)","pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)","Rayleigh fading","selection combining (SC)","switch-and-stay combining (SSC)","switch-and-examine combining (SEC)","two-dimensional (2-D) signaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573872/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Error performance of selection combining and switched combining systems in Rayleigh fading channels with imperfect channel estimation","accessionNumber":"8808807","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1573872/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error performance of selection combining and switched combining systems in Rayleigh fading channels with imperfect channel estimation","sourcePdf":"01573872.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062578S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573872","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1573873,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We propose a new method for selecting the appropriate modulation and coding schemes (MCS) according to the estimated channel condition. In this method, we take a statistical decision making approach to maximize the average throughput while maintaining an acceptable frame error rate (FER). We use a first order finite state Markov model to approximate the time variations of the average channel signal to noise ratio (SNR) in subsequent frames. The MCS is selected in each state of this Markov model (among the choices proposed in the 3G standards proposals) to maximize the statistical average of the throughput in that state. Using this decision making approach, we also propose a simplified Markov model with fewer parameters, which is suitable in systems where changes in the fading characteristics need to be accounted for in an adaptive fashion. Numerical results are presented showing that both of our models substantially outperform the conventional techniques that use a memoryless threshold based decision making.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2005.853445","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/33280/01573873.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.853445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"2066","endPage":"2073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical decision making in adaptive modulation and coding for 3G wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1573873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Statistical decision making in adaptive modulation and coding for 3G wireless systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573873/","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1573873/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8808808","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical decision making in adaptive modulation and coding for 3G wireless systems","sourcePdf":"01573873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093339S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":1573875,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The bound is based on uniform interleaving of the coded sequence prior to transmission over the channel. The distribution of error bits over the fading blocks is computed. For a specific distribution pattern, the pairwise error probability is derived. Block-fading channels modeled as Rician and Nakagami distributions are studied. We consider coherent receivers with perfect and imperfect channel side information (SI) as well as noncoherent receivers employing square-law combining. Throughout the paper, imperfect SI is obtained using pilot-aided estimation. A lower bound on the performance of iterative receivers that perform joint decoding and channel estimation is obtained assuming the receiver knows the correct data and uses them as pilots. From this, the tradeoff between channel diversity and channel estimation is investigated and the optimal channel memory is approximated analytically.

We present optimal scheduling algorithms that selectively transmit data at calculated rates so that the throughput or the total transmission value is maximized under given time limits and energy constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1573879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8808814","htmlLink":"/document/1573879/","displayDocTitle":"Improving communication energy efficiency in wireless networks powered by Renewable energy sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving communication energy efficiency in wireless networks powered by Renewable energy sources","sourcePdf":"01573879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093753S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"33280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33280","articleId":"1573879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1573880,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["Department of ECpE, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Yao Ma","id":"37274225200"},{"name":"R.

Typically, information concerning ground and air targets is obtained via monostatic radar. Increased information is often equated with increased bandwidth in these radar systems. However, geometric diversity obtained through multistatic radar operations also affords the user the opportunity to obtain additional information concerning threat targets. With the appropriate signal processing, this translates directly into increased probability of detection and reduced probability of false alarm. In the extreme case, only discrete ultra narrow band (UNB) frequencies of operation may be available for both commercial and military applications. With limited spectrum, UNB in the limiting case, the need for geometric diversity becomes imperative. This occurs because the electromagnetic spectrum available for commercial and military radar applications is continuously being eroded while the need for increased information via radio frequency (RF) detection of threat targets is increasing. In addition, geometric diversity improves target position accuracy and image resolution, which would otherwise remain unavailable with monostatic radar.","displayPublicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10512/33291/01574177.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1574177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra narrow band adaptive tomographic radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Tomography","Radar applications","Radar detection","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Radar signal processing","Limiting","Electromagnetic spectrum","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tomography","ultra wideband radar","diversity reception","military radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra narrow band adaptive tomographic radar","spatial diversity","monostatic radar","geometric diversity","signal processing","electromagnetic spectrum","military radar applications","radio frequency detection","image resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Ultra narrow band adaptive tomographic radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8894199","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra narrow band adaptive tomographic radar","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01574177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033505S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","isNumber":"33291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10512","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1574177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1574181,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Here, we consider the general case where each relay node is equipped with N/sub T/ antennas and the destination node has N/sub R/ antennas. It is assumed that at any given time only a small, a priori unknown subset of nodes S C N is active. In the proposed scheme, the signal transmitted by an active node is the product of an information-carrying space-time block code (STBC) matrix, which is identical for all nodes, and a unique node signature matrix. It is shown that existing STBCs designed for N/sub c/ /spl ges/ 2 co-located antennas are a favorable choice for the code matrix guaranteeing a diversity order of d = min {N/sub c/N/sub R/, N/sub T/N/sub S/N/sub R/} if ns nodes are active.

The problem is a multicast generalization of the SENR-constrained multiuser downlink beamforming problem: the difference is that each transmitted stream is directed to multiple receivers, each with its own channel. Such generalization is relevant and timely, e.g., in the context of 802.16 wireless networks. Based on earlier results for a single multicast group, the joint problem is easily shown to be NP-hard, a fact that motivates the pursuit of quasi-optimal computationally efficient solutions. It is shown that Lagrangian relaxation coupled with a randomization/co-channel multicast power control loop yields a computationally efficient high-quality approximate solution. For a significant fraction of problem instances, the solutions generated this way are exactly optimal. Carefully designed and extensive simulation results are presented to support the main findings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming to multiple co-channel multicast groups","publicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574196","displayPublicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10512/33291/01574196.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1574196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming to multiple co-channel multicast groups","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902643","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming to multiple co-channel multicast groups","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01574196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027621S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","isNumber":"33291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10512","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1574196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1574197,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The link between both stages is practical, intuitive, and simple. The robust MIMO design is based on a worst-case approach that maximizes via convex optimization procedures the worst possible signal to noise ratio (SNR) given a specified channel uncertainty region. The scheduling policy, also calculated with convex optimization techniques, minimizes the total number of utilized subcarriers. Therefore, the design is scalable in the sense of having the capability to incorporate new future potential users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust scheduling in MIMO-OFDM multi-user systems based on convex optimization","publicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574197","displayPublicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10512/33291/01574197.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1574197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Robust scheduling in MIMO-OFDM multi-user systems based on convex optimization","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902644","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust scheduling in MIMO-OFDM multi-user systems based on convex optimization","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01574197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033704S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","isNumber":"33291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10512","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1574197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1574198,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulations indicate that our proposed precoder design greatly improves the performance of the system","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574206","publicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"1st IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10512/33291/01574206.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","doi":"10.1109/CAMAP.2005.1574206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The pairwise error probability and precoder design for amplify-and-forward half-duplex cooperative system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"The pairwise error probability and precoder design for amplify-and-forward half-duplex cooperative system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8912520","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574206/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The pairwise error probability and precoder design for amplify-and-forward half-duplex cooperative system","confLoc":"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01574206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041973S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2005","isNumber":"33291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10512","articleId":"1574206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1574207,"authors":[{"name":"Hung Tuan Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"lastName":"Hung Tuan Nguyen","id":"37278173500"},{"name":"G.

A timely update of the channel state information is an obvious solution to improve the system performance in a time-varying channel. However, this comes at the cost of a decrease in the system throughput since many pilots have to be inserted. Thus, predicting the future channel conditions can improve not only the performance but also the throughput of many types of wireless systems. This is especially true when multiple antennas are applied at both link ends. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the performance of a prediction scheme for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems that apply spatial multiplexing. We aim at predicting the future precoder/decoder directly without going through the prediction of the channel matrix.

The interpolating functions are 'metamodels' (or 'response surfaces') of the underlying simulation models. For sensitivity analysis and optimization, simulationists use different interpolation techniques (e.g. low-order polynomial regression or neural nets). This paper, however, focuses on Kriging interpolation. In the 1950's, D.G. Krige developed this technique for the mining industry. Currently, Kriging interpolation is frequently applied in computer aided engineering. In discrete event simulation, however, Kriging has just started. This paper discusses Kriging for sensitivity analysis in simulation, including methods to select an experimental design for Kriging interpolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-4 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1574252/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8903425","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Kriging metamodeling in discrete-event simulation: an overview","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kriging metamodeling in discrete-event simulation: an overview","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01574252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.201718S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10515","isNumber":"33294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10515","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33294","articleId":"1574252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1574253,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

In the doubly-salient PM machines, the phase flux linkage is unipolar, which compromises the back-emf per coil and torque capability, while its phase back-emf waveform is more trapezoidal and hence it is more suitable for brushless DC operation. In the flux-switching PM machines, the phase flux linkage is bipolar, and hence it exhibits significantly higher torque density. Both phase flux linkage and phase back-emf waveforms of flux-switching PM machines are essentially sinusoidal, which makes it most appropriate for brushless AC operation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33302","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10523/33302/01574739.pdf","endPage":"170 Vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of flux-switching and doubly-salient permanent magnet brushless machines","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202506","startPage":"165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1574739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of flux-switching and doubly-salient permanent magnet brushless machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574739/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8902421","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1574739/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of flux-switching and doubly-salient permanent magnet brushless machines","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"01574739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078138S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10523","isNumber":"33302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10523","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"33302","articleId":"1574739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Int.

In this paper, the model of permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor is presented by using neural networks of the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs. Based on the same cost function, residual signal analysis is mixed into the networks, and then the networks can identify motor's ranks automatically. First, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs model is expanded into the polynomial function, then the condition which true ranks satisfy is presented by using residual signal analysis. Some shortages of BP (back-propagation algorithm) are considered, so NDEKF (node-decoupled extend Kalman filter) is applied to train networks. The experiment results show that the hybrid neural networks of the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs can identify object's (a vertical transport system driven by permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor) ranks precisely, and the output of networks is very close to the experimental result. In the experiments, the performance of NDEKF is often superior to that of BP, while requiring significantly fewer presentations of training data than BP and less over training time than that of BP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1574769/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8893827","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1574769/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid nonlinear autoregressive neural network for permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid nonlinear autoregressive neural network for permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor identification","confLoc":"Nanjing","sourcePdf":"01574769.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047939S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10523","isNumber":"33302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10523","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33302","articleId":"1574769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Int.

The effect of slot width pairing on cogging torque is studied, and some conclusions are drawn. If the least integer n, which makes (nz/2)/(2p) be an integer, is an even number, the cogging torque can be greatly reduced by different slot width pairing, and the method to calculate the width of slot is deduced in this paper. On the contrary, if the least n is an odd number, different slot width pairing method is not effective in reducing cogging torque.

A novel modulation strategy is applied by modulating the triangle carrier wave and two inverse sinusoidal modulation waves. It is no need of checking the pole of the output voltage to switch the drive signals, and it is able to weaken the distortion of the output on zero passage. This 2-DOF PI controller has two parameters to be designed separately and can obtain good dynamic responses both in the command tracking and load disturbance regulation characteristic. In this paper, the 2-DOF PI digital controller for the inverter system is designed and implemented to obtain high dynamic and static performance. The parameters of the controller are found by model building, theoretical deduction according to the desired specifications.

Not only are the two forces nonlinear functions of positions, but also the levitation forces in two degrees of freedom have strongly coupled nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, the nonlinear coupled relationship exits between the levitation force and rotation force too. In order to realize the stable levitation and controlled rotation of bearingless switched reluctance motors, the first step is to dynamically decouple the levitation forces in different positions and to search for control laws in different positions. Based on basic electromagnetism theory, a radial force and position model of a bearingless switched reluctance motor is presented. Aimed at the nonlinear and strongly coupled characteristics, the model is analyzed with reversibility and proved to be reversible. The nonlinear and strongly coupled multi-variables system can be decoupled and transformed into two linear subsystems without position coupling to each other by connecting a neural network inverse system before a bearingless switched reluctance motor. This neural network inverse system consists of a static neural network (MLN or RBF network) and two integrators, where the static neural network represents the nonlinear mapping relation of the inverse system and the integrators represent the dynamic characteristics of the inverse system. Consequently, the high performance control of the original nonlinear and coupled system can be realized under the help of linear closed-loop controllers for each decoupled subsystem. The results of simulation show that this system can realize the stable levitation of bearingless switched reluctance motors.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202873","pdfPath":"/iel5/10523/33304/01575070.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1815 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic decoupling control of bearingless switched reluctance motors based on neural network inverse system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic decoupling control of bearingless switched reluctance motors based on neural network inverse system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8976633","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575070/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic decoupling control of bearingless switched reluctance motors based on neural network inverse system","confLoc":"Nanjing","sourcePdf":"01575070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061498S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10523","isNumber":"33304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10523","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33304","articleId":"1575070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Int.

While the simplex method introduced in a later reference can be used for hand solution of LP problems, computer use becomes necessary even for a small number of variables. Problems involving diet decisions, transportation, production and manufacturing, product mix, engineering limit analysis in design, airline scheduling, and so on are solved using computers.

Two diagonal recurrent neural networks are employed to detect turn fault. One is used to estimate the fault severity, the other is used to determine the exact number of fault turns. In order to make the diagonal recurrent neural network model more simple and accurate, an adaptive dynamic back propagation algorithm is proposed to determine the optimum number of the hidden layer neurons.

The produced heat source in the strip was supposed to move in elements in the opposite direction of the actually continuously moving strip for transverse flux induction heating (TFIH), thus every temperature field computation could take advantage of the heat source distribution resulted from the former eddy current field calculation, which led to the time for numerical simulation of TFIH reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202988","startPage":"2339","endPage":"2342 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10523/33304/01575185.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2005.202988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for optimal design of transverse flux inductor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Inductors","Strips","Convergence","Electromagnetic coupling","Temperature distribution","Distributed computing","Eddy currents","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","eddy currents","genetic algorithms","induction heating","inductors","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","transverse flux inductor","subpopulation competition","data exchange method","electromagnetic-thermal problems","coupling procedure","transverse flux induction heating","heat source distribution","eddy current field calculation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-29 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for optimal design of transverse flux inductor","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1575185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8966993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved genetic algorithm for optimal design of transverse flux inductor","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"01575185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061552S","chronDate":"29-29 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10523","isNumber":"33304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10523","xplore-issue":"33304","articleId":"1575185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Int.

It is used in connecting and disconnecting loads, fast restricting the increasing current in the case of over-load and short-circuit.

Surge-current and spike-voltage are the main reasons resulting in the malfunctioning of MOSFET and the reducing solid-state switch's reliability. In this paper, a soft-starting and soft-turning-off circuit of DC solid-state switch is introduced. Soft-starting is used to restrain the impact of the surge-current when solid-state switch is turned on. Soft-turning-off is used to suppress the spike-voltage of inductive loads between the drain and source of MOSFET when solid-state switch is turned off. Based on RC nets, this circuit is simple and practical. The experimental results show that the soft-starting and soft-turning-off circuit improves the ability of carrying loads and has a strong controlling ability.

Unexpected and unpredictable behaviors of devices usually lead to poor quality and reliability. Low-cost test techniques that improves die sorting accuracy thus are critical for advanced devices. Flash memory is more prone to such problem compared with others. Large capacity, high density, and complicated cell structure makes flash memory cell behavior difficult to predict precisely. Even when we test the dies on the same wafer it can be bothering, as each of them may ask for different test condition due to geometric process variation. As a fast and easy-to-use method to solve the problem, we propose a sample classification method. It is not only effective for flash memory testing, but also for other types of circuits that face similar test problem. Experimental result shows that the method solves the flash memory die sort problem efficiently and accurately. The test time is greatly reduced-for an industrial chip, the test time is reduced from 8,817 ms to 718 ms. Moreover, the proposed approach is also suitable for design-for-testability (DFT) implementation that can easily be integrated with a commodity or embedded memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575427/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Flash Memory Die Sort by a Sample Classification Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash Memory Die Sort by a Sample Classification Method","confLoc":"Calcutta","sourcePdf":"01575427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052782S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10525","isNumber":"33306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10525","xplore-issue":"33306","articleId":"1575427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1575465,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Different methods are used to select the flip-flops for the scan path, which are based on the structure of the circuit, and some testability measures. However, most of the methods just focus on a single method and at most two for partial scan path design. In this paper, we propose a new approach for selection of flip-flops in partial scan path design. We try to incorporate three different methods into one and optimize them using genetic algorithm. The testability approach is used to estimate how the selection of a particular flip-flop affects its neighboring flip-flops. Focus is also given to those flip-flops whose selection tends to break maximum number of cycles. Finally we try to optimize is to minimize the overall power consumption of the modified circuit. The experimental results show that though it is not always possible to improve upon the performances of techniques which focus only on single objective, on an average fairly good results are obtained in terms of fault coverage, number of vectors and the power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2005.18","startPage":"414","endPage":"421","displayPublicationTitle":"14th Asian Test Symposium (ATS'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10525/33306/01575465.pdf","publicationTitle":"14th Asian Test Symposium (ATS'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2005.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach to Partial Scan Design using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Flip-flops","Circuit testing","Costs","Design for testability","Energy consumption","Automatic test pattern generation","Sequential circuits","Computer science"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Partial Scan Design using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575465/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Partial Scan Design using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Calcutta, India","sourcePdf":"01575465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054983S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10525","isNumber":"33306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10525","xplore-issue":"33306","articleId":"1575465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1575468,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Given an online handwritten character sample, a series of processing steps, including linear size normalization, adding imaginary strokes, nonlinear shape normalization, equidistance resampling, and smoothing, are performed to derive a 64/spl times/64 normalized online character sample. Then, 8-directional features are extracted from each online trajectory point, and 8 directional pattern images are generated accordingly, from which blurred directional features are extracted at 8/spl times/8 uniformly sampled locations using a filter derived from the Gaussian envelope of a Gabor filter. Finally, a 512-dimensional vector of raw features is formed. Extensive experiments on the task of recognizing 3755 level-1 Chinese characters in GB2312-80 standard are performed to compare and discern the best setting for several algorithmic choices and control parameters. The effectiveness of the studied approach is confirmed.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.34","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575550.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"266 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the use of 8-directional features for online handwritten Chinese character recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A study on the use of 8-directional features for online handwritten Chinese character recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8747301","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575550/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the use of 8-directional features for online handwritten Chinese character recognition","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078455S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1575568,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We show that this approach can be improved if the decision about a gap is not only made in terms of a threshold, but also depends on the context of that gap, i.e. if the relative sizes of the surrounding gaps are taken into consideration. For this purpose, we propose to build a structure tree of the text line, whose nodes represent possible word candidates. Such a tree is traversed in a top-down manner to find the nodes that correspond to words of the text line. Experiments with different gap metrics as well as threshold types show that the new method can yield significant improvements over conventional word extraction methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.245","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575568.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","startPage":"352","endPage":"356 Vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree structure for word extraction from handwritten text lines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1575568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tree structure for word extraction from handwritten text lines","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575568/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8747319","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1575568/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree structure for word extraction from handwritten text lines","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037702S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1575593,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Currently most methods for numeral string recognition require segmenting the string image into separate numerals. As a result, the recognition system heavily depends on the reliability of the segmentation module. This study explores the holistic strategy directly on the string images without segmentation. It builds the novel classifier by combining binary classifiers based on data-driven error correcting output coding (DECOC). The dimensions of input images are reduced using principal components analysis. Support vector machines are used as base learners. Experiments on NIST SD19 touching numeral pairs confirm that DECOC can achieve favorable performance compared with other multi-class holistic classifiers. The method provides the flexibility of controlling the computational complexity versus accuracy. We also discuss an implementation suitable for distributing computing by decomposing the ensemble into subtasks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.246","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575593.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"488 Vol. 1","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained numeral pair recognition using enhanced error correcting output coding: a holistic approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained numeral pair recognition using enhanced error correcting output coding: a holistic approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575593/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8747343","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained numeral pair recognition using enhanced error correcting output coding: a holistic approach","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065979S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1575595,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this paper, we propose a method to train SVM for off-line character recognition based on the artificially augmented examples using on-line characters. In our method, a virtual example is synthesized from an on-line character by applying affine transformation to each stroke. SVM classifiers are trained by using the artificially generated patterns. To reject inappropriate artificial examples, a preliminary SVM is learned from the original set of samples, and then used for data selection. Using the augmented training samples, the final SVM is obtained. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments of handwritten Japanese Hiragana character classification.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.170","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575595.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"498 Vol. 1","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-line handwritten character recognition by SVM based on the virtual examples synthesized from on-line characters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Off-line handwritten character recognition by SVM based on the virtual examples synthesized from on-line characters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8747345","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-line handwritten character recognition by SVM based on the virtual examples synthesized from on-line characters","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039795S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1575605,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The prerecognition component annotates each detected letter with shape information, to be used for recognition in future work.","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575616.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"609 Vol. 2","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1575616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation and pre-recognition of Arabic handwriting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Shape","Hidden Markov models","Image recognition","Venus","Computer science","Testing","Natural languages","Handwriting recognition","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","handwriting recognition","image segmentation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arabic handwriting segmentation","Arabic handwriting recognition","handwritten Arabic text","character segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation and pre-recognition of Arabic handwriting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575616/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8732683","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation and pre-recognition of Arabic handwriting","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040229S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1575624,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghui Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Xianghui Wei","id":"37087258482"},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology & System, CST Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shaoping Ma","id":"37087146740"},{"name":"Yijiang Jin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology & System, CST Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yijiang Jin","id":"37087145426"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2420-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-5363"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-2140"}],"articleNumber":"1575624","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1575624","abstract":"The accuracy of segmenting Chinese character, especially connected Chinese characters, is essential for the performance of a Chinese character recognition system. In this paper, a new approach for segmenting connected Chinese characters based on genetic algorithm is proposed. The best segmentation path is evolved by genetic algorithm from a fixed area located in the middle of character image which is defined as segmentation path zone (SPZ). The initial population is composed of each point line in SPZ. The individual coding, fitness function, crossover operator and mutation operator are also defined for this task. Experimental results on a dataset extracted from the four vaults show that our approach can get an average accuracy of 88.9% on test set and can handle some complex types of connected Chinese characters without special heuristic rules.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.209","startPage":"645","endPage":"649 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575624.pdf","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of connected Chinese characters based on genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image segmentation","Character recognition","Upper bound","Software performance","Content addressable storage","Genetic mutations","Testing","Optical character recognition software","Skeleton"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","genetic algorithms","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character segmentation","genetic algorithm","Chinese character recognition system","segmentation path zone","fitness function","crossover operator","mutation operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of connected Chinese characters based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575624/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8732691","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of connected Chinese characters based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066558S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1575631,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yan Chen","id":"37069010600"},{"name":"G.

The readjusted weighted value matrix is applied to the blind source matrix to separate the word components. The algorithm has been evaluated on 30 overlapped document images from the CEDAR letter database and another 30 degraded historical document images, which containing many different kinds of overlapping and touching words in adjacent lines. Quantitative analysis of the results by measuring text recall, and qualitative assessment of processed document image quality is reported.

At the same time, they may be too slow for practical character recognition, especially when they rely on similarity measures that require computationally expensive pair-wise alignments between characters. This paper proposes an efficient method for computing an approximate similarity score between two characters based on their exact alignment to a small number of prototypes. The proposed method is applied to both online and offline character recognition, where similarity is based on widely used and computationally expensive alignment methods, i.e., dynamic time warping and the Hungarian method respectively. In both cases significant recognition speedup is obtained at the expense of only a minor increase in recognition error.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2005.177","pdfPath":"/iel5/10526/33307/01575663.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"843 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","publicationTitle":"Eighth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2005.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online and offline character recognition using alignment to prototypes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Online and offline character recognition using alignment to prototypes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8732730","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1575663/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online and offline character recognition using alignment to prototypes","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01575663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048074S","chronDate":"29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10526","isNumber":"33307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10526","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33307","articleId":"1575663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1575666,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, allocation decisions and associated performance prediction are often based on estimated values of application and system parameters. The actual values of these parameters may differ from the estimates; for example, the estimates may represent only average values, the models used to generate the estimates may have limited accuracy, and there may be changes in the environment. Thus, an important research problem is the development of resource management strategies that can guarantee a particular system performance given such uncertainties. To address this problem, we have designed a model for deriving the degree of robustness of a resource allocation-the maximum amount of collective uncertainty in system parameters within which a user-specified level of system performance (QoS) can be guaranteed. The model is presented and we demonstrate its ability to select the most robust resource allocation from among those that otherwise perform similarly (based oh the primary performance criterion). The model's use in allocation heuristics is also demonstrated. This model is applicable to different types of computing and communication environments, including parallel, distributed, cluster; grid, Internet, embedded, and wireless.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33309","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10528/33309/01575796.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISPAN.2005.75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPAN.2005.75","startPage":"8 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust resource allocations in parallel computing systems: model and heuristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575796/","displayDocTitle":"Robust resource allocations in parallel computing systems: model and heuristics","htmlLink":"/document/1575796/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8846533","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust resource allocations in parallel computing systems: model and heuristics","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01575796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108236S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10528","isNumber":"33309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10528","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33309","articleId":"1575796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1575805,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"lastName":"Mei Yang","id":"37277306000"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Tao Li","id":"37280718600"},{"name":"Yinglao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV, USA"],"lastName":"Yinglao Jiang","id":"37279388100"},{"name":"Yulu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yulu Yang","id":"37280595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2509-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-527X"}],"articleNumber":"1575805","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"abstract":"It has been well recognized that the fault-tolerance capability is vital for a NoC system, since one faulty link/processor may isolate a large fraction of processors. Continuing from a previous paper where a RDT(2,2,1)//spl alpha/-based interconnection network for NoC designs was proposed, we investigate fault-tolerant routing schemes on NoC systems featuring a RDT-based interconnection network. In particular, we propose two fault-tolerant routing schemes in the presence of either single link/node failure or multiple link/node failures. The proposed routing schemes are based on deterministic routing. Alternative routes are discovered by properly selecting the intermediate nodes between the source and the destination nodes on the rank tori. As of the single link/node failure case, we show that the number of routers on the detoured route generated by the proposed routing scheme is at most 2 more than the number of routers on the original route.","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10528/33309/01575805.pdf","startPage":"6 pp.","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","doi":"10.1109/ISPAN.2005.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPAN.2005.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1575805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerant routing schemes in RDT(2,2,1)//spl alpha/-based interconnection network for networks-on-chip design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Routing","Intelligent networks","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Network-on-a-chip","Isolation technology","Fault tolerant systems","Very large scale integration","Computer science","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","network routing","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network-on-chip","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant routing scheme","RDT(2,2,1)//spl alpha/-based interconnection network","network-on-chip designs","NoC system","single link-node failure scheme","multiple link-node failure scheme","deterministic routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerant routing schemes in RDT(2,2,1)//spl alpha/-based interconnection network for networks-on-chip design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846542","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerant routing schemes in RDT(2,2,1)//spl alpha/-based interconnection network for networks-on-chip design","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01575805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063981S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10528","isNumber":"33309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10528","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33309","articleId":"1575805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1575826,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

In this paper we consider distributed implementations in which the outcome is computed by the agents themselves. We propose a distributed mechanism for solving the problem of scheduling on unrelated machines. This mechanism, called distributed MinWork (DMW) is a distributed implementation of the MinWork mechanism proposed by Nisan and Ronen. DMW is resilient to agents deviating from the protocol since the cheaters are detected and eliminated from further participation. We show that DMW is truthful, since it preserves the incentives and allocation policies from MinWork. Finally, we show that DMW has polynomial communication and computation costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575826/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575826/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8846563","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed algorithmic mechanism design for scheduling on unrelated machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed algorithmic mechanism design for scheduling on unrelated machines","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01575826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063477S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10528","isNumber":"33309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10528","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33309","articleId":"1575826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1575857,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Hui Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Hui Jin","id":"37087166162"},{"name":"Win-Zing Liu","affiliation":["Tong An Element School, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Win-Zing Liu","id":"37088051531"},{"name":"D.F.

Several high performance computing vendors offer parallel re configurable computers employing user-programmable FPGAs. These exciting new architectures allow end-users to, in effect, create reconfigurable coprocessors targeting the computationally intensive parts of each problem. The increased capability of contemporary FPGAs coupled with the embarrassingly parallel nature of the Jacobi iterative method make the Jacobi method an ideal candidate for hardware acceleration. This paper introduces a parameterized design for a deeply pipelined, highly parallelized IEEE 64-bit floating-point version of the Jacobi method. A Jacobi circuit is implemented using a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro as the target FPGA device. Implementation statistics and performance estimates are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ISPAN.2005.18","publicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures,Algorithms and Networks (ISPAN'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10528/33309/01575859.pdf","startPage":"8 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPAN.2005.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1575859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based floating-point Jacobi iterative solver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1575859/","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based floating-point Jacobi iterative solver","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1575859/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8846596","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based floating-point Jacobi iterative solver","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"01575859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060463S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10528","isNumber":"33309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10528","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"33309","articleId":"1575859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1575963,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the reverse link of CDMA systems are, for a given channel and noise conditions, interference-limited, the sum capacity can be achieved by optimally allocating the transmit powers of the mobile stations with the optimal (Shannon) coding. Unfortunately, the sum capacity is usually achieved via unfair resource allocation. This can be avoided by imposing QoS constraints on the system. The results here show that for a single cell system, the sum capacity can be achieved while meeting the QoS constraints with a semi-bang-bang power allocation strategy. Numerical results are then presented to show the multi-user diversity gain and the impact of QoS constraints. The implication of TDM operation in a practical reverse link CDMA system is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1576517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/33321/01576517.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1576517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Constrained information-theoretic sum capacity of reverse link CDMA.

Conventional signal-to-interference (SIR) prediction-based power control schemes may incur prediction mistakes caused by the adjustment of transmission power. The proposed power control scheme purely tracks the variation of channel effect and, thus, can be immune to any power adjustment. Furthermore, it adopts the PRNN with ERLS for predicting the channel effect.

However, time-selective fading channels do exist, and in such case conventional O-STBC detectors can suffer from a large error floor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases. As a sequel to the authors' previous papers on this subject, this paper aims to eliminate the error floor of the H/sub i/-coded O-STBC system (i = 3 and 4) by employing the techniques of: 1) zero forcing (ZF) and 2) parallel interference cancellation (PIC). It is. shown that for an H/sub i/-coded system the PIC is a much better choice than the ZF in terms of both performance and computational complexity. Compared with the, conventional H/sub i/ detector, the PIC detector incurs a moderately higher computational complexity, but this can well be justified by the enormous improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576524/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8982930","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal detection for orthogonal space-time block coding over time-selective fading channels: The H/sub i/ systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal detection for orthogonal space-time block coding over time-selective fading channels: The H/sub i/ systems","sourcePdf":"01576524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111135S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"33321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33321","articleId":"1576524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576525,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Two-dimensional pilot-symbol assisted modulation (2D-PSAM) is employed in coherent OFDM for channel estimation, and it is based on inserting known symbols spread throughout the 2D time-frequency grid. These pilot symbols are employed to simultaneously perform distortionless peak power reduction with a suboptimum technique named orthogonal pilot sequences (OPS), which reduces additional system complexity and side information compared to optimum pilot values.

Therefore we also consider two possible switching schemes, called pre-switching and post-switching, which activate the ICA-based jammer canceller only when it is expected to improve conventional detection.

In contrast to state-of-the-art stochastic MIMO channel models, the spatial correlation properties of the channel are not divided into separate contributions from transmitter and receiver. Instead, the joint correlation properties are modeled by describing the average coupling between the eigenmodes of the two link ends. The necessary and sufficient condition for the proposed model to hold is that the eigenbasis at the receiver is independent of the transmit weights, and vice versa. The authors discuss the mathematical elements of the model, which can be easily extracted from measurements, from a radio propagation point of view and explain the underlying assumption of the model in physical terms. The validation of the proposed model by means of measured data obtained from two completely different measurement campaigns reveals its ability to better predict capacity and spatial channel structure than other popular stochastic channel models.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1576533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/33321/01576533.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1576533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic MIMO channel model with joint correlation of both link ends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic MIMO channel model with joint correlation of both link ends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576533/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8982939","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576533/","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic MIMO channel model with joint correlation of both link ends","sourcePdf":"01576533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092802S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"33321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"350","xplore-issue":"33321","articleId":"1576533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1576534,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The physical channel considered is assumed to be multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) with intersymbol interference (ISI) and space-time correlated noise. STMC is a space-time block code (STBC) system. Most of the STMC systems require a long guard period to avoid interblock interference (IBI), but, with the proposed equalizer, the length of the guard period is greatly reduced. This can enhance the spectral efficiency of the STMC especially when the channel dispersion is large. The existence conditions for FIR ZFE of the STMC system were derived. These include the maximal code rate STMC for a given channel and the minimal filter order of the FIR ZFE. For a given STMC precoder, the equalizability of the system was verified. The solution of FIR ZFE of STMC was parameterized, which allows the design of optimal FIR ZFE through unconstrained optimization. It is further shown that FIR ZFE could be improved by adding a simple permutation in the system. Design examples and simulation results were presented to evaluate the proposed design method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR zero-forcing equalizer for ISI MIMO channels using space-time modulated codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1576536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/33321/01576536.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1576536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"FIR zero-forcing equalizer for ISI MIMO channels using space-time modulated codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576536/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8982942","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIR zero-forcing equalizer for ISI MIMO channels using space-time modulated codes","sourcePdf":"01576536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06044S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"33321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33321","articleId":"1576536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1576537,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The authors focus on the semicorrelated scenario in which correlation exists either at the transmitter or at the receiver., They consider two cases: 1) the transmitter does not have any CSI and as such allocates power equally among transmitter antennas and 2) the transmitter only knows the statistical distribution of the channel. The first case derives the moment generating function (MGF) of the mutual information (MI) and then deduces from this MGF the mean MI. The authors also study the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the MI, which can serve as an upper bound to the outage probability under the capacity versus outage formulation when the channel is nonergodic. The second case studies the capacity achieved by optimum power-loading and beamforming schemes based on covariance feedback. Numerical results illustrate that the full capacity of MIMO systems can be preserved even for relatively high values of correlation coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1576538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/33321/01576538.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1576538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of correlated MIMO Rayleigh channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576538/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of correlated MIMO Rayleigh channels","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8982944","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576538/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of correlated MIMO Rayleigh channels","sourcePdf":"01576538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.752542S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"33321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"33321","articleId":"1576538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576541,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, big technical challenges for vertical-handover (VHO) strategy arise for such an integrated system. According to different interruption types and traffic modes, two basic VHO schemes can be applied: immediate VHO (I-VHO) and dwell VHO (D-VHO). This paper proposes a novel fuzzy-logic (FL)-based decision-making algorithm for VHO, which is capable of combining the merits of both schemes to achieve excellent handover in terms of packet transfer delay for all the cases considered here. The strength of FL in handling uncertain and conflicting decision metrics is exploited. Since excessive transfer delay results in disrupted connection and corrupted service, the proposed FL-based VHO decision-making algorithm has the potential to provide a better quality of service (QoS) to users in future wireless broadband communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/33321/01576541.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2006.1576541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2006.1576541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vertical handover-decision-making algorithm using fuzzy logic for the integrated Radio-and-OW system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Fuzzy logic","Quality of service","Data communication","Integrated optics","Delay","Wireless networks","GSM","Bit error rate","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy logic","optical communication","data communication","quality of service","broadband networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical handover decision-making algorithm","fuzzy logic","integrated radio","optical wireless","data transmission","transfer delay","quality of service","QoS","wireless broadband communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Vertical handover-decision-making algorithm using fuzzy logic for the integrated Radio-and-OW system","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576541/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8982947","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vertical handover-decision-making algorithm using fuzzy logic for the integrated Radio-and-OW system","sourcePdf":"01576541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070675S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"33321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"33321","articleId":"1576541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1576543,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Prairie View A and M University, Prairie View, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/33321/1576543/1576543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lijun Qian is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Prairie View AM University.

Unfortunately, its detailed implementation has never been made available in the literature. This paper investigates the PPI based on limited published results and proposes a fast iterative algorithm to implement the PPI, referred to as fast iterative PPI (FIPPI). It improves the PPI in several aspects. Instead of using randomly generated vectors as initial endmembers, the FIPPI produces an appropriate initial set of endmembers to speed up its process. Additionally, it estimates the number of endmembers required to be generated by a recently developed concept, virtual dimensionality (VD) which is one of the most crucial issues in the implementation of PPI. Furthermore, it is an iterative algorithm, where an iterative rule is developed to improve each of the iterations until it reaches a final set of endmembers. Most importantly, it is an unsupervised algorithm as opposed to the PPI, which requires human intervention to manually select a final set of endmembers. The experiments show that both the FIPPI and the PPI produce very close results, but the FIPPI converges very rapidly with significant savings in computation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33327/01576691.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.856701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.856701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast iterative algorithm for implementation of pixel purity index","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Hyperspectral imaging","Indexes","Pixel","Image analysis","Humans","Hyperspectral sensors","Computer science","Availability","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","feature extraction","remote sensing","iterative methods","geophysical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative algorithm","hyperspectral image analysis","Environment for Visualizing Images software","ENVI software","virtual dimensionality","unsupervised algorithm","automatic target generation process","endmember extraction algorithm","endmember pixel","fast iterative pixel purity index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic target generation process (ATGP)","endmember extraction algorithm (EEA)","endmember pixel","fast iterative pixel purity index (FIPPI)","pixel purity index (PPI)","virtual dimensionality (VD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"A fast iterative algorithm for implementation of pixel purity index","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576691/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727166","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast iterative algorithm for implementation of pixel purity index","sourcePdf":"01576691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052064S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"33327","articleId":"1576691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1576692,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

This dataset can support decadal assessments of environmental and land-cover change, production of reflectance-based biophysical products, and applications that merge reflectance data from multiple sensors [e.g., the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. The raw imagery was obtained from the orthorectified Landsat GeoCover dataset, purchased by NASA from the Earth Satellite Corporation. Through the LEDAPS project, these data were calibrated, converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and then atmospherically corrected using the MODIS/6S methodology. Initial comparisons with ground-based optical thickness measurements and simultaneously acquired MODIS imagery indicate comparable uncertainty in Landsat surface reflectance compared to the standard MODIS reflectance product (the greater of 0.5% absolute reflectance or 5% of the recorded reflectance value). The rapid automated nature of the processing stream also paves the way for routine high-level products from future Landsat sensors.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.857030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33327/01576692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.857030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33327","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Landsat surface reflectance dataset for North America, 1990-2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Landsat surface reflectance dataset for North America, 1990-2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576692/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727167","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576692/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Landsat surface reflectance dataset for North America, 1990-2000","sourcePdf":"01576692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060949S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"999","xplore-issue":"33327","articleId":"1576692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":1576693,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Nan Wu","id":"37953146100"},{"name":"Da-Zheng Feng","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Da-Zheng Feng","id":"37275288300"},{"name":"Junxia Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Junxia Li","id":"37964111100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"1576693","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"We propose an adaptive filtering approach for interferograms, which is a modification to the Lee adaptive complex filter.

Moreover, the computation of the filter parameter does not require local phase unwrapping in the real plane. This filter minimizes the loss of signal and reduces the level of noise. By using two sets of simulated data, its effectiveness can be seen in terms of the fidelity to noise-free phases, fringe preservation, and residue reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33327/01576693.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.856703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.856703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A locally adaptive filter of interferometric phase images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering","Frequency estimation","Phase estimation","Phase noise","Interferometry","Decorrelation","Interpolation","Noise reduction","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","adaptive signal processing","adaptive filters","geophysical techniques","interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interferometric phase images","adaptive filtering approach","interferograms","Lee adaptive complex filter","local phase fringes","filtering window","filter parameter","signal loss","noise level","fringe preservation","residue reduction","frequency estimate","interferometry","phase filtering","synthetic aperture radar","SAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency estimate","interferometry","phase filtering","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"A locally adaptive filter of interferometric phase images","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576693/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727168","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A locally adaptive filter of interferometric phase images","sourcePdf":"01576693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043627S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"33327","articleId":"1576693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1576695,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.M. de Wit","affiliation":["Defence, Security, and Safety in The Hague, Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J.J.M.","lastName":"de Wit","id":"37297834200"},{"name":"A.

In FM-CW SAR, the so-called stop-and-go approximation is no longer valid due to the relatively long sweeps that FM-CW radars transmit. The main effect of the continuous motion is a Doppler frequency shift throughout the SAR observation time.

We investigate the effects of including some of the target signal in the background scene. Although the covariance is contaminated by the presence of a target signal (there is increased variance in the direction of the target signature), we find that the matched filter is not necessarily affected. In fact, if the variation in plume strength is strictly uncorrelated with the variation in background spectra, the matched filter and its signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) performance will not be impaired. While there is little a priori reason to expect significant correlation between the plume and the background, there usually is some residual correlation, and this correlation leads to a suppressing effect that limits the SCR obtainable even for strong plumes. These effects are described and quantified analytically, and the crucial role of this correlation is illustrated with some numerical examples using simulated plumes superimposed on real hyperspectral imagery. In one example, we observe an order-of-magnitude loss in SCR for a matched filter based on the contaminated covariance.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.857619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33327/01576698.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.857619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of signal contamination in matched-filter detection of the signal on a cluttered background","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576698/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of signal contamination in matched-filter detection of the signal on a cluttered background","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727173","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576698/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of signal contamination in matched-filter detection of the signal on a cluttered background","sourcePdf":"01576698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05047S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"33327","articleId":"1576698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576704,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The resulting technique is compliant with the JPEG 2000 family of standards and provides competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/33327/01576704.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2005.859942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2005.859942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33327","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive 3-D coding of hyperspectral images based on JPEG 2000","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Hyperspectral imaging","Wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Decorrelation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Hyperspectral sensors","Performance loss","Multidimensional systems","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D hyperspectral image coding","JPEG 2000","spectral decorrelation","spatial decorrelation","3D set partitioning in hierarchical trees","discrete wavelet transform","lossless compression","lossy compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-dimensional set partitioning in hierarchical trees (3D-SPIHT)","discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","hyperspectral data","JPEG 2000","lossless and lossy compression","wavelet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Progressive 3-D coding of hyperspectral images based on JPEG 2000","volume":"3","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576704/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727179","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive 3-D coding of hyperspectral images based on JPEG 2000","sourcePdf":"01576704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089213S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"33327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"33327","articleId":"1576704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1576736,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Electrical, thermal, and phase-transformation mechanisms are considered to produce a physically realistic description of this new approach to ultrahigh-density data storage. Models developed are applied to the design of a suitable storage layer stack with the necessary electrical, thermal, and tribological properties to support recorded bits of nanometric scale. The detailed structure of nanoscale crystalline and amorphous bits is also predicted. For an optimized trilayer stack comprising Ge/sub 2/Sb/sub 2/Te/sub 5/ sandwiched by amorphous or diamond-like carbon layers, crystalline bits were roughly trapezoidal in shape while amorphous bits were semi-ellipsoidal. In both cases, the energy required to write individual bits was very low (of the order of a few hundred picoJoules). Amorphous marks could be directly overwritten (erased), but crystalline bits could not. Readout performance was investigated by calculating the readout current as the tip scanned over isolated bits and bit patterns of increasing density. The highest readout contrast was generated by isolated crystalline bits in an amorphous matrix, but the narrowest readout pulses arose from isolated amorphous marks in a crystalline background. To assess the ultimate density capability of electrical probe recording the role of write-induced intersymbol interference and the thermodynamic stability of nanoscale marks were also studied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terabit-per-square-inch data storage using phase-change media and scanning electrical nanoprobes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2005.861400","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/33328/01576737.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2005.861400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Terabit-per-square-inch data storage using phase-change media and scanning electrical nanoprobes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576737/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8730712","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terabit-per-square-inch data storage using phase-change media and scanning electrical nanoprobes","sourcePdf":"01576737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073109S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"33328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"33328","articleId":"1576737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1576750,"authors":[{"name":"T. von Buren","affiliation":["Electronics Laboratory, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/33329/1576750/1576750-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas von B\u00fcren received the Dipl.-Ing. degree (M.Eng.) in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2000.

However, under many practical operating conditions, the driving motion will not be sinusoidal. In this paper, we present a comparison of the simulated performance of optimized configurations of the different architectures using measured acceleration data from walking motion gathered from human subjects. The sensitivity of generator performance to variations in generator parameters is investigated, with a 20% change in generator parameters causing between a 3% and 80% drop in generator power output, depending upon generator architecture and operating condition. Based on the results of this investigation, microgenerator design guidelines are provided. The Coulomb-force parametric generator is the recommended architecture for generators with internal displacement amplitude limits of less than /spl sim/0.5 mm and the velocity-damped resonant generator is the recommended architecture when the internal displacement amplitude can exceed /spl sim/0.5 mm, depending upon the exact operating conditions.

The developed system showed high recognition probability to discriminate various single odors to its high generality properties; however, the system had a limitation in recognizing the fragrances mixture. This system also had other disadvantages, such as classifying the unknown category of odor as the known category of odor. In order to improve the performance of the proposed system, development of the sensor and other neural networks (NNs) are being sought. This paper explains the improvement of the capability of that system. In this experiment, the improvement is conducted not only by replacing the last hardware system from four quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies at 10 MHz with new 16 quartz resonator-basic resonance frequencies at 20 MHz, but also by replacing the pattern classifier from BP NNs with the variance of BP, probabilistic NNs, and fuzzy-neuro learning vector quantization (FNLVQ). Matrix similarity analysis (MSA) is then proposed to increase the accuracy of the FNLVQ, to become FNLVQ-MSA neural systems in determining the best exemplar vector, for speeding up its convergence. The purpose of the recent study is to construct a new artificial odor discrimination system for recognizing the fragrance mixtures, in addition to recognizing the unknown fragrance mixtures. The use of new sensing systems and FNLVQ-MSA has produced higher capability, compared to the previously mentioned system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8725798","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576773/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial odor discrimination system using multiple quartz resonator sensors and various neural networks for recognizing fragrance mixtures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial odor discrimination system using multiple quartz resonator sensors and various neural networks for recognizing fragrance mixtures","sourcePdf":"01576773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087175S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"33329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33329","articleId":"1576773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576781,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

This can be exactly and efficiently performed using a message passing scheme such as the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. We present a novel iterative reduced complexity variation of the BCJR algorithm that uses reduced support approximations for the forward and backward messages, as in the M-BCJR algorithm. Forward/backward message computation is based on the concept of expectation propagation, which results in an algorithm similar to the M-BCJR algorithm with the active state selection criterion being changed from the filtered distribution of state variables to beliefs of state variables. By allowing possibly different supports for the forward and backward messages, we derive identical forward and backward recursions that can be iterated. Simulation results of application for trellis-based equalization of a wireless communication system confirm the improved performance over the M-BCJR algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/33330/01576781.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2005.861600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2005.861600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate inference in hidden Markov models using iterative active state selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Iterative algorithms","Message passing","Signal processing algorithms","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Equalizers","Frequency","Transmitting antennas","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference mechanisms","state-space methods","hidden Markov models","deterministic algorithms","message passing","equalisers","computational complexity","probability","approximation theory","trellis codes","iterative decoding","recursive estimation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inference approximation","hidden Markov model","HMM","active state selection iteration","marginal posterior probability","mass function","state space method","message passing scheme","iterative reduced complexity variation","BCJR algorithm","reduced support approximation","forward-backward recursion","expectation propagation","trellis-based equalization","wireless communication system","deterministic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deterministic algorithms","equalizers","hidden Markov models (HMMs)","message passing","state space methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Approximate inference in hidden Markov models using iterative active state selection","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576781/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8716543","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate inference in hidden Markov models using iterative active state selection","sourcePdf":"01576781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076873S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"33330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33330","articleId":"1576781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576783,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Different re-synchronization schemes are considered and compared. This optimal mode selection algorithm is integrated with an efficient channel encoder, a cyclic redundancy check outer coder concatenated with an inner rate-compatible punctured convolutional coder. The system performance is both analyzed and simulated. Last, the framework is extended to operate on a time-varying wireless Internet channel with feedback information from the receiver. Both instantaneous feedback and delayed feedback are evaluated, and an improved method of refined distortion estimation for encoding is presented and simulated for the case of delayed feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video coding with fixed-length packetization for a tandem channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33331/01576801.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Video coding with fixed-length packetization for a tandem channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576801/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731065","pubMedId":"16479798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video coding with fixed-length packetization for a tandem channel","sourcePdf":"01576801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066692S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33331","articleId":"1576801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1576802,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In packet-based communication systems, such as wireless channels or the Internet, packet delivery is not guaranteed. Therefore, from the point-of-view of the transmitter, the distortion at the receiver is a random variable. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on minimizing the expected value of the end-to-end distortion. This paper explores the benefits of accounting for not only the mean, but also the variance of the end-to-end distortion when allocating limited source and channel resources. By accounting for the variance of the distortion, the proposed approach increases the reliability of the system by making it more likely that what the end-user sees, closely resembles the mean end-to-end distortion calculated at the transmitter. Experimental results demonstrate that variance-aware resource allocation can help limit error propagation and is more robust to channel-mismatch than approaches whose goal is to strictly minimize the expected distortion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VAPOR: variance-aware per-pixel optimal resource allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860600","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33331/01576802.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"VAPOR: variance-aware per-pixel optimal resource allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576802/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731066","pubMedId":"16479799","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VAPOR: variance-aware per-pixel optimal resource allocation","sourcePdf":"01576802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078869S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33331","articleId":"1576802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1576804,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

It is shown that the ALV plot consistently peaks at a spatial resolution in which the pixels has a size corresponding to half the distance between scene objects, and that, under very specific conditions, it also peaks at a spatial resolution in which the pixel size corresponds to the whole distance between scene objects. It is argued that the peak at object distance when present is an expression of the Nyquist sample rate. The presence of this peak is, hence, shown to be a function of the matching between the phase of the scene pattern and the phase of the sample grid, i.e., the image. When these phases match, a clear and distinct peak is produced on the ALV plot. The fact that the peak at half the distance consistently occurs in the ALV plot is linked to the circumstance that the sampling interval (distance between pixels) and the extent of the sampling unit (size of pixels) are equal. Hence, at twice the Nyquist sampling rate, each fundamental period of the pattern is covered by four pixels; therefore, at least one pixel is always completely embedded within one pattern element, regardless of sample scene phase. If the objects in the scene are scattered with a distance larger than their extent, the peak will be related to the size by a factor larger than 1/2. This is suggested to be the explanation to the results presented by others that the ALV plot is related to scene-object size by a factor of 1/2-3/4.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33331/01576804.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"318","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fundamentals of average local Variance-part II: sampling simple regular patterns with optical imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","displayDocTitle":"The fundamentals of average local Variance-part II: sampling simple regular patterns with optical imagery","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576804/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731068","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","pubMedId":"16479801","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fundamentals of average local Variance-part II: sampling simple regular patterns with optical imagery","sourcePdf":"01576804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050785S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33331","articleId":"1576804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1576815,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An ideal image quality measure should, therefore, be able to mimic the human observer.

Based on singular value decomposition, it reliably measures the distortion not only within a distortion type at different distortion levels, but also across different distortion types. The measure was applied to five test images (airplane, boat, Goldhill, Lena, and peppers) using six types of distortion (JPEG, JPEG 2000, Gaussian blur, Gaussian noise, sharpening, and DC-shifting), each with five distortion levels. Its performance is compared with PSNR and two recent measures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Image quality","Distortion measurement","Noise measurement","Humans","Singular value decomposition","Testing","Airplanes","Boats","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image denoising","distortion","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grayscale image quality measure","singular value decomposition","distortion type","graphical measure","scalar measure","distortion level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image quality","local error measurement","objective measures","peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)","singular value decomposition (SVD)","subjective evaluation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33331/01576815.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SVD-based grayscale image quality measure for local and global assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An SVD-based grayscale image quality measure for local and global assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576815/","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576815/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8731079","pubMedId":"16479812","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SVD-based grayscale image quality measure for local and global assessment","sourcePdf":"01576815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073574S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"33331","articleId":"1576815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1576816,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a \"reference\" or \"perfect\" image in some perceptual space. Such \"full-reference\" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of \"natural\" images and videos that are meant for \"human consumption.\" Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at the LIVE website.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2006","volume":"15","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8731080","pubMedId":"16479813","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576816/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Image information and visual quality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image information and visual quality","sourcePdf":"01576816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079053S","chronDate":"Feb.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"2014","xplore-issue":"33331","articleId":"1576816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":1576822,"authors":[{"name":"Young Seo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/33331/1576822/1576822-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young Seo Park received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1990, M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, in 2005.","He was a Researcher at Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Suwon, Korea, from 1990 to 1999.

The focus is on designing the least destabilizing quantizer subject to a given information constraint. We explore several ways of measuring the destabilizing effect of a quantizer on the closed-loop system, including (but not limited to) the worst-case quantization error. In each case, we show how quantizer design can be naturally reduced to a version of the so-called multicenter problem from locational optimization.

In particular, an iterative solver is developed for a novel weighted multicenter problem which most accurately represents the least destabilizing quantizer design.

Two new bandwidth enhancement techniques, namely inductive series peaking and current feedback that are specific to low-voltage CMOS current-mode circuits, are introduced. The inductive series peaking technique utilizes the resonant characteristics of LC networks to achieve both a flat frequency response and maximum bandwidth. Current feedback extends bandwidth, lowers input impedance, and improves dynamic range.

However, the size of their recognition vocabulary is small because its extremely high computational costs cause long processing times. To achieve high-speed operations, we developed a VLSI system that has a scalable architecture. The architecture effectively uses parallel computations on the word HMM structure. It can reduce processing time and/or extend the word vocabulary. To explore the practicality of our architecture, we designed and evaluated a complete system recognizer, including speech analysis and noise robustness parts, on a 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS standard cell library and field-programmable gate array. In the CMOS standard-cell implementation, the total processing time is 56.9 /spl mu/s/word at an operating frequency of 80 MHz in a single system. The recognizer gives a real-time response using an 800-word vocabulary.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33334/01576887.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable architecture for word HMM-based speech recognition and VLSI implementation in complete system","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.854408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.854408","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Scalable architecture for word HMM-based speech recognition and VLSI implementation in complete system","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8722432","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576887/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable architecture for word HMM-based speech recognition and VLSI implementation in complete system","sourcePdf":"01576887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056407S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"33334","articleId":"1576887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576889,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.

First, we apply an overlap-and-save (sliding windows with overlapping) strategy that is most suitable for real-time CBSS processing; this approach can also aid in solving the permutation problem. Second, we consider the issue of separating sources in the frequency domain. We introduce a modified correlation matrix of observed signals and perform CBSS by diagonalization of the matrix. Third, we propose a method that can diagonalize the modified correlation matrix by solving a so-called normal equation for CBSS. One desirable feature of our proposed algorithm is that it can solve the CBSS problem explicitly, rather than stochastically, as is done with conventional algorithms. Moreover, a real-time separation of the convolutive mixtures of sources can be performed. We designed several simulations to compare the effectiveness of our algorithm with its counterpart, the gradient-based approach. Our proposed algorithm displayed superior convergence rates relative to the gradient-based approach. We also designed an experiment for testing the efficacy of the algorithm in real-time CBSS processing aimed at separating acoustic sources in realistic environments. Within this experimental context, the convergence time of our algorithms was substantially faster than that of the gradient-based algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm converges to a much lower value of the cost function than that of the gradient-based algorithm, ensuring better performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.854295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33334/01576892.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.854295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A near real-time approach for convolutive blind source separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576892/","displayDocTitle":"A near real-time approach for convolutive blind source separation","volume":"53","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8722436","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576892/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A near real-time approach for convolutive blind source separation","sourcePdf":"01576892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090361S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33334","articleId":"1576892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1576893,"authors":[{"name":"Sanqing Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/33334/1576893/1576893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanqing Hu (M'05) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Hunan Normal University, Hunan, China, the M.S. degree in automatic control from Northeastern University, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 1992, 1996, and 2001, respectively.

Two typical cases are investigated in detail: the hysteresis and saturated multiscroll chaotic attractors. A simple blocking circuit diagram is designed for experimentally verifying 1-D 5/spl sim/11-scroll, 2-D 3/spl times/5/spl sim/11-grid scroll, and 3-D 3/spl times/3/spl times/5/spl sim/11-grid scroll hysteresis chaotic attractors by manipulating the switchers. Moreover, a block circuitry is also designed for physically realizing 1-D 10, 12, 14-scroll, 2-D 10, 12, 14/spl times/10-grid scroll, and 3-D 10/spl times/10/spl times/10-grid scroll saturated chaotic attractors via switching. In addition, one can easily realize chaotic attractors with a desired odd number of scrolls by slightly modifying the corresponding voltage saturated function series of the circuit, to produce for instance a 1-D 13-scroll saturated chaotic attractor. This is the first time in the literature to report an experimental verification of a 1-D 14-scroll, a 2-D 14/spl times/10-grid scroll and a 3-D 10/spl times/10/spl times/10-grid (totally 1000) scroll chaotic attractors. Only the 3-D case is reported in detail for simplicity of presentation. It is well known that hardware implementation of 1-D n-scroll with n/spl ges/10, 2-D n/spl times/m-grid scroll with n,m/spl ges/10, and 3-D n/spl times/m/spl times/l-grid scroll with n,m,l/spl ges/10 chaotic attractors is very difficult technically, signifying the novelty and significance of the achievements reported in this paper. Finally, this circuit design approach provides some principles and guidelines for hardware implementation of chaotic attractors with a multidirectional orientation and with a large number of scrolls, useful for future circuitry design and engineering applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","volume":"53","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8731091","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576895/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of multidirectional multiscroll chaotic attractors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of multidirectional multiscroll chaotic attractors","sourcePdf":"01576895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134901S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"33334","articleId":"1576895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1576896,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Several design examples are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","volume":"53","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"8722441","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576898/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improved design of digital fractional-order differentiators using fractional sample delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved design of digital fractional-order differentiators using fractional sample delay","sourcePdf":"01576898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066568S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"33334","articleId":"1576898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1576915,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Indeed, most radio communication standards employ nonconstant envelope modulation such as in the 802.11 series. Owing to power amplifiers' nonlinearities, distortions on the modulations degrade the overall transmitter performance. As a consequence, linearization methods, such as envelope elimination and restoration, have to be employed. The architecture relies on the transformation of a nonconstant envelope modulation to a constant or switched one. This signal coding enables the efficient amplification of the signal without undergoing power amplifier distortions.

In particular, it is shown that for the Rayleigh fading channel, the spectral efficiency loss due to constant-power waterfilling is at most 0.266 b/s/Hz. Furthermore, the performance bound allows a very-low-complexity, logarithm-free, power-adaptation algorithm to be developed.

However, beamforming has an important side effect as it creates a region, herein referred to as the complementary region, where some users in the network cannot sense the directional signals (beams). We have referred to this as the hidden beam problem in Tarokh et al.. From a physical layer perspective, beamforming reduces cochannel interference (CCI). However, in systems that use medium access-control techniques such as the carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol in wireless local area networks, during a busy period of the channel, the users in the complementary region may wrongly decide that the medium is idle and transmit packets. This may cause CCI, unnecessary retransmissions, subsequent backoff, and increased network latency. We introduced the concept of complementary beamforming (CBF) to address this issue in Tarokh et al.. In this paper, we propose two new methods, called \"subspace complementary beamforming \" (SCBF) and \"complementary superposition beamforming\" (CSBF). The SCBF uses dummy data to ensure a controlled level of received energy in all directions of eigenvectors unused by downlink beamforming. The technique works in multipath fading channels. The approach achieves similar results to those reported in Tarokh et al.. However, it enables the second technique (CSBF) which can also send data content in the complementary beam. This allows passive nodes in the network to receive \"broadcast\" information, while the active nodes are engaged in the exchange of user-specific data. It is shown that CBF effects can be achieved simply by increasing the transmit power of only one of antenna elements when space-division multiple access is not applied. Simulations are provided in order to quantify overall network performance improvements when using CBF, confirming significant throughput and delay performance enhancements.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.861674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33336/01576947.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.861674","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"41","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complementary beamforming: new approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Complementary beamforming: new approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576947/","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576947/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727348","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complementary beamforming: new approaches","sourcePdf":"01576947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074993S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33336","articleId":"1576947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576950,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a continuous-time (asynchronous) analog implementation of iterative decoding, and show that it can be approximated as the application of the well-known successive relaxation (SR) method for solving the fixed-point problem. We observe that SR with the optimal relaxation factor can considerably improve the error-rate performance of iterative decoding for short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, compared with SS. Our simulation results for the application of SR to belief propagation (sum-product) and min-sum algorithms demonstrate improvements of up to about 0.7 dB over the standard SS for randomly constructed LDPC codes. The improvement in performance increases with the maximum number of iterations, and by accordingly reducing the relaxation factor. The asymptotic result, corresponding to an infinite maximum number of iterations and infinitesimal relaxation factor, represents the steady-state performance of analog iterative decoding. This means that under ideal circumstances, continuous-time (asynchronous) analog decoders can outperform their discrete-time (synchronous) digital counterparts by a large margin. Our results also indicate that with the assumption of a truncated Gaussian distribution for the random delays among computational modules, the error-rate performance of the analog decoder, particularly in steady state, is rather independent of the variance of the distribution. The proposed simple model for analog decoding, and the associated performance curves, can be used as an \"ideal analog decoder\" benchmark for performance evaluation of analog decoding circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576950/","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576950/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8727351","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics and performance analysis of analog iterative decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics and performance analysis of analog iterative decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","sourcePdf":"01576950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09191S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"33336","articleId":"1576950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576951,"authors":[{"name":"Zongwang Li","affiliation":["Date Storage Systems Center (DSSC), Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33336/1576951/1576951-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zongwang Li (M'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.

Our main focus is on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) systems, although some of our results apply to single-carrier systems, as well. Prior work has shown that estimates of the channel spatial covariance can be obtained without overhead for both frequency-division duplex (FDD) and time-division duplex (TDD) systems by suitably averaging uplink measurements. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of supplementing this \"free\" covariance feedback with mean feedback, where the latter refers to estimates of the spatial channel realization in each subcarrier. Mean feedback can be obtained using reciprocity for TDD systems, and requires explicit feedback for FDD systems. We first devise strategies for using both covariance and mean feedback, mainly restricting attention to beamforming, which is optimal or near-optimal for many outdoor channels with narrow spatial spread. Second, since mean feedback degrades rapidly with feedback delay for mobile channels, we develop quantitative rules of thumb regarding the accuracy required for the mean feedback to be a useful supplement to the already available, and robust, covariance feedback. Our results validate the following intuition: the accuracy requirements for mean feedback to be useful are more relaxed for channels with larger spatial spread, or for a larger number of transmit elements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time precoding for mean and covariance feedback: application to wideband OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.861665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33336/01576953.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.861665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33336","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Space-time precoding for mean and covariance feedback: application to wideband OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1576953/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727354","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time precoding for mean and covariance feedback: application to wideband OFDM","sourcePdf":"01576953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117361S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33336","articleId":"1576953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1576954,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Many BLAST detectors require more receiver antennas than transmitter antennas. We propose two novel turbo-processing BLAST detectors that can operate in systems with fewer receiver antennas than transmitter antennas. Both detectors are based on the group-detection strategy. The first proposed detector, the reduced-dimension maximum a posteriori (RDMAP) detector uses a dynamically formed group for each bit decision, while the second proposed detector, the group maximum a posteriori (GMAP) uses a static grouping. For both detectors, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision is made using a group of transmitted symbols, and the remaining signal contribution is treated as interference. The interference is characterized as nonzero mean colored-noise source that is whitened before a decision is made. Both proposed detectors are generalizations of the MAP detector and the turbo-processing minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector in Sellathurai and Haykin, and Abe and Matsumoto. An uncoded bit-error rate analysis for an independent Rayleigh fading environment is also presented. Simulated results are presented which show that both the RDMAP and GMAP detectors have a performance improvement over the MMSE detector, especially in systems having an excess number of transmitter antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576954/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8727355","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-dimension MAP turbo-BLAST detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-dimension MAP turbo-BLAST detection","sourcePdf":"01576954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067471S","chronDate":"Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33336","articleId":"1576954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":1576955,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed estimator first converts the received signal to the frequency domain, followed by a frequency deconvolution to remove the convolving chip waveform, and then calculates the code-timing estimate from the output of a narrowband filter with a sweeping center frequency, which is designed to suppress the overall interference in the frequency domain. The proposed estimator is near-far resistant, and can deal with time- and frequency-selective channel fading. It uses only the spreading code of the desired user, and can be adaptively implemented for both code acquisition and tracking. We also derive an unconditional Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound (CRB) that is not conditioned on the fading coefficients or the information symbols. It is a more suitable lower bound than a conditional CRB for blind code-timing estimators which do not assume knowledge of the channel or information symbols.

In the application of state estimators, there is often known model or signal information that is either ignored or dealt with heuristically.

Sensor observations are first quantized into discrete messages, then transmitted to a fusion center where a final estimate is generated. Supposing that the sensors use a universal decentralized quantization/estimation scheme and an uncoded quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) transmission strategy, we determine the optimal quantization and transmit power levels at local sensors so as to minimize the total transmit power, while ensuring a given mean squared error (mse) performance. The proposed power scheduling scheme suggests that the sensors with bad channels or poor observation qualities should decrease their quantization resolutions or simply become inactive in order to save power. For the remaining active sensors, their optimal quantization and transmit power levels are determined jointly by individual channel path losses, local observation noise variance, and the targeted mse performance. Numerical examples show that in inhomogeneous sensing environment, significant energy savings is possible when compared to the uniform quantization strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power scheduling of universal decentralized estimation in sensor networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861898","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576972.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Power scheduling of universal decentralized estimation in sensor networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576972/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731015","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power scheduling of universal decentralized estimation in sensor networks","sourcePdf":"01576972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069025S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":1576973,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanqing Li","affiliation":["Laboratory for Neural Signal Processing, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33337/1576973/1576973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanqing Li was born in Hunan Province, China, in 1966.

The first challenging task of this approach is to estimate precisely the unknown mixing matrix. In this paper, an algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix that can be viewed as an extension of the DUET and the TIFROM methods is first developed. Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed. The second task of the two-stage approach is to estimate the source matrix using a standard linear programming algorithm. Another main contribution of the work described in this paper is the development of a recoverability analysis. After extending the results in , a necessary and sufficient condition for recoverability of a source vector is obtained. Based on this condition and various types of source sparsity, several probability inequalities and probability estimates for the recoverability issue are established. Finally, simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576973.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on sparse representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Source separation","Sparse matrices","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Linear programming","Signal processing","Dictionaries","Independent component analysis","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","signal representation","sparse matrices","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["undetermined blind source separation","sparse representation approach","mixing matrix","clustering algorithms","two-stage approach","linear programming algorithm","recoverability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation (BSS)","probability","recoverability","sparse representation","wavelet packets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on sparse representation","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576973/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731016","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underdetermined blind source separation based on sparse representation","sourcePdf":"01576973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171718S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":1576974,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

It is assumed that the observation mixture is obtained through an unknown memoryless linear mapping of independent and bounded magnitude sources. We further assume an initial adaptive prewhitening of the original observation vector which transforms it into a white vector with the same dimension as the original source vector. Our approach is centered around the basic geometric fact that, under a certain boundedness assumption, the unitary mapping which transforms the whitening output vector into an independent vector has the minimum value of maximum (real component) magnitude output over the ensemble of all output components. Therefore, the related criterion is the minimization of the infinity norm of the real component of the unitary separator's output over all possible output combinations. For the minimization of the corresponding nondifferentiable cost function, we propose the use of subgradient optimization methods to obtain a low complexity iterative adaptive solution. The resulting algorithm is fairly intuitive and simple, and provides a low complexity solution especially to a class of multiuser digital communications problems. We provide examples at the end of this paper to illustrate the performance of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","startPage":"438","endPage":"449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple geometric blind source separation method for bounded magnitude sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple geometric blind source separation method for bounded magnitude sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731017","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576974/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple geometric blind source separation method for bounded magnitude sources","sourcePdf":"01576974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080184S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576976,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We consider transmission of linearly precoded data symbols over a frequency selective block fading multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless channel. To encompass a number of transmission schemes, we study this problem utilizing affine precoding, which is a unified model of linearly precoded data symbols with superimposed training. We focus on Bayesian receivers that estimate both the unknown fading coefficients and the data symbols. The receiver may adopt either of the following strategies to retrieve the data symbols: strategy (i) the receiver obtains joint Bayesian channel and symbol estimates, strategy, (ii) the receiver obtains a Bayesian channel estimate initially and the channel measurement is utilized to estimate the data symbols. For both strategies, we provide lower bounds on the mutual information between the data symbols and their corresponding estimates, and we relate these bounds to the symbol Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrices. In contrast to strategy (ii), for strategy (i) the lower bound does not depend on either the channel estimate or the covariance of the channel estimation error. For strategy (ii) we show that asymptotically (as the size of the transmission block grows) there is no loss of information after the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of Gaussian symbols. We also provide guidelines to design affine precoders that maximize the derived lower bounds under the total average transmit power constraint.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576976.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the effect of receiver estimation error upon channel mutual information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576976/","displayDocTitle":"On the effect of receiver estimation error upon channel mutual information","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576976/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effect of receiver estimation error upon channel mutual information","sourcePdf":"01576976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116719S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576977,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Assuming a common radio channel model with a uniform power delay profile, we derive lower bounds on the maximum mean square error for two types of linear channel estimators: an inverse filter and a linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. In contrast to previous work, the main focus here is on overloaded systems where the total number of multipath channel coefficients of all users is greater than processing gain. We show that the inverse filter bound is attained if and only if each pilot sequence is a perfect root-of-unity sequence. Interestingly, the conventional matched filter achieves the same lower bound if pilot sequences form a complementary periodic sequence set.

This is especially true for radio channels with multiple transmit and receive antennas, i.e., multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper derives a performance bound for MIMO channel prediction. It is assumed that prediction is based upon estimating a model for the channel and then extrapolating that model to predict future values of the channel. A vector formulation of the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound for functions of parameters is used to find a lower bound on the prediction error. Numerical evaluation of this bound shows that substantially longer prediction lengths are possible for MIMO channels than for single antenna channels. An intuitive interpretation of this result is that more of the channel structure is revealed when using multiple antennas at both ends. Finally, the longer prediction lengths for MIMO channels are confirmed by numerical results obtained by implementing a MIMO extension of a single-antenna prediction scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861105","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"520","endPage":"529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A performance bound for prediction of MIMO channels","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576981/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"8731024","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance bound for prediction of MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"01576981.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056516S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576982,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Several studies showed that these network features may be correlated and exhibit a certain degree of memory such as bursty losses and delays. The memory and the statistical dependence between losses and temporal delays suggest that the channel may be well modeled by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with appropriate hidden variables that capture the current state of the network. In this paper, an HMM is proposed that shows excellent performance in modeling typical channel behaviors in a set of real packet links. The system is trained with a modified version of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Hidden-state analysis shows how the state variables characterize channel dynamics. State-sequence estimation is obtained by the use of Viterbi algorithm. Real-time modeling of the channel is the first step to implement adaptive communication strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576982.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint end-to-end loss-delay hidden Markov model for periodic UDP traffic over the Internet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Traffic control","Internet","Transport protocols","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","IP networks","Communication channels","Communication system control","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","hidden Markov models","transport protocols","telecommunication traffic","Internet","telecommunication channels","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end loss-delay hidden Markov model","periodic UDP traffic","Internet","network communication channels","bursty losses","temporal delays","expectation-maximization algorithm","hidden-state analysis","state-sequence estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov models (HMM)","loss-and-delay analysis","network models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint end-to-end loss-delay hidden Markov model for periodic UDP traffic over the Internet","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576982/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731025","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint end-to-end loss-delay hidden Markov model for periodic UDP traffic over the Internet","sourcePdf":"01576982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087876S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576983,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Yu","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33337/1576983/1576983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Yu (M'04) received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, P.R.

Optimal linear-programming-based algorithms are presented that take into account of SIR outage probability constraints. By exploiting the MMPP traffic models and introducing a small SIR outage probability, the proposed algorithms can dramatically improve the network utilization.

We focus on the scenario that each sensor observes a single random variable and transmits it using certain signaling in a shared channel. The objective is the design of channel waveforms (i.e., the signal constellation) to facilitate the estimation of field parameters from the channel output. We propose a communication scheme in which sensors transmit according to the type of their observations-type-based multiple access (TBMA)-and show that the TBMA is asymptotically optimal in the limit of large number of sensors if the sensor channel-gains are identical. In particular, we show that TBMA together with a variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao bound asymptotically. We then extend the asymptotic analysis of TBMA to fading channels and compare the performance of TBMA with other orthogonal allocation methods such as time-division multiple access.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576988.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type based estimation over multiaccess channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576988/","displayDocTitle":"Type based estimation over multiaccess channels","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731031","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576988/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type based estimation over multiaccess channels","sourcePdf":"01576988.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09515S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576989,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

This issue requires the knowledge of the optimal performance for a given structure, which is unknown for real mixtures. Herein, the authors introduce an experimental upper bound on the separation performance for a class of convolutive blind source separation structures, which can be used to approximate the optimal performance. As opposed to a theoretical upper bound, the experimental upper bound produces an estimate of the optimal separating parameters for each dataset in addition to specifying an upper bound on separation performance. Estimation of the upper bound involves the application of a supervised learning method to the set of observations found by recording the sources one at a time. Using the upper bound, it is demonstrated that structures other than the finite-impulse-response (FIR) structure should be considered for real (convolutive) mixtures, there is still much room for improvement in current convolutive BSS algorithms, and the separation performance of these algorithms is not necessarily limited by local minima.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861766","endPage":"635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576989.pdf","startPage":"627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental upper bound for the performance of convolutive source separation methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576989/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental upper bound for the performance of convolutive source separation methods","volume":"54","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"8731032","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576989/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental upper bound for the performance of convolutive source separation methods","sourcePdf":"01576989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107507S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1576992,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Algorithms suitable for single-channel and for multichannel active noise controllers are treated within a unified framework. Very mild assumptions are posed on the active noise control system model, which is only required to have a linear dependence of the output from the filter coefficients. Therefore, the analysis applies not only to the linear finite impulse response models but also to nonlinear Volterra filters, i.e., polynomial filters, and other nonlinear filter structures. The convergence analysis presented in this paper relies on energy conservation arguments and does not apply the independence theory, nor does it impose any restriction to the signal distributions. It is shown in the paper that filtered-x affine projection algorithms always provide a biased estimate of the minimum mean square solution. Nevertheless, in many cases, the bias is small and therefore these algorithms can be profitably applied to active noise control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576992.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient and steady-state analysis of filtered-x affine projection algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Steady-state","Algorithm design and analysis","Projection algorithms","Nonlinear filters","Active noise reduction","Finite impulse response filter","Control system synthesis","Polynomials","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient analysis","filtering theory","affine transforms","telecommunication channels","convergence","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient analysis","steady-state analysis","filtered-x affine projection algorithms","single-channel active noise controllers","multichannel active noise controllers","active noise control system model","linear finite impulse response models","nonlinear Volterra filters","convergence analysis","minimum mean square methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active noise control","affine projection algorithm","multichannel adaptive filtering","steady-state analysis","transient analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"Transient and steady-state analysis of filtered-x affine projection algorithms","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576992/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731035","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient and steady-state analysis of filtered-x affine projection algorithms","sourcePdf":"01576992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116586S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576995,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In such systems, MIMO decision feedback equalization (DFE) schemes are often used to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI) resulting from channel multipath propagation. In this context, the existing computationally efficient methods for exact estimation of the DFE filters under minimum mean-square-error criteria (MMSE-DFE) rely on fast Cholesky decomposition and backsubstitution or Levinson techniques. These methods may still present several difficulties in implementation as the demand on higher transmission rates increases, and thus a simple solution is necessary. In this paper, new procedures for fast computation of the MIMO-MMSE-DFE are presented. The new algorithms are obtained from a simple observation, namely, that the optimal feedforward filter (FFF) is related to the well-known Kalman gain matrix, commonly encountered in fast recursive least squares adaptive algorithms-for which fast recursions exist and are readily applicable. Moreover, the feedback filter can be easily computed via stable fast MIMO convolution techniques. As a result, the proposed method is less complex, more structured, and can be as reliable in finite precision as known approaches in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","startPage":"701","endPage":"711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast techniques for computing finite-length MIMO MMSE decision feedback equalizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast techniques for computing finite-length MIMO MMSE decision feedback equalizers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731038","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1576995/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast techniques for computing finite-length MIMO MMSE decision feedback equalizers","sourcePdf":"01576995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080857S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1576996,"authors":[{"name":"Youming Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/33337/1576996/1576996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youming Li received the B.S. degree in computational mathematics from Lan Zhou University, Lan Zhou, China, in 1985, the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, China.","From 1988 to 1998, he was with the Department of Applied Mathematics, Xidian University, where he was an Associate Professor.

In practice, the system should be properly calibrated before DOA estimation. In this paper, a calibration method of gain and phase errors of linear equispaced arrays (LEAs) is considered. A class of simplified calibration algorithms based on different diagonal lines of the covariance matrix is proposed. The statistical performance analyses of the calibration algorithms due to finite data perturbations are presented. Expressions for average bias (Abias) and square root of average variance (SRAV) of the calibration algorithms are derived using first-order approximation. These statistical and computer simulation results reveal and explain why the more diagonal lines that are used for gain and phase error estimations, the more inferior performance that may be obtained. Based on this conclusion, the simple and optimal gain and phase error calibration algorithms for such model are obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analyses of gain and phase error calibration with optimal implementation for linear equispaced array","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576996.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analyses of gain and phase error calibration with optimal implementation for linear equispaced array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576996/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analyses of gain and phase error calibration with optimal implementation for linear equispaced array","sourcePdf":"01576996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05945S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576997,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This paper addresses the problem of ML OSTBC detection with unknown CSI. Focusing on the binary and quaternary PSK constellations, we show that blind ML OSTBC detection can be simplified to a Boolean quadratic program (BQP). From an optimization viewpoint the BQP is still a computationally hard problem, and we propose two alternatives for dealing with this inherent complexity. First, we consider the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach, which leads to a suboptimal, but accurate, blind ML detection algorithm with an affordable worst-case computational cost. We also consider the sphere decoding approach, which leads to an exact blind ML detection algorithm that remains computationally expensive in the worst case, but generally incurs a reasonable average computational cost. For the two algorithms, we study implementation methods that can significantly reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results indicate that the two blind ML detection algorithms are competitive, in that the bit error performance of the two algorithms is almost the same and is noticeably better than that of some other existing blind detectors. Moreover, numerical studies show that the SDR algorithm provides better complexity performance than the sphere decoder in the worst-case sense, and vice versa in the average sense.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576998.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block codes: efficient high-performance implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576998/","displayDocTitle":"Blind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block codes: efficient high-performance implementations","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731041","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1576998/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind ML detection of orthogonal space-time block codes: efficient high-performance implementations","sourcePdf":"01576998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083922S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1576999,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

A periodic (nonrandom) training sequence is arithmetically added (superimposed) at a low power to the information sequence at the transmitter before modulation and transmission. In particular, in , the channel is estimated using only the first-order statistics of the data under a fixed power allocation to training and under the assumption that the superimposed training sequence at the receiver is time-synchronized with its transmitted counterpart (frame synchronization). In this paper, we remove these restrictions. We first present a performance analysis of the approach of to obtain a closed-form expression for the channel estimation variance. We then address the issue of superimposed training power allocation for complex Gaussian random (Rayleigh) channels. Using the developed channel estimation variance expression, we cast the power allocation problem as one of optimizing a signal-to-noise ratio for equalizer design. Finally, we propose a novel approach for frame synchronization. All the results are illustrated via simulation examples involving frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Simulation comparisons with an existing approach to frame synchronization is also provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01576999.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1576999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On superimposed training for channel estimation: performance analysis, training power allocation, and frame synchronization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Performance analysis","Frequency synchronization","Transmitters","Statistics","Closed-form solution","Design optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Equalizers","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","synchronisation","time-varying channels","Rayleigh channels","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed training","channel estimation","power allocation","frame synchronization","single-input multiple-output time-invariant channels","periodic training sequence","first-order statistics","closed-form expression","Rayleigh channels","Gaussian random channels","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel equalization","channel estimation performance analysis","frame synchronization","intersymbol interference (ISI) channels","superimposed training","training power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1576999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"On superimposed training for channel estimation: performance analysis, training power allocation, and frame synchronization","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1576999/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731042","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On superimposed training for channel estimation: performance analysis, training power allocation, and frame synchronization","sourcePdf":"01576999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101754S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1576999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1577000,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

Research has shown that feedback can be used to increase achievable data rates and add resilience against fading. Most of the work to this point, however, has ignored the data rate overhead associated with feedback. Models that do not consider feedback overhead are valid in wireless systems with ever present control channels, but they fail to capture the data rate cost of feedback when control channels are not present. In this paper, we present a new system model, called a duplex model, that captures the true loss (or cost) of feedback. A new distortion function for use with codebook design follows from the duplex system model. This system model is used to derive bounds on the amount of feedback needed under different antenna, signal-to-noise ratio, and bandwidth assumptions. Simulation results show the necessity of taking feedback into account.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.861793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/33337/01577000.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2005.861793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duplex distortion models for limited feedback MIMO communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1577000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577000/","displayDocTitle":"Duplex distortion models for limited feedback MIMO communication","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2006","accessionNumber":"8731043","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1577000/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duplex distortion models for limited feedback MIMO communication","sourcePdf":"01577000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086051S","chronDate":"Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"33337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33337","articleId":"1577000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1577003,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jun Fang","id":"37272213800"},{"name":"A.R.

Timely updating the channel state is an obvious solution to improve the system performance in a time varying channel. However, a better knowledge of the channel comes at the cost of a decrease in the system throughput. Thus, predicting the future channel conditions can improve not only the performance but also the throughput of many types of wireless systems. This is especially true for a wireless system where multiple antennas are applied at both link ends. In this paper we propose and evaluate the performance of a prediction scheme for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems that apply spatial multiplexing. We aim at predicting the future precoder/decoder directly without going through the prediction of the channel matrix.

The SOFM is an unsupervised-competitive neural network that can learn a topology-preserving mapping from a high dimensional input space to a lower dimensional map lattice. The SOFM was trained using two-dimensional theoretical magnetic signatures of an equivalent UXO dipole source in different X, Y, and Z coordinates. The feature map is designed as a three-dimensional SOFM, where each dimension in this feature map is used to detect one coordinate of the UXO position. The experimental results showed that the SOFM could accurately recognize the UXO position from both simulated magnetic anomaly data and actual airborne magnetic field data. The network could also recognize the UXO position correctly when tested with noisy magnetic anomaly data up to +/-15%.

However, bit error rate (BER) performance of OFDM deteriorates significantly in time-varying channels due to presence of inter-channel interference (ICI). Previous works proposed time or frequency domain equalizers to reduce the effect of ICI. In this paper, we consider a combination of equalization and interference cancellation techniques to obtain better BER performance of OFDM in time-varying channels.

As the analogous effects of these three pathological factors in changing the regular pattern of glottal opening and closure, influencing the speech signal quality, leads to a group of highly correlated extracted feature vectors, NN and SVM as nonlinear classifiers are used to achieve the best result in classification percentage. Besides, these powerful classifiers are supported with a genetic-based optimization algorithm to find the best and least correlated features which comprises their maximum final performance. Experiments on the basis of two different methods of feature extraction, wavelet packet sub-bands and Mel frequency scaled filter-banks, are carried out with some voiced signal.

The proposed system filters upon inexplicability scores, on the grounds that those trajectories which we can explain in terms of simple goals are exactly those trajectories which are uninteresting: it is only those we cannot simply explain which are worth attending to.

Now, the motion estimation problem is ill posed. This fact is known as the aperture problem: trajectories are ambiguous since they could coincide with any promenade in the space-time isophote surface. In this paper, we try to show that, for denoising, the aperture problem can be taken advantage of. Indeed, by the aperture problem, many pixels in the neighboring frames are similar to the current pixel one wishes to denoise. Thus, denoising by an averaging process can use many more pixels than just the ones on a single trajectory. This observation leads to use for movies a recently introduced image denoising method, the NL-means algorithm. This static 3D algorithm outperforms motion compensated algorithms, as it does not lose movie details. It involves the whole movie isophote and not just a trajectory.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2005.1577245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10535/33340/01577245.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2005.1577245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising image sequences does not require motion estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1577245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577245/","displayDocTitle":"Denoising image sequences does not require motion estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8874141","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1577245/","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising image sequences does not require motion estimation","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"01577245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043432S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10535","isNumber":"33340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10535","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"33340","articleId":"1577245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1577271,"authors":[{"name":"V.D.

These are reminiscent of the minutia points produced in fingerprint recognition techniques. During the classification stage, local and global structures of TMPs extracted from test images are matched with those of database images.

A particular case of DVC, Wyner-Ziv coding, deals with lossy source coding with side information at the decoder and allows a shift of complexity from the encoder to the decoder, theoretically without any penalty in the coding efficiency. The Wyner-Ziv solution here described encodes each video frame independently (intraframe coding), but decodes the same frame conditionally (interframe decoding). At the decoder, and compensation tools are responsible to obtain an accurate interpolation of the original frame using previously decoded (temporally adjacent) frames. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of pixel domain Wyner-Ziv video coding by using a motion compensated refinement of the decoded frame and use it as improved side information. More precisely, upon partial decoding of each frame, the decoder refines its motion trajectories in order to achieve a better reconstruction of the decoded frame.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2005.1577335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10535/33340/01577335.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2005.1577335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensated refinement for low complexity pixel based distributed video coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1577335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577335/","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensated refinement for low complexity pixel based distributed video coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8902071","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1577335/","conferenceDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensated refinement for low complexity pixel based distributed video coding","confLoc":"Como, Italy","sourcePdf":"01577335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06038S","chronDate":"15-16 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10535","isNumber":"33340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10535","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"33340","articleId":"1577335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1577351,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chi Lee","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yen-Chi Lee","id":"37281121900"},{"name":"Ming-Chang Tsai","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Chang Tsai","id":"38314351600"},{"name":"K.

The proposed method requires collaboration of the video decoder and multiplexing protocol. In particular, it considers loss characteristics of WCDMA channels and modifies demultiplexer to provide additional information to assist video decoder to locate the error position. Then, the video decoder performs error concealment only on the lost macroblocks (MBs), instead of all the MBs in a video slice. The simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the number of concealed MBs by 22-27% and improve video quality by 0.3-0.7 dB, depending on the video contents and block error rates.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577351","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Here, we study CMT performance when a sender is constrained by the rbuf. We demonstrate using simulation that if two paths are used for CMT, the lower quality (i.e., higher loss rate) path degrades overall throughput of an rbuf-constrained CMT association by blocking the rbuf. We demonstrate that a wise retransmission policy can alleviate some of the throughput degradation by reducing the rbuf blocking problem. We present and discuss CMT performance using several retransmission policies and constrained rbuf values of 16 KB, 32 KB, 64 KB, 128 KB, and 256 KB. While rbuf blocking cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by choice of retransmission policy - a facility available to only the transport layer.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577365","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Real constrained linear detectors and decision feedback detectors are proposed for real constellations by forcing the relaxed solution to be real. Generalized minimum mean-square error and constrained least squares detectors are generalized as MIMO detectors for both constant and non-constant modulus constellations. Using our constrained linear detectors, we propose a new ordering scheme to achieve a tradeoff between interference suppression and noise enhancement. Moreover, we introduce a combined constrained linear and decision feedback detector to mitigate the error propagation in decision feedback. Simulation results show that the combined detectors achieve significant performance gain over V-BLAST detection.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577380","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

This technique can be applied to both pure OFDM and OFDM based multiple-access systems to improve spectral efficiency. Moreover, it can be utilized within OFDM based overlay systems to avoid interference towards the legacy systems operating in the same frequency band as the overlay system. The proposed sidelobe suppression technique is based on subcarrier weighting. The real-valued subcarrier weights are determined in such a way that the sidelobes of the transmission signal are minimized using an optimization algorithm which is capable to take several optimization constraints into account. Results show that sidelobes can be easily suppressed by more than 10 dB with the proposed technique. These results are achieved by allowing only a moderate loss in bit-error rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577381","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Hot carriers (HCs), found in the CMOS-based synchronization circuits, are high-mobility charge carriers that affect the MOSFETs' stability by increasing the required operating threshold voltages. The HC effect manifests itself as the phase noise, which increases with the continued MOSFET operation and results in the performance degradation of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) built on the MOSFETs. The MOSFET instability impacts on the OFDM system performance, by inducing intercarrier interference (ICI) and common phase error (CPE) on the subcarriers. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of ICI self-cancellation coding on the phase noise induced by the hot-carrier effect in OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577464","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Furthermore, it is known that in practice, VCSELs tend to operate in several transverse modes simultaneously. This will cause even more increase in the interchannel and intersymbol interference, to our knowledge this issue has been neglected so far.

If two strong pumps and a weak signal are fed into a fiber, an idler is generated. Signal and idler can grow together if pump power is high enough, and phase matching occurs. In recent years, impressive performance has been demonstrated in several respects: 1) Gain in excess of 60 dB has been obtained; 2) fiber OPAs can exhibit a large variety of gain spectra: a gain bandwidth of 400 nm has been demonstrated; tunable narrowband gain regions can also be generated; 3) Noise figure of 3.7 dB, limited by other third-order nonlinear process; 4) Polarization-insensitive operation in both one-pump and two-pump configurations; 5) The presence of the idler can be used for wavelength conversion. Also, the spectrum of the idler is inverted with respect to that of the signal; thus by placing an OPA in the middle of a fiber span one can realize mid-span spectral inversion (MSSI) which counteracts the effect of fiber dispersion and some nonlinear effects. Besides using fiber OPA in continuous-wave regime as in typical systems, pulsed-pump has also been demonstrated to achieve larger bandwidth and higher peak gain by combining with optical filtering technique. Furthermore, by modulating the pump it is possible to modulate signal and/or idler at the output. This can be used to implement a variety of signal processing functions, including: fast signal switching; demultiplexing of time-division-multiplexed signals; retiming and reshaping of waveforms; optical sampling. A number of challenges must be overcome in order for fiber OPAs to be useful in communication applications. In multi-wavelength systems, these are: four-wave mixing, cross-phase modulation; and cross-gain modulation between signals. Furthermore, the pump-to-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer and frequency/phase modulation (FM/PM) to signal intensity conversion are also potential challenges for practical fiber OPAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Optical fibers","Stimulated emission","Optical fiber amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical fiber polarization","Optical signal processing","Optical wavelength conversion","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demultiplexing","glass fibres","laser tuning","multiwave mixing","nonlinear optical susceptibility","optical communication equipment","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical modulation","optical parametric amplifiers","optical phase matching","optical pumping","optical wavelength conversion","phase modulation","signal sampling","spectral line narrowing","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber amplifiers","optical parametric amplifiers","third-order nonlinear susceptibility","glass fibers","optical pumps","phase matching","gain spectra","gain bandwidth","tunable gain regions","narrowband gain regions","noise figure","third-order nonlinear process","polarization-insensitive operation","one-pump configuration","two-pump configuration","gain regions","wavelength conversion","mid-span spectral inversion","fiber dispersion","nonlinear effects","continuous-wave regime","pulsed-pump","optical filtering","pump modulation","signal modulation","signal processing functions","fast signal switching","demultiplexing","time-division-multiplexed signals","waveform retiming","waveform reshaping","optical sampling","multiwavelength systems","four-wave mixing","cross-phase modulation","cross-gain modulation","pump-to-signal relative intensity noise","frequency modulation","phase modulation","signal intensity conversion","3.7 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical amplifier","parametric amplification","wavelengthconversion","optical communication","optical fibers","nonlinearoptics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMMAD.2004.1577576","publicationTitle":"Conference on Optoelectronic and Microelectronic Materials and Devices, 2004.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference on Optoelectronic and Microelectronic Materials and Devices, 2004.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10540/33345/01577576.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMMAD.2004.1577576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent Advances in the Design and Implementation of Practical Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1577576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recent Advances in the Design and Implementation of Practical Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577576/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1577576/","accessionNumber":"9108600","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent Advances in the Design and Implementation of Practical Fiber Optical Parametric Amplifiers","confLoc":"Brisbane, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"01577576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055802S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10540","isNumber":"33345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10540","xplore-issue":"33345","articleId":"1577576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1577642,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We assume that the service provider offers two distinct grades of service (GoS) to which users may subscribe: premium, or economy. Subscribers to the premium service receive higher quality levels measured by a set of parameters such as coding rate and format. The proposed algorithm guarantees that all users receive their contractual level of quality while maximizing the radio links' throughput, and maintaining the QoS requirements (e.g., target B.E.R, maximum transfer delay, and percentage of packets lost or delayed) for each media stream (e.g., voice, video, and data) downloaded to the users. Multimedia adaptation filters are installed at the output ports of the radio network controller. Simulation results show significant improvement in terms of increasing the number of admitted users while reducing the percentage of packets lost or delayed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33285","startPage":"5 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The performance analysis of this new scheme has been presented by comparing with on-off keying (OOK) formats with memory and the HHH(1,13) code proposed and specified in the Very Fast Infrared (VFIr) standard by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), but operating under a rate-adaptive transmission environment. The superiority of the block coding method has been corroborated, being the improvement in performance higher as the length of the data block is increased. Additionally, the use of very simple decoding schemes based on ML detection has been proposed as alternative to the procedure based on the Viterbi algorithm.

The detector is based on the well-known pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) representation of continuous phase modulation (CPM). Since SOQPSK is a ternary CPM, we show how the binary-based PAM technique is extended to accommodate the ternary case. We demonstrate that a detector based on the first two PAM components requires a simple trellis of only 4 states. We show that near-optimum performance is achieved using this reduced-complexity detector. The potential complexity reduction can be quite large, since one version of SOQPSK requires a trellis of 512 states.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577659","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The interplay of the end-to-end design of IP and the vested interests of competing stakeholders has led to its growing ossification. Alterations to the Internet architecture that address its fundamental deficiencies or enable new services have been restricted to incremental changes. The slow pace of this process stifles innovation and the adoption of disruptive technology. A recent call to arms advances a research agenda to confront this impasse through virtualization (L. Peterson et al., 2004). In addition to describing a virtual testbed for the evaluation of new network architectures, it poses a question about the long-term role of virtualization in the Internet. The architectural \"purist\" views virtualization as a tool for architecture evaluation and the periodic deployment of successive, singular Internet architectures. In this paper, we advance the \"pluralist\" view that seeks to make virtualization an architectural attribute of the Internet. By enabling a plurality of diverse network architectures to coexist on a shared physical substrate, virtualization mitigates the ossifying forces at work in the current Internet and enables continual introduction of innovative network technologies. Such a diversified Internet would allow existing architectural deficiencies to be holistically addressed as well as enable the introduction of new architectures supporting new types of applications and services. We provide a detailed exposition of the diversified Internet concept, explain how it can address the problem of network ossification and discuss some of the technical challenges that must be met to turn the vision into reality","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577741","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Network elements can be connected to each other by a powerful graphical interface. Subsequently the user can select network parameters to be optimized in order to achieve prearranged QoS guarantees.

The codes are optimized by performing curve fitting on EXIT charts. This technique is developed for binary erasure channels based on area property and is extended to other channels. We show that on channels where the area property is not valid, the curve fitting approach is a sub-optimal method of optimizing for the best convergence threshold. On Gaussian channels, the messages from variable nodes to check nodes are approximated by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. We prove that the check node detector mutual information transfer function derived using this approximation is an upper bound. So the EXIT chart analysis predicts an optimistic value for the convergence threshold. We give an empirical lower bound for the check node detector mutual information transfer function. For few irregular LDPC codes designed for AWGN channel using density evolution, we have examined the accuracy of convergence thresholds predicted by EXIT charts using these bounds for the check node transfer function. The analysis of EXIT chart technique presented in this paper can be extended to other channels for which the distribution of channel messages can be approximated by a symmetric Gaussian/Gaussian mixture distribution.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577830","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The Tanner graph of a generalized polygon LDPC code is highly symmetric, inherits the diameter size of the parent generalized polygon, and has minimum (one half) diameter-to-girth ratio. We show formally that when the diameter is four or six or eight all codewords have even Hamming weight. When the generalized polygon has in addition equal number of points and lines, we see that the non-regular polygon based code construction has minimum distance that is higher at least by two in comparison with the dual regular polygon code of the same rate and length. A new minimum distance bound is presented for codes from non-regular polygons of even diameter and equal number of points and lines. Finally, we prove that all codes derived from finite classical generalized quadrangles are quasi-cyclic and we give the explicit size of the circulant blocks in the parity check matrix. Our simulation studies of several generalized polygon LDPC codes demonstrate powerful bit-error-rate performance when decoding is carried out via low complexity variants of belief propagation.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

A universal LDPC code is defined as a code with the same performance over a class of channels, in which the performance is measured by the threshold of the code in terms of mutual information (in bits/sec/Hz). The receiver proposed in this paper decomposes the fading channel into a bank of memoryless sub-channels. Each sub-channel is encoded with a LDPC code. An MMSE estimator followed by a LDPC decoder is used to successively decodes the channel code. With this scheme, we show that LDPC codes have the universal performance on fading channels with variant fading rates. We also prove that the LDPC code design is unified. Hence, the optimal LDPC codes for the perfect CSI receiver is also optimal for correlated fading channels without CSI.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577832","startPage":"5 pp.","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Minimum distance is shown to grow linearly with block size (similar to regular codes of variable degree at least 3) by considering ensemble average weight enumerators. Our constructions are based on projected graph, or protograph, structures that support high-speed decoder implementations. As with irregular ensembles, our constructions are sensitive to the proportion of degree-2 variable nodes. A code with too few such nodes tends to have an iterative decoding threshold that is far from the capacity threshold. A code with too many such nodes tends to not exhibit a minimum distance that grows linearly in block length. In this paper we also show that preceding can be used to lower the threshold of regular LDPC codes. The decoding thresholds of the proposed codes, which have linearly increasing minimum distance in block size, outperform that of regular LDPC codes. Furthermore, a family of low to high rate codes, with thresholds that adhere closely to their respective channel capacity thresholds, is presented. Simulation results for a few example codes show that the proposed codes have low error floors as well as good threshold SNR performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577834/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8946326","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1577834/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Protograph based LDPC codes with minimum distance linearly growing with block size","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protograph based LDPC codes with minimum distance linearly growing with block size","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01577834.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154661S","chronDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"33287","articleId":"1577834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1577837,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.K.

However, most of these schemes ignore the quality of the source-relay (S-R) channel in the decoding process, even though it is this channel that limits the performance of cooperation schemes. This paper introduces a simple yet robust scheme for cooperative diversity based on message passing in the decoding process, which accounts for the quality of the S-R channel. In our scheme, the relay decodes the source symbols and forms parity bits, which are in turn used by the destination (D) to decode the source message. By accounting for the reliability of the parity bits, performance measures, such as bit error rate, are not limited by the S-R channel quality and improve with increasing signal-to-noise ratio on the S-D and R-D channels. With our scheme, feedback signals to the source node are not required, with only simple decoding and encoding required at the relay.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Message passing","Intelligent networks","Wireless sensor networks","Relays","Decoding","Feedback","Charge coupled devices","Military computing","Strontium","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","message passing","wireless sensor networks","fading channels","error statistics","channel coding","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative diversity schemes","message passing","wireless sensor networks","block fading channels","source-relay channel quality","decoding process","parity bits reliability","bit error rate","signal-to-noise ratio","feedback signals"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577837","startPage":"5 pp.","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

In the past, various structures of single code-rate LDPC decoders have been reported. However, to cover a wide range of service requirements and diverse interference conditions in wireless applications, LDPC decoders that can operate at both high and low code rates are desirable. In this paper, a 9k code length multi-rate LDPC decoder architecture is presented and implemented on a Xilinx FPGA device. Using pin selection, three operating modes, namely, the irregular 1/2 code, the regular 5/8 code and the regular 7/8 code, are supported. Furthermore, to suppress the error floor level, a characterization on the conditions for short cycles in a LDPC code matrix expanded from a small base matrix is presented, and a cycle elimination algorithm is developed to detect and break such short cycles. The effectiveness of the cycle elimination algorithm has been verified by both simulation and hardware measurements, which show that the error floor is suppressed to a much lower level without incurring any performance penalty.

In this paper, we present an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of the zero-forcing receiver operating in the multiuser MIMO system with scalar feedback scheduling. Using the order statistics technique, we derive closed-form expressions for the achievable throughput of the zero-forcing receiver operating in the multiuser MIMO environment.

In the new IMAP-TPC scheme, TPC decoding is integrated with a symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector. The MAP detector calculates the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of a received symbol using the estimated conditional pdfs, and hence, obtains a much more accurate reliability measure for use in the TPC decoder. Similar to the case in the recent hardware implementation of TPC decoder for optical systems, we generate TPC by serial concatenation of two Bose, Chaudhuri, and Hocquenghem codes with low overhead.

Due to the limitations of the channel characteristics of Category 6 (CAT-6) unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, capacity of the channel is only slightly above the proposed 10 Gbps data rate. This poses a great challenge to the design of equalizers. This paper addresses the problem of designing a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) maximal shortening equalizer with decision feedback cancellation. Unlike traditional approaches such as the decision feedback equalizers (DFEs), the shortening equalizer optimally focuses the channel impulse response to a small number of taps. If a subsequent maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) equalizer is used, the performance loss caused by symbol-by-symbol hard decision of traditional equalizers can be reduced. However, due to the complexity involved in the shortening equalizers is generally prohibitive; it is difficult to apply them to systems using modulation with large constellations. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an equalizer that combines DFE and the shortening equalizer. Thus, with acceptable complexity, the shortened signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) can be significantly improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1577870/","accessionNumber":"8946361","displayDocTitle":"An MMSE maximal shortening equalizer for 10GBASE-T Ether networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MMSE maximal shortening equalizer for 10GBASE-T Ether networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO","sourcePdf":"01577870.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07889S","chronDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33287","articleId":"1577870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1577872,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Accounting for non-identical interferers avoids the loose spectral efficiency bounds in the literature that only look at the worst case and best case locations of identical co-channel interferers. It also enables including the effect of second-tier interferers in the cellular layout, and leads to analytical results that are in excellent agreement with the simulation results.

In this method, the message is encoded using a turbo code. Then the parities are heavily punctured using an iterative process and all non-punctured parities along with side information are sent to the decoder. To improve the performance, a single code can be replaced by a library of codes. The message is compressed using each code and the best result is sent to the decoder. The side information contains the number of punctured parities and the index of the applied code. Instead of transmitting the code index, we find a criterion to detect the code index using the transmitted parities, at the decoder.

The EI on parity bits can not be utilized during iterative decoding. In this paper, we propose a new type of iterative decoding scheme mapping parity bits of turbo codes to a multi-dimensional (MD) QPSK, which makes it possible to utilize the EI on parity bits by iterative demapping. We use extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart to predict the system's convergence behavior and to help search good RSC codes and MD QPSK schemes. An analytical upper bound is also given to show the system's asymptotic performance in medium to high E/sub b//N/sub 0/ region. We introduce two special schemes and do simulations on them. Particularly, the scheme with turbo code consisting of two 4-state (7, 6) codes and an eight dimensional QPSK outperforms Berrou turbo code with two 16-state RSC codes in water fall region and has similar error floor.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577882","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The unique contribution is the derivation of a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results are only valid for either p = 1 or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on the volume formula, the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds for sphere packings are obtained. Assuming a uniformly distributed source and a distortion metric based on the squared chordal distance, tight lower and upper bounds are established for the distortion rate tradeoff. Simulation results match the derived results. As an application of the derived quantization bounds, the information rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with finite-rate channel-state feedback is accurately quantified for arbitrary finite number of antennas, while previous results are only valid for either multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems or those with asymptotically large number of transmit antennas but fixed number of receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The target data rate at each SNR is proportional to the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an array gain. The proportionality constant, which can be interpreted as a finite-SNR spatial multiplexing gain, dictates the sensitivity of the rate adaptation policy to SNR. The diversity gain as a function of SNR for a fixed multiplexing gain is defined by the negative slope of the outage probability versus SNR curve. The finite-SNR diversity gain provides an estimate of the additional power required to decrease the outage probability by a target amount. A lower bound on the outage probability of the MIMO system is used to characterize the diversity performance. It is seen that the achievable diversity gains at finite SNRs are significantly lower than asymptotic values given in the literature. This diversity characterization is useful in determining suitable rate adaptation strategies at realistic SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577893","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

These dispersive covariance codes (DCCs) utilize the linear construction of linear dispersion codes (LDCs) to spread information-bearing symbols in the time and spatial domains. It is shown that the linear framework permits the design of capacity optimal codes with desirable performance properties. Since DCCs utilize only statistical channel information instead of instantaneous estimates, feedback overhead is low, and the simple linear encoder simplifies codebook characterization. The DCCs are constructed to satisfy a capacity optimality criterion in conjunction with a pairwise error probability (PEP) constraint to improve error performance. Through numerical simulation, a two-stage DCC design procedure is shown to utilize statistical channel knowledge to provide significantly improved capacity and bit error rate performance over LDC codes in the presence of channel correlations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577894","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

In this paper, we study a cellular network with a t-antenna basestation and K r-antenna users. We assume exponentially correlated fading exists either at the basestation or at the users, and the channels of different users change independently. Multiuser diversity is exploited by always allowing the basestation to transmit to the user which channel provides the highest capacity among all users. For this network, we investigate the impact of correlated fading on the network capacity. We find that if both t and r > 1, the impact of correlated fading depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the low SNR regime, the capacity will also increase with the correlation coefficient. However, at the high SNR regime, under the condition that one side of the channel having correlated fading has less antennas than the other side, the increase of the correlation coefficient will reduce the capacity. In addition, we find the closed-form solutions for the mean and variance of single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel capacities for different cases.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577895","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We show that while our approach using IDFT does not disturb the diversity gains of the MIMO-OFDM systems (spatial, temporal and frequency diversity gains), it offers a better trade-off between PAPR reduction and ML decoding complexity compared to that of the Hadamard transform precoding.

Pilot-symbol-aided or decision-directed channel estimation must be used to track channel variations in MIMO-OFDM systems. While pilot symbols facilitate channel estimation, they reduce the transmit energy for data symbols under a fixed total transmit power constraint. We analyze the effects of pilot-symbol-aided channel estimation on the lower bound of the capacity and derive the optimal pilot-to-data power ratio (PDPR) in MIMO-OFDM systems with three different types of pilot patterns: independent, scattered, and orthogonal. The result implies that implementing the optimal PDPR in an actual MIMO-OFDM system should prove relatively straightforward, since there is a surprisingly broad range of PDPR values over which near optimal capacity is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577897","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

This result agrees with the previous work by Chiurtu et al. For multiuser broadcast channels, we obtain an upper bound on the sum capacity. We also show that the bound is asymptotically tight for high SNR when all user channels have the same Frobenius norm constraint and N/sub t/ /spl ges/ KN/sub r/, where N/sub t/ and N/sub r/ are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas and K is the number of users.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577902","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We study the capacity of a block fading multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channel with a linear receiver, which is estimated from a training sequence via a least squares (LS) algorithm. Given a fixed block size, the amount of training overhead plays a key role in balancing the quality of the receiver estimate and the data transmission time. Here we study the optimal training length, which maximizes the large system MIMO capacity, i.e., the number of transmit and receive antennas go to infinity with fixed ratio. In order to obtain a meaningful limit, the training length and packet length also increase in fixed proportion to the number of antennas. We show that the optimal amount of training grows as the square root of the block size, as the block size becomes large. Furthermore, only a slight benefit is obtained from optimizing the allocation of power across training and data symbols. Numerical results show that for a fixed block length, the capacity can be increased somewhat by adding a properly chosen diagonal loading factor to the LS algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large system capacity of MIMO block channels with least squares linear adaptive receivers","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We study the performance of the transmit diversity scheme introduced in the literature for a DS-CDMA system using orthogonal and nonorthogonal spreading codes over Rayleigh fast-fading channel with two antennas at the transmitter and one in the receiver side. For the single user case, and using orthogonal spreading codes, we develop the performance analysis for the underlying transmit diversity scheme over fast-fading channels. We prove that using such a space-time spreading scheme can achieve a twofold of the diversity order obtained using existing space-time spreading schemes. To examine the effect of signal interference on the receiver performance, we consider the case of nonorthogonal codes where we employ a linear minimum-mean square-error (MMSE) multiuser detector as a suboptimum linear detector. The performance of the multiuser system is examined for a moderate number of users where we show that the diversity order is still maintained and only a SNR loss is incurred due to the residual interference. Finally, we compare the performance of the MMSE multiuser detector to a simple adaptive MMSE combining scheme.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577906","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Multi-antenna technologies are an obvious candidate for increasing the downlink capacity, but successfully decoding spatially multiplexed signals is very challenging in an interference-limited environment, such as that of CDMA cellular systems. In this paper, a simple and novel MIMO-CDMA system design is developed, in which users are assigned to a transmit antenna either without regard to channel knowledge (static) or based on antenna selection feedback bits (dynamic). These proposed antenna partitioning techniques have a minimal increase in complexity and require only small changes to existing CDMA standards. The outage probability and capacity of the proposed systems are derived and it is shown that they outperform conventional CDMA systems regardless of the number of antennas or antenna partitioning technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna partitioning for multiuser MIMO-CDMA","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Thus, the new method can be used to select the best multicode set for a given system, a task that cannot be achieved using Gaussian approximations.

New results on the error performance of a family of multiuser detectors for MC-CDMA are obtained using the replica method, which was originally developed in statistical physics. The central result is the \"decoupling principle\", namely, an MC-CDMA channel with frequency-selective fading followed by a generic multiuser detection front end can be decoupled into a bank of single-user fading channels in the large-system limit. Thus conditioned on one's fading coefficients, each user essentially experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel with a degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in lieu of multiaccess interference. A set of joint equations is identified that determine the degradation for each user, known as the multiuser efficiency. The result applies to arbitrary input distribution and SNRs, and to optimal multiuser detection, as well as various other suboptimal schemes.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577910","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We show that by suitable precoding (modification) of the phase of the QPSK data at the transmitter (before spectrum spreading), it is possible to detect the data of any user blindly using only the knowledge of the preceding sequence, regardless of the power of the interferes. The proposed method can be seen as an extension to our earlier preceding approach for BPSK signals in AKS Al Bayati et al. (2004). However, the phase preceding/decoding operation of QPSK signals is a more challenging problem, especially in its decoding procedure. The proposed detection scheme has a deterministic nature and is therefore shown to provide performance advantage in the medium-to-high SNR region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1577913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1577913/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8946404","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Block phase precoding for blind multiuser detection in QPSK/DS-CDMA systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block phase precoding for blind multiuser detection in QPSK/DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01577913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06569S","chronDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33287","articleId":"1577913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1577914,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the proposed scheme, the signal transmitted by an active node is the product of an information-carrying code matrix and a unique node signature vector. It is shown that existing STBCs designed for N/sub c/ /spl ges/ 2 co-located antennas are favorable choices for the code matrix guaranteeing a diversity order of d = min{N/sub S/, N/sub c/} if n/sub S/ nodes are active. For the most interesting case N/sub S/ /spl ges/ N/sub c/ the performance loss entailed by the distributed implementation is analytically characterized.

MSDD, which jointly processes blocks of N received symbols to detect N - 1 data symbols, allows for power-efficient transmission over rapid-fading channels. However, the complexity of the straightforward approach to find the maximum-likelihood (ML) MSDD solution is exponential in N, the number of transmit antennas N/sub T/ and the rate R. In this paper, we introduce an MSDD algorithm based on sphere decoding whose average complexity is not exponential in N for interesting ranges of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and arbitrary unitary signal constellations. For the interesting special cases of diagonal and orthogonal constellations we achieve a similar complexity reduction in N/sub T/ and R. Based on an error-rate analysis for MSDD we also propose a variant of MSDD that considerably improves power efficiency in relatively fast fading at a very moderate increase in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577926","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The aim of DDoS attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing desired resources, such as network bandwidth. Hence the immediate task of DDoS defense is to provide as much resources as possible to legitimate users when there is an attack. Unfortunately most current defense approaches can not efficiently detect and filter out attack traffic. Our approach is to find the network anomalies by using neural network, deploy the system at distributed routers, identify the attack packets, and then filter them. The marks in the IP header that are generated by a group of IP traceback schemes, deterministic packet marking (DPM)/flexible deterministic packet marking (FDPM), assist this process of identifying attack packets. The experimental results show that this approach can be used to defend against both intensive and subtle DDoS attacks, and can catch DDoS attacks' characteristic of starting from multiple sources to a single victim. According to results, we find the marks in IP headers can enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of detection, thus improve the legitimate traffic throughput and reduce attack traffic throughput. Therefore, it can perform well in filtering DDoS attack traffic precisely and effectively.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577940","startPage":"5 pp.","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We present an architectural design of a coordinated access scheme based on a centralized gated-polling controller, and evaluate its performance in terms of scheduling delays and achievable throughputs. In particular, this paper proposes a list-scheduling algorithm for code assignment and analyzes its near-optimal performance. With theoretic analyses and simulations, we derive the relationships among system capacity, traffic load, and network performance, and establish an analytical framework to address practical issues regarding O-CDMA network planning. Performance results indicate that the code-limited system can achieve high throughputs at the expense of scheduling delays. The capacity requirement of the control channel is also investigated to ensure system stability. These results provide an in-depth insight into network dynamics of code-limited systems and can serve as guidelines for network planning and algorithm design","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of coordinated access schemes for code-limited optical-CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

In this paper, to mitigate both effects of scintillations and MAIs, we propose a symbol decision scheme by using the comparing detection. In our proposed scheme, the minimum output in all weighted positions is detected in each PPM slot. Then, the maximum-value out of the minimum outputs is detected, and, the symbol corresponding to the PPM slot in which the output has the maximum-value is decided. Since the received symbol is correctly decided as long as there is at least one weighted position without MAIs in other PPM slots, the proposed scheme can mitigate both effects of MAIs and scintillations.

Since the number of available codes C is always CGtK at any given time for an asynchronous OCDMA system employing quasi-orthogonal codes, there is always a set of unused codes and these codes can be exploited to increase the spectral efficiency of the system.

The equalizer tries to confine the channel intersymbol interference to a short span in order to limit the implementation complexity of the Viterbi detector. Equalization is usually made adaptive in order to compensate for channel variations. Conventional adaptation techniques, e.g. LMS, are in general suboptimal in terms of bit-error rate. In this paper we present a new equalizer adaptation algorithm that seeks to minimize bit-error rate at the Viterbi detector output. The algorithm extracts information from the sequenced amplitude margin (SAM) histogram and incorporates a selection mechanism that focuses adaptation on particular data and noise realizations. From a complexity standpoint, the algorithm is as simple as the conventional LMS algorithm.

These convergence rates can impact both the training sequence length requirements and the equalizer tracking ability for time-varying channels. We investigate a variety of equalizer architectures and algorithms and study the training sequence equalizer convergence behavior of QAM- and CAP-based VDSL systems by using both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo computer simulations.

By exploiting the fact that a circulant matrix (CM) is also a block circulant matrix (BCM), the proposed generalized cyclic prefixed (GCP) communication system provides an additional degree of freedom that allows trade-offs among peak-to-average power ratio (PAR), bit allocation capability, and frequency diversity. Instead of one large IDFT operation as in the OFDM transmitter, GCP time interleaves multiple smaller sized IDFT operations, so that PAR is correspondingly reduced. By appropriately selecting the block size in the BCM, the PAR value and the number of subcarriers for bit allocation can be chosen regardless of the length of the transmission block. When the block size in BCM is selected to be one or the entire size of the transmission block, the proposed GCP becomes OFDM or CPSC, respectively","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalization of single-carrier and multicarrier cyclic prefixed communication","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We find that digital selective relaying outperforms all other relaying configurations considered here while requiring the highest signalling overhead. The matched filter based hybrid relaying scheme appears to be a good suboptimum choice for its good performance and low signalling overhead in the multiple relay scenario.

A channel estimation is developed by exploiting the orthogonality between signal and noise subspaces and the soft estimate of coded bits of each user in conjunction with the output of the multiuser detector. The blind subspace channel estimation yields channel estimation with discrete valued phase ambiguities. By exploiting the robust combination of recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) decoder with a differential decoder for each user, an algorithm to resolve the phase error and simultaneously improving signal detection is proposed. Based on the proposed channel estimator and phase corrector, an iterative receiver is introduced for joint channel estimation, soft interference cancellation, linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filtering and iterative channel decoding.

On the other hand, it is desirable to minimise the overhead, making the design of training sequences a crucial task. Although this problem has been solved efficiently for OFDM systems using all subcarriers, it is still an open question for systems with nulled subcarriers (such as IEEE802.11a and IEEE802.11n), where some of the subcarriers are left unmodulated in order to fit specified spectrum masks. In this paper we present a numerical method for designing MIMO OFDM training sequences for arbitrary systems using nulled subcarriers. It is shown that substantial gains can be had over simple training sequences, such as only transmitting on non-overlapping subcarriers.

The improvement, however, is conditioned on the quality of the CSI, which can be compromised by estimation and quantization errors, and more significantly by delay. Channel prediction has been previously proposed to combat feedback delay. In this paper, a novel OFDM channel prediction algorithm that uses a 2 times 1-dimensional frequency estimation to determine the time-delays and Doppler frequencies of each propagation path is investigated. The algorithm assumes a general far-field scatterer, frequency-selective wireless channel model and hence is applicable to a wide variety of wireless channel conditions. It is shown that the method requires less feedback information and has better mean-squared error performance than previous methods.

The time-selective fading mobile channel severely degrades the performance of conventional detectors, since the time-selectivity of the fading channel destroys the orthogonality of the space-time codeword. Moreover, the complexity of the known symbol-by-symbol detectors is too high to be implemented, due to the multiple channel inversions.

The paper first formulates the problem by shifting each user's signals so that previous results on synchronized system for ISI cancellation based on second-order statistics of the received signals can be applied. The first step effectively reduces the quasi-synchronous system on the multipath channels to the quasi-synchronous system on single-path channels. In the second step, an equivalent model is constructed with the delay information embedded in the reduced channel model. A simultaneous time delay estimation and multiuser detection algorithm is then proposed. The proposed technique can easily be implemented in practical situations as perfect synchronization and knowledge of the channel length and the time delays are not required. Simulation results show that the proposed technique can achieve good performance and is not sensitive to overestimation of the maximum channel length and the maximum time delay","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

We present an information waveform manifold (IWM) based preprocessing reducing the dimensionality of the problem. It is based on nonlinear projector, optional processing on IWM and decoding isomorphism with channel symbols expansion space.

Although many alternative schemes have been devised to reduce the operational burden, the complexity of algorithmic schemes remains much higher than that of equalizer-based techniques, which in turn provide poor performance in terms of error rate. In this paper, we derive a low-complexity test that allows to run a more efficient but complex detection scheme only on selected received symbols. The few symbols that are identified as erroneously detected by the low complexity method are the only ones to be reprocessed. The global complexity is hence reduced, typically by more than one order of magnitude, with very little loss in performance","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578081","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

From our analyses, the reduction in the overall complexity due to further reduction of initial radius gets more significant as the SNR decreases.

In particular, we develop a system model in which the two wireless systems share radio resources in frequency, space and time, and reactive coordination methods are used to reduce the mutual interference and improve link throughput. Reactive cognitive radio schemes utilize the available degrees of freedom in frequency, power and time, and react to observations in these dimensions to avoid interference. Dynamic frequency selection (DFS) enables radios to choose the band with the least interference. power control (PC) allows communications at the least possible transmit power.

We propose a cooperative parallel file downloading scheme to reduce latency in cellular data networks. Mobile nodes form a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) via their IEEE 802.11-based links to share their cellular link capacity. A file is split into pieces and downloaded simultaneously by the client and several neighbor nodes that act as relay proxies. The proxies then use the MANET to forward packets to the client. Thus, the client uses multiple paths for parallel downloading. No special hardware or modifications on the base stations are needed. An on-demand proxy discovery algorithm is proposed for fast and efficient proxy discovery. Experimental and simulation results show that cooperative parallel file downloading may significantly improve cellular network utilization and file download performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578208/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8956040","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1578208/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using cooperative multiple paths to reduce file download latency in cellular data networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cooperative multiple paths to reduce file download latency in cellular data networks","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01578208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038277S","chronDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33289","articleId":"1578208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1578210,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ying Jun Zhang","id":"37279969700"},{"name":"Soung Chang Liew","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Soung Chang Liew","id":"37279300600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9414-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"1578210","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Telecommunication traffic","OFDM","Explosives","Multimedia systems","Real time systems","Wireless communication","Delay","Physical layer","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","OFDM modulation","packet switching","radio links","radio networks","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless OFDM networks","link-adaptive largest-weighted-throughput packet scheduling","real-time traffics","high-data-rate and multimedia real-time applications","wireless communications systems","QoS guarantees","wireless packet-switched networks","packet delay constraints","system spectral efficiency","MAC service discipline","rate-and-power adaptation scheme","packet loss rate"]}],"abstract":"The explosive growth of high-data-rate and multimedia real-time applications imposes new challenges on the design of future wireless communications systems.

With the rapid growth of wireless technologies, spectrum scarcity has become a serious problem as more and more wireless applications compete for very little spectrum. On the other hand the licensed spectrum allocated to applications like television, cellular telephony and public safety show very little usage over time at different geographical locations. The evolution of newer technologies has been seriously impaired because of current regulatory constraints on the operation of these networks in licensed spectrum, such as TV bands, and is being addressed by FCC through its recent rule making. With the goal of ubiquitous communication in mind, we look into spectrum agile radio, a new technology enabled by such FCC rule making, and study its advantages over conventional radios. In this paper, we first show the utilization achievable by agile radios through simple analysis. Then we will outline two types of agile radios and derive their maximum capacities.

However, due to the spatial dependence of radio signal strengths, it is possible for the collision avoidance mechanism to fail, resulting in packet collisions at the receiver and a reduction in system throughput. The CSMA/CA MAC protocol can be complemented in such scenarios by interference cancellation algorithms at the PHY layer. The corresponding gains in throughput are a result of the complex interplay between the PHY and MAC layers, and are evaluated in this paper via cross-layer simulations.

In the existing literature, distributed implementations are typically achieved by the means of the so-called dual decomposition technique. However, the span of decomposition possibilities includes many other elements which thus far have not been fully exploited, such as the use of the primal decomposition technique, the versatile introduction of auxiliary variables, and the potential of multilevel decompositions. This paper presents in a systematic way how to apply these decomposition techniques to network utility maximization problems. The presentation is based on a general network optimization model that unifies existing works, and then is particularized to two concrete examples of recent interest: generalized water-filling algorithms and wireless cellular downlink power control. We can thus obtain a variety of distributed algorithms with different characteristics to suit the needs of specific applications. Both primal and dual decomposition techniques are considered at many different hierarchy levels, leading to a range of choices of hybrid, multi-level, primal/dual decomposition schemes. Each particular combination provides a different distributed algorithm for resource allocation. The choice of decomposition method and distributed algorithm for a particular problem depends on factors such as the amount of signalling required for proper coordination, asymmetry of computational load, and speed of convergence.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed algorithms","Utility programs","Resource management","Power system modeling","Concrete","Cellular networks","Downlink","Power control","Distributed computing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","power consumption","radio links","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","network utility maximization","network resource management","decomposition techniques","network optimization model","generalized water-filling algorithms","wireless cellular downlink power control","resource allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578224","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

It is well-known that MIMO links in slow fading channels can benefit significantly through rate and power adaptations when there is knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). However, practical MIMO transmitter can only support finite combinations of the channel encoding rates and modulation constellation levels due to the finite number of bits allocated in the control overhead (embedded in the packet transmission) to inform the receiver of the current transmission mode. As a result of this practical limitation, there are several design issues concerning MIMO adaptation design. In this paper, we shall address various practical MIMO adaptation design issues such as how many different transmission modes are needed, how to determine the specific channel encoding rates and modulation constellation levels for each transmission modes as well as how to choose select a transmission mode for the current packet transmission given a particular CSIT. We propose a systematic design framework to address the MIMO adaptation design based on information theoretical framework. We assume time division duplex (TDD) systems with quasi-static fading channels where packet outage is an important concern with imperfect CSIT. The design problem is cast into an optimization problem similar to the classical vector quantization problem with a modified distortion measure.

A source node wants to transmit a sequence of messages to a single destination node. Other nodes in the network may operate as relay nodes. The problem is to do this with the minimum overall power consumption in the network. In this paper we investigate the power saving that can be achieved by using advanced relay-channel signaling rather than traditional multi-hop routing. Under the assumptions that carrier level synchronization is not available and every intermediate node uses a decode-forward scheme, we show that any optimal relaying structure can be converted to a sequential path, for which we find a simple optimal power-allocation policy. Finding an optimal sequential path is still complex, and we therefore present two polynomial heuristic algorithms to find good cooperative routes. Our simulation results show that they can achieve average power savings of up to 3 dB for a network size of 60 nodes in low attenuation regimes. For high attenuation regimes, cooperative routing exhibits limited gain and traditional multi-hop operation is a reasonable choice","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578256","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The complexity of finding the optimal loading policy and its' implementation issues are described. Since finding the optimal policies becomes complex and practically un-realizable for large number of carriers in the system, we offer a sub-optimal power and bit loading algorithm using the results of the single carrier system's power and rate adaptation policy and a greedy approach.

Unlike the mu-law companding scheme, which enlarges only small signals so that increases the average power, the schemes based on exponential companding technique adjust both large and small signals and can keep the average power at the same level. By transforming the original OFDM signals into uniformly distributed signals (with a specific degree), the exponential companding schemes can effectively reduce PAPR for different modulation formats and sub-carrier sizes. Moreover, many PAPR reduction schemes, such as mu-law companding scheme, cause spectrum side-lobes generation, but the exponential companding schemes cause less spectrum side-lobes. Computer simulations, which consider a baseband OFDM system with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and a solid state power amplifier (SSPA), show that the proposed exponential companding schemes can offer better PAPR reduction, bit error rate (BER), and phase error performance than the mu-law companding scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

This paper analyzes clipped M-ary differentially encoded phase-shift keying (M-DPSK) OFDM. The impact of input power backoff (IBO) of a nonlinear power amplifier (PA) is evaluated. An effective PAPR reduction scheme should provide one of the two equivalent enhancements: 1) a reduced error floor at a given backoff, or 2) a reduced required IBO to achieve a target BER. The later is addressed by determining the total degradation (TD) of the system at various IBO. By this measure, it is shown that clipping is ineffective. Moreover, it is shown that clipping PAPR reduction doesn't improve the spectral broadening caused by the PA. The linearity of the amplifier is viewed at various backoff ratios, defined as K = IBO/PAPR. Since K is best viewed statistically, so is the linearity of the PA.

Computer simulation results present the efficiency of the proposed scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

It has been shown in previous works that such a scheme causes queue management problems in the buffers shared by multiple mobiles, e.g. the input buffer at base station controller (BSC), when their rates are increased after a period of lower aggregate data rate in radio links. Traditionally buffer management techniques like random early detection (RED) are used for a single buffer only. In this paper, we extend the RED algorithm to an aggregated queueing algorithm (AQuA) that simultaneously regulates the queueing discipline in both the shared and individual link buffers so that buffer overflow problems after aggregate link rate increase do not occur. Our algorithm relies on standard information on queueing backlog in link buffers available at BSC to perform buffer management in a unified manner with shared buffer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach provides significantly greater determinism in packet transit delays over BSC and greater throughputs and similar levels of fairness as RED mechanism in shared buffers in conjunction with unregulated link buffers","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578286","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The traditional least-square solution based on the pseudo-inverse operation therefore has its limitation. In addition, a sufficiently long training sequence to estimate the complete ICI matrix is not feasible since it results in the severe throughput reduction. In this paper, we derive a lower bound for the mean-square estimation error among the least-square ICI matrix estimators using different training sequences and prove that the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) optimality is attained when the training sequences carried by different OFDM blocks are orthogonal to each other, regardless of the sequence length. Then we propose to employ the training sequences based on the padded maximal-length shift-register sequences (m-sequences) so as to achieve a highly efficient and optimal ICI matrix estimator with the minimum mean-square estimation error among all least-square ICI matrix estimators. Besides, our new scheme involves only linear complexity while other existing least-square methods require the complexity proportional to the cube of the ICI matrix size. Both analytical and experimental comparisons between our new scheme using padded m-sequences and the existing method using conventional m-sequences justify the significant advantages of our new ICI matrix estimator","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new ICI matrix estimation technique using padded m-sequences for wireless OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

This enables the possibility of enhancing the system's performance by deploying adaptive (dynamic) mechanisms, namely power and modulation adaption and dynamic sub-carrier assignments. In multi-user communication systems (OFDM-FDMA), these mechanisms can be used to achieve a level of system fairness ensuring that each terminal receives at least an environment-specific minimum amount of data per down-link phase. However, it has been doubted by multiple previous investigations that dynamic power adaption provides enough performance gain in order to be applied in such systems, as it increases the computational load significantly.

An algorithm is derived and its performance merit for implementing VGI in the presence of carrier frequency offset is provided. OFDM system needs to maintain orthogonality among sub carriers, which may be lost due insufficient guard interval and carrier frequency offset (due to local oscillator mismatch and Doppler effects). Static guard interval is usually kept large enough to tolerate worst case channel delay spread conditions, which in turn causes loss in efficiency of the system. The use of variable guard interval is expected to improve the system throughput. Since insufficient guard interval and carrier offset together cause orthogonality loss among sub carriers, the dynamic selection of guard interval in the presence of carrier frequency offset is considered in this work. Results are presented to analyze achievable gains. It has been shown that significant improvement in throughput is achievable by this scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

A soft iterative receiver structure is developed which consists of three main blocks, a soft MIMO detector and two LDPC component soft decoders. Without forming any specific channel estimate, we propose several soft MIMO detectors at the component level that offer an effective tradeoff between complexity and performance. At the structural level, the LDPC-coded MIMO receiver is constructed in a unconventional manner where the soft MIMO detector and LDPC variable node decoder form one super soft-decoding unit, and the LDPC check node decoder forms the other component of the iterative decoding scheme. By exploiting the proposed receiver structure, tractable extrinsic information transfer functions of the component soft decoders are obtained, which further lead to a simple and efficient LDPC code degree profile optimization algorithm with proven global optimality and guaranteed convergence from any initialization. Finally, numerical and simulation results are provided to confirm the advantages of the proposed design approach for the coded system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578297/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1578297/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8956124","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","displayDocTitle":"LDPC-coded MIMO receiver design over unknown fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC-coded MIMO receiver design over unknown fading channels","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01578297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080966S","chronDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","xplore-issue":"33289","articleId":"1578297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1578298,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In MIMO systems, the channel estimation is important to distinguish transmit signals from multiple transmit antennas. While the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is known to offer good channel estimation and data detection. We proposed earlier the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based SAGE algorithm for MIMO systems where the MMSE estimation is used for channel estimation. We showed that the proposed MMSE-based SAGE algorithm can achieve the better bit error rate (BER) than the maximum likelihood (ML) detection with training symbols. The MMSE channel estimation needs the knowledge of the maximum Doppler frequency F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n for deriving the covariance matrix of the channel and the variance sigma\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

This near-optimal scheme allocates one half of the total power to the source node and splits the remaining half equally among selected relay nodes; a node is selected for relay if it is able to decode the signal from the source and its mean channel gain to the destination is above a threshold.

The demodulated symbols may become unreliable due to fading, thermal noise, and partial band interference (PBI). Since error correcting codes can correct more erasures than errors, it is often beneficial to erase these unreliable symbols rather than feeding them to the decoder. In this paper, we first extend the Bayesian erasure insertion, originally proposed in C.W. Baum and M.B. Pursley (1992) for FSK modulation, to the case when differential space-time modulation is used. We then propose a simple, suboptimal erasure insertion scheme based on a likelihood ratio threshold test (LRTT). Simulation results show that substantial improvements in decoding error probability can be achieved by the proposed schemes over the non-erasure-insertion scheme, especially when the partial-band interference becomes severe","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The receiver selects the feedback matrix from the codebook according to a specific selection criterion and transfers the index of the chosen matrix to the transmitter. Hence the CSI is not required at the transmitter in the proposed precoder. The codebook design criterion and feedback matrix selection criteria are analyzed.

It enables the high capacity intrinsically offered by CDMA by making the equalization of the multipath channels and the mitigation of the resulting interference possible at a low complexity. This paper proposes a new air interface that combines SC-CDMA with space time block coding (STBC) across multiple transmit antennas in order to robustify the link. Contrary to existing air interfaces that perform the STBC encoding at the chip level, making them only applicable to the downlink, the STBC encoding is performed at the symbol level, making it also applicable to the uplink. In order to optimally detect the antenna and user signals, a joint detector optimized according to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is designed. By exploiting the cyclo-stationarity of the channels, the complexity of the joint detector is significantly reduced. It is analytically shown that the inter-antenna interference is canceled out at the output of the first stage of the linear MMSE joint detector, consisting of a matched filter. Assuming typical outdoor channels, a gain of 4 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is achieved by the use of two transmit antennas over the single antenna system","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578338","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The detector, termed a Fano ST-MSDD, uses the Fano algorithm as its decoding engine and is capable of delivering excellent error performance at moderate implementation complexity over a wide range of fading rates. Essentially, the detector is an \"intelligent\" decision feedback detector (DFD) that uses a running threshold and the accumulated path metric as navigation tools when it roams the decoding tree. In the static channel, our best Fano ST-MSDD scheme with a detection window size of N=6 is able to narrow the original 3 dB gap between ideal coherent and conventional ST differential detection by 1 dB. In a fast fading channel with a Doppler frequency of three percent the ST symbol rate, the error curve of our best TV-10 Fano ST-MSDD is able to \"track\" that of the ideal coherent detector (with a 3-dB gap in between) and there is no irreducible error floor. All these performances become even more remarkable when we consider the rather moderate implementation complexity reported in the paper. Because of its close relationship with a DFD, the Fano ST-MSDD has a similar complexity as the DFD at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization framework to jointly design the scheduling and power control in wireless ad hoc networks. We study the system performance by combining scheduling, power control, and adaptive modulation. Specifically, the transmitted power and constellation size are dynamically adapted based on the packet arrival, quality of service (QoS) requirements, power limits, and channel conditions. A key feature of the proposed method is that it facilitates a distributed implementation, which is desirable in wireless ad hoc networks. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme achieves significant gains in both throughput and power efficiency compared to typical methods, which implement the scheduling through a central controller, and adopt power control with fixed modulation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer scheduling and power control combined with adaptive modulation for wireless ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The proposed scheduling and antenna sharing method, referred to as fast transmit antenna selection (FTAS), uses adaptive proportional fairness (APF) mapping as a means to determine the user-antenna assignment that maximizes the network performance both in terms of throughput and fairness. The proposed scheduler is applied in a high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) network, taking advantage of an inherent HSDPA characteristic, namely, the use of adaptive modulation and coding, while coping with the imposed maximum number of simultaneously supported codes and the absence of fast power control.

It is demonstrated that part of the effects is compensated by the channel estimation and an expression of the variance of the remaining error is provided.

This increases the required feedback bandwidth and the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) at the transmitter. In this paper, we observe that the spectrum of the spreading sequences designed according to existing algorithms are narrowband and are located at the strongest spectral components of the users' channels. The narrowbandness of spreading sequences allows one to represent each user's sequence with fewer number of parameters and, hence, reduces the required number of feedback bits to represent those sequences. Further, the narrowbandness of the spectra allows one to break the global optimization of the users' cross correlation matrix into simple sub optimal local (grouped) optimizations.

It enables the high capacity intrinsically offered by CDMA by making the equalization of the multi-path channels and the mitigation of the resulting interference possible at a low complexity. This paper studies the impact of multi-user sample clock offset on the performance of up-link SC-CDMA and proposes a compensation strategy at the receiver. It is shown that clock offset leads to an unacceptable degradation of the performance if it is not compensated. In a simultaneous multi-user up-link system, the sample clock offset is usually pre-compensated at the transmitters. This paper demonstrates that the compensation can also be done at the receiver. In a first step the optimal linear multi-user joint detector is designed according to the MMSE criterion, taking the effect of clock offset into account. In a second step the MMSE joint detector is simplified to a low complexity detector incurring a negligible loss of performance","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact and compensation of sample clock offset on up-link SC-CDMA","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

In this paper we evaluate the reverse link performance improvement (in terms of coverage and data throughput) of IS-856-A with the use of more advanced antenna array receivers. Specifically, we consider the effect of increasing the receiver antenna array size and utilizing more sophisticated beamforming schemes. We quantify the capacity improvement via analysis as well as comprehensive system simulations that incorporate realistic channel models and the dynamics associated with MAC-layer algorithms in addition to the physical-layer interactions. We show that DO Rev. A with 4-way antenna diversity on the reverse link achieves more than 3 dB gain over 2-way diversity receivers in sector throughput. We also demonstrate a coverage improvement on the order of 6 dB, which can be translated into further throughput gains by relaxing the interference control mechanism","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578399","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

The orthogonality factor (OF), which models its impact in the link signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equation, depends - to a large extent - on the power delay profile of the multipath channel between the mobile and its serving base station. We use the comprehensive and general COST259 channel model for urban cellular environments to evaluate the impact on the OF of multipath clusters and distance-dependence of the multipath delay decay time constant, both of which have been observed in several channel measurements. The observed large standard deviation of the OF indicates that using a single value for all users in downlink capacity analyses and simulations, as has been the practice, may lead to erroneous conclusions. We also propose an empirical model to analytically characterize the observed statistics of the OF","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Using a 1 times 2 wideband measurement chain, four indoor environments have been investigated: a corridor, a small office, an electrical engineering laboratory, and an industrial hall. The measurement equipment is constituted by an 80-MHz transmitter. At the receiver, two omnidirectional antennas are connected to a wideband channel sounder through a switch, in order to measure an estimate of the instantaneous vector channel. Special attention is given to the experimental procedure itself, so as to take into account the specificity of nomadic systems (as opposed to usual mobile systems). The measurement analysis reveals that the shadowing, Ricean K-factor and delay-spread are lognormally distributed. A path-loss model is derived, and cross-correlations between K-factor, delay-spread and shadowing are analyzed.

However, algorithms for a large antenna array (LAA) remain an open research problem. The standard channel estimation and space-time modulation schemes are not practical for LAAs due to high implementation complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel transmit beamforming scheme based on a reconfigurable LAA. Compared to the traditional schemes, our new scheme requires a much smaller number of radio frequency (RF) chains, yet it still enjoys the high performance offered from the LAA. Based on a reconfigurable LAA, we present a pilot assisted round robin channel estimation algorithm. With this estimation algorithm, the tracking of the fading channel is significantly simplified at the mobile station. We then introduce an adaptive transmit beamforming algorithm based on relative channel phase feedback at the transmitter. For a time varying Rayleigh fading channel, we investigate the system SNR as a function of the latency of the round robin channel estimation and derive the optimal training duration for given mobile speed. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme accomplishes superior performance for various kinds of time varying Rayleigh fading channels. Overall, the proposed system enjoys good performance, high flexibility, low cost as well as low power consumption at both the base station and mobile station","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8956199","htmlLink":"/document/1578411/","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming for a large reconfigurable antenna array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming for a large reconfigurable antenna array","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01578411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073884S","chronDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33290","articleId":"1578411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1578413,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Wei Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"lastName":"Chee Wei Tan","id":"37309056200"},{"name":"D.P.

Previous work have been done in the high SIR regime by solving these problems with nonlinear objectives and constraints as geometric programs. However, in the medium to low SIR regime, these problems cannot be transformed into tractable convex optimization problems. This paper makes two contributions: (1) In the low SIR regime, we propose a method with centralized computation to obtain the globally optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs. (2) While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been investigated before this paper. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control based on geometric programs in high SIR regime.

It is well known that either BF or MRC in SIMO systems does not perform properly in spatially correlated channels, because the former assumes completely coherent fades over the entire antenna elements while the latter assumes independent fades. Here, we study a merger of BF and SIMO via virtual channel representation (VCR). VCR is used as a consistent description of coherent, correlated and independent channels to derive the proposed algorithm. Specifically, this study is performed for a simple SIMO system which leads to high performance gains in spatially correlated channels. The study can be easily generalized to Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) systems.

How to integrate them has become an important issue. The integration should be done in both radio access networks (RANs) and core networks. The current trend is to integrate various RANs with an IP-based core network so users with a multi-mode handset or reconfigurable radio, such as software defined radio (SDR), could seamlessly roam among different RANs. With this all-IP paradigm, there should be one common core network, or various core networks should be compatible. Unfortunately, although both 3GPP and 3GPP2 have adopted IP in their packet-switched core networks, the architectures and protocols are not necessary compatible. In addition, they are also different from today's Internet. A user with reconfigurable radio still could not roam seamlessly among 3GPP, 3GPP2, and other IP core networks. As that in RANs, in this paper we propose a reconfigurable architecture in which users could use different protocols in core networks dynamically. There are many potential research topics for the reconfigurable core network. This paper focuses on reconfigurable mobility management. An architecture called reconfigurable architecture and mobility platform (RAMP) is proposed. Both analytical model and simulation are developed to analyze the architecture. In addition, a testbed is constructed. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconfigurable architectures","Radio access networks","Software radio","Protocols","Analytical models","Telephone sets","Computer architecture","Internet","Mobile radio mobility management","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","computer network management","IP networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","protocols","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable architecture and mobility platform","IP-based core network","software defined radio","3GPP","protocols","reconfigurable mobility management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578436","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Simulations demonstrate that these cooperative schemes achieve significant performance gain.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1578469","startPage":"5 pp.","endPage":"3742","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Although many possible combinations of system parameters have been specified in the current 1xEV-DV standard, there is no further specification on how to dynamically choose the optimal combination of system parameters, such as the number of Walsh codes, the number of time slots, the modulation scheme, and the channel data rate, according to variations of buffer usage and channel quality. In this paper, we first review the latest cdma2000 1xEV-DV standard focusing on its unique features. Then, we propose a new delay-bounded dynamic resource allocation scheme for the QoS provisioning in cdma2000 1xEV-DV networks. The proposed scheme supports dynamic resource allocation by selecting the optimal combination of system parameters to satisfy the QoS requirements imposed by user applications, based on not only the channel quality but also the queue length.

Hence, in this paper, we develop a linear MMSE-based turbo equalization scheme for downlink ST block coded CDMA to achieve high capacity gains over multipath fading channels. The proposed unified CDMA system model considers both conventional and block spreading. However, block spreading is more desirable as confirmed by the simulation results. Both ST encoding and ST decoding are performed at the chip-block level. Turbo equalization is performed after ST decoding. Furthermore, we also consider computationally-efficient implementations of the proposed turbo equalization scheme.

These STTCs are originally designed for the open loop systems where no channel state information is available at the transmitter. To further enhance the performance of these STTCs, we assume that the scalar quantized channel magnitude information is available at the transmitter through a feedback channel. Therefore, the error performance of these STTCs is improved through proper power loading on the different transmit antennas. To calculate the power loading parameters, we derive the distance spectrum of these STTCs based on the channel magnitude information. We also use a novel transfer function analysis to optimize the overall distance spectrum. The proposed power loading algorithm is flexible enough to be applied for various kinds of existing STTCs and it also enjoys easy implementation at the transmitter. Finally, numerical simulations show that the new power loading scheme accomplishes superior performance compared to several widely used open loop algorithms as well as some popular closed loop algorithms in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1578496/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8967075","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A power loading scheme for space-time trellis codes based on channel magnitude feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power loading scheme for space-time trellis codes based on channel magnitude feedback","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01578496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046426S","chronDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33290","articleId":"1578496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1578497,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Jiang","id":"37292011800"},{"name":"Xiayu Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Xiayu Zheng","id":"37289299100"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37279843500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9414-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"1578497","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":631},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Diversity methods","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Fading","Bit error rate","MIMO","Transmitters","Channel capacity","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO systems","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","point-to-point MIMO communications","Rayleigh flat fading channel","transmitting antennas","antennas","zero-forcing V-BLAST","minimum mean-squared-error V-BLAST","BER","diversity gains","estimators"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis of the V-BLAST scheme at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.

Fundamental results are proven to show that the diversity order of linear equalizers over fading channels can be the minimum (one) or the maximum diversity the channel offers. By exploiting the structure of the channel matrix, an alternative closed form expression for the pseudo-inverse is derived to reduce the complexity of the equalizer. Also, by quantifying the computational complexity, we demonstrate the complexity-performance tradeoff among the design for various linear equalizers. When the conditional error rate is known in closed form, a novel efficient approach is proposed to calculate the performance of linear zero-forcing equalizers. Corroborating simulations confirm that even with linear equalization, the block transmission systems perform better over channels with more taps at practical high SNRs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1578499/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8967078","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of linear equalizers for block transmission systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of linear equalizers for block transmission systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"01578499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074608S","chronDate":"2-2 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10511","isNumber":"33290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10511","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33290","articleId":"1578499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":1578500,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Chun Wang","id":"37280758200"},{"name":"Chih-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Wen Chang","id":"37290544400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9414-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-529X"}],"articleNumber":"1578500","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Frequency domain analysis","Error correction","Multiple access interference","Frequency conversion","OFDM","Time domain analysis","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","OFDM modulation","power control","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier DS-CDMA","imperfect power control","variable spreading factors","MC-DS-CDMA","multipath dispersion","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDM","time-domain spreading technique","frequency-domain spreading technique","power control errors","bit error rate","multiple access interference"]}],"abstract":"The MC-DS-CDMA possesses the advantages of the immunity against multipath dispersion of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM) and the flexibility of the time-domain and frequency-domain spreading technique. However, power control errors (PCE) may significantly degrade the performance of the MC-DS-CDMA system. In this paper, we propose an easily computed analytical method to evaluate the bit error rate performance of the multi-rate MC-DS-CDMA system with the time/frequency 2-domain spreading subject to PCE. Furthermore, the proposed analysis also considers the effect of multiple access interference (MAI) from all the subcarriers in the multi-rate MC-DS-CDMA system. We find that power control errors will offset the gain of frequency domain spreading.

The mobile station first estimates the complete (frequency selective) downlink channel responses between all transmit and receive antenna combinations and then transmits these responses back to the base in the frequency domain in place of the usual data symbols. The base station equalizes the received feedback signal and recovers the channel information by using standard channel estimation techniques. Using some signal processing tricks, multiple channel responses can be encoded together and sent back in a single feedback message, making the feedback very bandwidth efficient. Additional gains in bandwidth efficiency are provided by allowing multiple mobile stations to transmit their feedback on the same time-frequency resource in a spatial division multiple access (SDMA) fashion.

Depending on the channel realization, the receiver decides the optimal beamforming vector on each subcarrier, and informs the transmitter through a rate-limited feedback link. Exploiting the fact that the channel responses across OFDM subcarriers are correlated, we propose two methods to reduce the amount of needed feedback. One is recursive feedback encoding that selects the optimal beamforming vectors sequentially across the subcarriers, and adopts a smaller-size time-varying codebook per subcarrier depending on prior decisions. The other is trellis-based feedback encoding that selects the optimal beamforming vectors for all subcarriers at once along a trellis structure via the A. The trellis-based feedback encoding outperforms the recursive feedback encoding at the expense of encoding complexity at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that our trellis-based approach outperforms an existing interpolation-based alternative, as the latter incurs diversity loss at high SNR","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive and trellis-based feedback reduction for MIMO-OFDM with transmit beamforming","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

In this paper, a multiuser resource allocation and management approach which combines adaptive sub-carrier allocation as well as a power and bit distribution based on partial channel state information is proposed to significantly improve the performance of a multiuser MIMO/OFDM system. It is shown that the proposed methodology, which relies on the combination of beamforming and orthogonal space-time block coding, guarantees all the users with a quality of service required for a minimum targeted BER. It can also optimize the power efficiency as well as the sub-carriers allocation in order to maximize the data rate while ensuring fairness among all the users. In particular, it is shown that by taken advantage of the channel side information obtained through both, mean and covariance feedback, the proposed methodology exhibits resistance to the Doppler effects due to correlated channel variations while achieving good system performance","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for multiuser MIMO/OFDM networks based on partial channel state information","publicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

Using the proposed scheme, better performance can be achieved by using more DFT/IDFT blocks at the receiver and/or the transmitter. However, the margin of the performance improvement decreases along with the increase of the number of DFT/IDFT blocks. Therefore, the proposed scheme can be used to effectively trade off system performance and complexity. Furthermore, to calculate the weighting coefficients for the proposed scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to achieve good performance with reasonable complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"GLOBECOM '05.

BSIM and Liu's circuit agree completely for the frequency response of a common-source amplifier. This example shows that Liu's complex transconductance is essential to find the correct corner frequency. The complex transconductance provides the same corner frequency regardless of the value selected for the BSIM parameter XPART, which is not true of a circuit with a real transconductance. The value selected for XPART affects somewhat the higher frequency pole of this amplifier, and affects radically the high frequency zero. As a result, uncertainty in the value of XPART translates directly into uncertainty in the high frequency response, and a corresponding uncertainty in design.","doi":"10.1109/MCD.2005.1578586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices

The system performs rectification of the input video stream and a left-right consistency check to improve the accuracy of the results and generates subpixel disparities at 30 frames/second on 480 \u00d7 640 images. The system is based on the Local Weighted Phase- Correlation algorithm [9] which estimates disparity using a multi-scale and multi-orientation approach. Though FPGAs are ideal devices to exploit the inherent parallelism in many computer vision algorithms, they have a finite resource capacity which poses a challenge when adapting a system to deal with large image sizes or disparity ranges. In this work, we take advantage of the temporal information available in a video sequence to design a novel architecture for the correlation unit to achieve correlation over a large range while keeping the resource utilisation very low as compared to a naive approach of designing a correlation unit in hardware.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10542/33355/01578701.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICVS.2006.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVS.2006.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1578701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Large Disparity Range Stereo-System using FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Stereo vision","Streaming media","Phase estimation","Parallel processing","Computer vision","Video sequences","Computer architecture","Resource management","Hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Large Disparity Range Stereo-System using FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578701/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real-Time Large Disparity Range Stereo-System using FPGAs","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01578701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069215S","chronDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10542","isNumber":"33355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10542","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"33355","articleId":"1578701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1578709,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed method addresses a basic problem of standard ICP, i.e. its inability to perform the segmentation of data points and to deal with large displacements. Neither a-priori knowledge of the motion nor inputs from other sensors are required, while the only assumption is that the scene always contains visually distinctive features which can be tracked over subsequent stereo pairs. This generates what is usually called Visual Odometry. The paper details the various steps of the algorithm and presents the results of experimental tests performed with an allterrain mobile robot, proving the method to be as accurate as effective for autonomous navigation purposes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10542/33355/01578709.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"21","publicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICVS.2006.56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICVS.2006.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1578709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo-Based Ego-Motion Estimation Using Pixel Tracking and Iterative Closest Point","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative closest point algorithm","Iterative algorithms","Image segmentation","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Layout","Tracking","Testing","Performance evaluation","Mobile robots","Navigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stereo-Based Ego-Motion Estimation Using Pixel Tracking and Iterative Closest Point","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578709/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2006","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo-Based Ego-Motion Estimation Using Pixel Tracking and Iterative Closest Point","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"01578709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040398S","chronDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10542","isNumber":"33355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10542","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"33355","articleId":"1578709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1578718,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In some cases, these objectives and constraints are non-commensurable and they are not explicitly/mathematically available. For this kind of problems, interactive optimization may be a good approach. Interactive optimization means that a human user evaluates the potential solutions in qualitative way. In recent years evolutionary computation (EC) was applied for interactive optimization, which approach has became known as interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). The aim of this paper is to propose a new interactive optimization method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is a relatively new population based optimization approach, whose concept originates from the simulation of simplified social systems. The paper shows that interactive PSO cannot be based on the same concept as IEC because the information sharing mechanism of PSO significantly differs from EC. So this paper proposes an approach which considers the unique attributes of PSO.

For example, grouping soldiers intelligently to tank combat units, we should take into consideration the combined technical proficiency of the soldiers, the amount of military training, the units from which the soldiers come, their service age, personal background, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid fuzzy-genetic algorithm (FGA) approach to solve the crew grouping problem. Fuzzy logic based controllers are applied to fine-tune dynamically the crossover and mutation probability in the genetic algorithms, in an attempt to improve the algorithm performance. The FGA approach is compared with the standard genetic algorithm (SGA). Empirical results clearly demonstrates that while the SGA approach gives satisfactory solutions for the problem, the FGA method usually performs significantly better.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2005.51","startPage":"332","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10543/33356/01578807.pdf","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2005.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid fuzzy-genetic algorithm approach for crew grouping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy logic","Genetic mutations","Computer science","Military computing","Mathematical analysis","Data structures","Algorithm design and analysis","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military systems","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fuzzy-genetic algorithm","crew grouping problem","hybrid FGA approach","fuzzy logic based controllers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid fuzzy-genetic algorithm approach for crew grouping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8733049","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid fuzzy-genetic algorithm approach for crew grouping","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"01578807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054381S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10543","isNumber":"33356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10543","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33356","articleId":"1578807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1578837,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For example, the sample median quality is the best estimator of what one would expect to achieve in 50% of runs, and similarly for other quantiles. In multiobjective optimization, the notion still applies but the outcome of a run is measured not as a scalar (i.e. the cost of the best solution), but as an attainment surface in k-dimensional space (where k is the number of objectives). In this paper we report an algorithm that can be conveniently used to plot summary attainment surfaces in any number of dimensions (though it is particularly suited for three). A summary attainment surface is defined as the union of all tightest goals that have been attained (independently) in precisely s of the runs of a sample of n runs, for any s/spl isin/1..n, and for any k. We also discuss the computational complexity of the algorithm and give some examples of its use. C code for the algorithm is available from the author.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10543/33356/01578842.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"557","publicationTitle":"5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2005.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2005.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1578842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A summary-attainment-surface plotting method for visualizing the performance of stochastic multiobjective optimizers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Stochastic processes","Optimization methods","Approximation algorithms","Shape","Chemistry","Cost function","Extraterrestrial measurements","Computational complexity","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","computational complexity","approximation theory","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic multiobjective optimizer","summary attainment surface plotting method","approximation sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A summary-attainment-surface plotting method for visualizing the performance of stochastic multiobjective optimizers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8733084","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A summary-attainment-surface plotting method for visualizing the performance of stochastic multiobjective optimizers","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"01578842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099063S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10543","isNumber":"33356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10543","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"33356","articleId":"1578842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1578843,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For wireless sensor networks (WSN), regular topologies, which can help to efficiently save energy and achieve long networking lifetime, have been well studied in [1, 4, 5, 7, 9]. However, little work is focused on routing in patterned WSNs except the shortest path routing with the knowledge of global location information. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol based on random walk. It doesn\u2019t require global location information. Moreover, the random walk routing achieves load balancing property inherently for WSNs which is difficult to achieve for other routing protocols. We also prove that the random walk routing consumes the same amount of energy as the shortest path routing in the scenarios where the message required to be sent to the base station is in comparatively small size with the inquiry message among neighboring nodes. Since in many applications of WSNs, sensor nodes often send only beeplike small messages to the base station to report their status, our proposed random walk routing is a viable scheme. Though the random walk routing provides load balancing in the WSN, the nodes near to the base station (BS) are inevitably under heavier burden than the nodes far from the base station. Therefore we further propose a density-aware deployment scheme to guarantee that the heavy-load nodes do not affect the network lifetime even if they are exhausted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1578896/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"RandomWalk Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RandomWalk Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01578896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04311S","chronDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10544","isNumber":"33357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10544","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"33357","articleId":"1578896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1578970,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Jin","affiliation":["Computer School, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Hui Jin","id":"37556246900"},{"name":"Yanxiang He","affiliation":["Computer School, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Yanxiang He","id":"37272938700"},{"name":"Weidong Wen","affiliation":["Computer School, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Weidong Wen","id":"37556895200"},{"name":"Haowen Liu","affiliation":["Computer School, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Haowen Liu","id":"37069196800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2405-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"1578970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1578970","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Costs","Computational efficiency","Distributed computing","Multiagent systems","Computational modeling","Data flow computing","Concurrent computing"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a run-time scheduling policy to map tasks to resources in grid computing systems based on Multi-Agent System (MAS).

The local operator is a simple GA named as Local Genetic Algorithm (LGA). The LGA is combined to another GA named as Global Genetic Algorithm (GGA). It increases the computational time running a GA as a local operator in another one. To solve this problem, we build a parallel system based on our previous works for running the LGA to speed up the process. The results show that LGA improve the search quality significantly and it is more efficient running LGA with parallel system than single CPU.","doi":"10.1109/PDCAT.2005.129","startPage":"620","endPage":"623","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10544/33357/01578994.pdf","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDCAT.2005.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency of Local Genetic Algorithm in Parallel Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Parallel processing","Cities and towns","Genetic mutations","Control engineering computing","Concurrent computing","Control engineering","Educational institutions","Traveling salesman problems","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm (GA)","parallel GA","global GA","local GA","object shared space","Traveling Salesman Problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm (GA)","parallel GA","global GA","local GA","object shared space","Traveling Salesman Problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency of Local Genetic Algorithm in Parallel Processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency of Local Genetic Algorithm in Parallel Processing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01578994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049146S","chronDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10544","isNumber":"33357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10544","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33357","articleId":"1578994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1578995,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Cui-xiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Zhong Cui-xiang","id":"38365435100"},{"name":"Han Guo-qiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Han Guo-qiang","id":"38350763800"},{"name":"Huang Ming-he","affiliation":["Software College, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Huang Ming-he","id":"38269999400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2405-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"1578995","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Multiprocessing systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Concurrent computing","Computer science","Educational institutions","Application software","Signal processing","Image processing"]}],"abstract":"Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has many applications in digital signal and image processing and other scientific and technological domains, but its time complexity of direct computation is O(n2), limiting greatly its application range. Thus many people have developed fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, reducing the complexity from O(n2) to O(nlogn)(In this paper logn denotes log2n).But for large n, O(nlogn) is still very high. So multiprocessor systems have been used to speed up the computation of DFT. This paper first introduces a new general method to deduce FFT algorithms, then transforms the deduced second radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm into another parallelizable sequential form, and finally transforms the latter algorithm into a new parallel FFT algorithm, reducing the time complexity of DFT to O(nlogn/p) (where p is the number of processors). Using similar methods, the authors can also design other new parallel 1-D and 2-D FFT algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PDCAT.2005.224","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10544/33357/01578995.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDCAT.2005.224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some New Parallel Fast Fourier Transform Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1578995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1578995/","displayDocTitle":"Some New Parallel Fast Fourier Transform Algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1578995/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some New Parallel Fast Fourier Transform Algorithms","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01578995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054133S","chronDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10544","isNumber":"33357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10544","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33357","articleId":"1578995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1579004,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yi Liu","id":"37087200966"},{"name":"Yanping Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yanping Li","id":"37087155789"},{"name":"Kaiping Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Kaiping Xiao","id":"37087199305"},{"name":"Huali Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Huali Cui","id":"37087983310"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2405-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"1579004","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emulation","Genetic algorithms","Network topology","Switches","Delay","Logic testing","Heuristic algorithms","Local area networks","Bandwidth","Costs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579004","abstract":"For emulation-based experiments of network technologies, the network topology, which researchers require, must be mapped to the topology of network emulation testbed.

We believe that this approach provides a very attractive alternative for using RFID technology in warehouse management.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDCAT.2005.137","doi":"10.1109/PDCAT.2005.137","startPage":"895","endPage":"899","pdfPath":"/iel5/10544/33357/01579057.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579057/","displayDocTitle":"Event Driven RFID Reader for Warehouse Management","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579057/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event Driven RFID Reader for Warehouse Management","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01579057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033591S","chronDate":"05-08 Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10544","isNumber":"33357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10544","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33357","articleId":"1579057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1579064,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Guang-Min","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Institute, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wang Guang-Min","id":"37088063284"},{"name":"Wan Zhong-Ping","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wan Zhong-Ping","id":"37088065204"},{"name":"Wang Xian-Jia","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Institute, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wang Xian-Jia","id":"37087595356"},{"name":"Chen Ya-Lin","affiliation":["Systems Engineering Institute, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Chen Ya-Lin","id":"37087598601"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2405-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"1579064","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Functional programming","Parallel programming","Systems engineering and theory","Constraint optimization","Mathematical programming","Biological cells","Distributed computing","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear bilevel programming","genetic algorithm","fitness value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linear bilevel programming","genetic algorithm","fitness value"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PDCAT.2005.145","pdfPath":"/iel5/10544/33357/01579064.pdf","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)","startPage":"920","endPage":"924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDCAT.2005.145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Solving Linear Bilevel Programming","abstract":"Bilevel programming, a tool for modelling decentralized decisions, consists of the objectives of the upper level and lower level.

We elaborate the general principle behind timing anomalies and propose a general criterion (resource allocation criterion) that provides a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of timing anomalies in a processor. This principle allows to state the absence of timing anomalies for a specific combination of hardware and software and thus forms a solid theoretic foundation for the time-predictable execution of real-time software on complex processor hardware.","doi":"10.1109/QSIC.2005.49","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Quality Software (QSIC'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Quality Software (QSIC'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10545/33358/01579148.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2005.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33358","startPage":"295","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principles of timing anomalies in superscalar processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Principles of timing anomalies in superscalar processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579148/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8748446","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles of timing anomalies in superscalar processors","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"01579148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083451S","chronDate":"19-20 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10545","isNumber":"33358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10545","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33358","articleId":"1579148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":1579665,"authors":[{"name":"Shang-Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shang-Wei Wang","id":"37934921000"},{"name":"Wun-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Business Administration, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wun-Hwa Chen","id":"37066103200"},{"name":"Chorng-Shyong Ong","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chorng-Shyong Ong","id":"37528586900"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Medical Informatics, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li Liu","id":"37559758800"},{"name":"Yun-Wen Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Business Administration, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yun-Wen Chuang","id":"37959410300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2507-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1605"}],"articleNumber":"1579665","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","Hospitals","Computer aided software engineering","Medical services","Manufacturing","Costs","Health and safety","Government","Supply chain management","Health information management"]}],"abstract":"After manufacturing and retail marketing, healthcare is considered the next home for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Although in its infancy, RFID technology has great potential in healthcare to significantly reduce cost, and improve patient safety and medical services. However, the challenge will be to incorporate RFID into medical practice, especially when relevant experience is limited. To explore this issue, we conducted a case study that demonstrated RFID integration into the medical world at one Taiwan hospital. The project that was studied, the Location-based Medicare Service project, was partially subsidized by the Taiwan government and was aimed at containing SARS, a dangerous disease that struck Taiwan in 2003. Innovative and productive of several significant results, the project established an infrastructure and platform allowing for other applications. In this paper we describe the development strategy, design, and implementation of the project. We discuss our findings pertaining to the collaborative development strategy, device management, data management, and value generation. These findings have important implications for developing RFID applications in healthcare organizations.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2006.422","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10548/33368/01579665.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2006.422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33368","startPage":"184a","endPage":"184a","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFID Application in Hospitals: A Case Study on a Demonstration RFID Project in a Taiwan Hospital","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RFID Application in Hospitals: A Case Study on a Demonstration RFID Project in a Taiwan Hospital","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579665/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"8","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579665/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFID Application in Hospitals: A Case Study on a Demonstration RFID Project in a Taiwan Hospital","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01579665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073483S","chronDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10548","isNumber":"33368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10548","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"33368","articleId":"1579665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1579775,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Therefore, we provide a method of organizing a large distributed system through analysis of its sensing capabilities to efficiently communicate features of images within the sensor field. Concurrent detections of targets in a sensor field are used to analyze the field of view of image sensors. Link weights are established to provide intelligent communication behavior. Using these link weights, sensor nodes communicate to those that need target features to estimate a 3D track. They also communicate to warn sensor nodes of an approaching target. We illustrate the feasibility of this approach through simulations and deployed experiments.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2006.364","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10548/33369/01579775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2006.364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33369","startPage":"235c","endPage":"235c","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Scaling Distributed Low-Power Wireless Image Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Scaling Distributed Low-Power Wireless Image Sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579775/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579775/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Scaling Distributed Low-Power Wireless Image Sensors","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01579775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043449S","chronDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10548","isNumber":"33369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10548","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33369","articleId":"1579775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1579797,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Error correction algorithms are known to be very important for communication data rate and reliability. As reconfigurable architectures are attractive for fast prototyping and flexibility, they are often considered as support for implementation of communication, including mobile communication. Madeo is an open framework for designing physical FPGA architectures and their applications. On the basis of an abstract model for reconfigurable circuits, Madeo provides the necessary tools (logic synthesis and physical tool) to program them. The paper describes the block turbo decoder principle, discusses existing solutions and presents characteristics of a partial implementation on the open framework Madeo. Three elements of a block turbo decoder have been designed using Madeo and the physical solutions compete very well with existing solutions for such problems.","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2006.453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2006.453","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10548/33370/01579812.pdf","startPage":"250b","endPage":"250b","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case Study of Block Turbo Decoders on a Framework for Portable Synthesis on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Case Study of Block Turbo Decoders on a Framework for Portable Synthesis on FPGA","conferenceDate":"4-7 Jan. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"10","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case Study of Block Turbo Decoders on a Framework for Portable Synthesis on FPGA","confLoc":"Kauai, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"01579812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0917S","chronDate":"04-07 Jan. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"10548","isNumber":"33370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33370","articleId":"1579812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1579813,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We also propose a joint power management scheme for transmitter and receiver to save receiver energy while maintaining same communication quality by properly delivering more transmit power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy/power estimation for LDPC decoders in software radio systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579837.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Energy/power estimation for LDPC decoders in software radio systems","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579837/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8836283","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy/power estimation for LDPC decoders in software radio systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054394S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579840,"authors":[{"name":"M.O.

This algorithm combines elements from Montgomery's modular multiplication technique, carry-save and carry-delayed number representations. The major advantage of this algorithm over previously reported algorithms is that it does not require the result of each modular multiplication in the exponentiation process to be converted from the redundant representation back to a nonredundant form. In our algorithm, the conversion is only necessary at the end of all the modular multiplications. Avoiding the conversion speeds up the modular exponentiation process. In addition, the algorithm allows for a fast, modular, and scalable hardware implementation.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579840.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware design for end-to-end modular exponentiation in redundant number representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579840/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware design for end-to-end modular exponentiation in redundant number representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8836285","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579840/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware design for end-to-end modular exponentiation in redundant number representation","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076525S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1579844,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

The concept of the proposed criterion is the detection of cycles in the sequences of soft words. The soft-word cycles occur in some cases of low signal-to-noise ratios and indicate that the decoder is unable to decide on a codeword, which in turn results in unnecessary power consumption due to iterations that do not improve the bit error rate. The proposed architecture terminates the decoding process when a soft-word cycle occurs, allowing for substantial power savings at a minimal performance penalty.

CMOS image sensors are becoming popular, because various circuits can be integrated with it into a single chip. In a single chip CMOS image sensor for handheld devices which requires low power consumption, ISP has to be implemented to small size while maintaining the high performance. Demosaicking and image enhancing are the largest blocks in the ISP, because they need some line memories. In this paper, we propose a new method to minimize the number of line memory. In the proposed method, contrast enhancement is done using the buffered data for demosaicking. The green channel is used instead of luminance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach enhances the image quality without additional line memories.

The low classification of the data stored in repositories exempted from quality control justifies the need for approximate matching methods maintaining the efficiency of the retrieval and accuracy of the results. Moreover, because the average bandwidth of the main memory is crucial for system performance, development of digital VLSI (very large scale integration) architectures for low-level and very high throughput data processing has been a main issue in this work. Thus this paper presents the hardware realization of a text search engine using bit-parallelism and a fast serial processing of the database information.

Time-domain channel estimation combined with frequency domain equalization is an attractive approach, since it can provide lower complexity and better estimator performance than pure frequency domain processing. In the particular case of constant modulus (M-PSK) modulation, we show that the transmission matrix is unitary. Therefore, the simple correlator channel estimator turns out to be optimal. For the case of non-constant envelope the transmission matrix is not unitary any more, but its corresponding correlation matrix is strongly diagonal. Therefore, a low-complexity approximate LS solution is proposed which avoids matrix inversion. A study of decision-feedback errors is performed, which suggest that iterative re-decoding of the data further improves the channel estimates. Simulations carried out for a wide range of mobile speeds demonstrate that the proposed estimators, using only 2% of pilot data, outperform recently proposed [T.

Traditionally, object detection has been performed purely in software in surveillance systems. The problem of object detection, however, becomes critical in the upcoming wireless visual sensors because of size and power constraints. The need for low-power, small size, hardware implementations is greatly felt. This paper introduces a VLSI architecture for Wronskian change detector (WCD). Object detection is done through background subtraction. WCD offers regularity, low complexity and accuracy as well as global illumination changes independency. WCD can be employed in automated visual surveillance on buildings and adjacent parking lots. WCD replaces each pixel by a vector containing luminance value of the pixel and its surrounding area. A linear dependency test is applied to each vector to determine if a change has occurred. WCD is mapped into a 12-processing element array with a fixed window value of 3/spl times/3. Design of each processing element is discussed in detail. Based on extensive search, no VLSI implementation of WCD has been reported previously.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579881.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture for an object change detector for visual sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579881/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture for an object change detector for visual sensors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579881/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8846467","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture for an object change detector for visual sensors","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058377S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579915,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Therefore, new high performance reconfigurable platforms for baseband digital signal processing are required. Due to their flexibility, with low reconfiguration overhead, performance and energy efficiency, coarse grain reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) are good candidates to fulfil this need. ADRES is a CGRA that combines a VLIW processor with a reconfigurable coarse-grain array. In this paper, we analyze the mapping on ADRES of one of the most demanding wireless OFDM DSP algorithms: the space division multiplexing (SDM) receiver. The latter will probably be mandatory in the next WLAN generation (802.11n). We also compare the obtained results with a mapping onto a VLIW processor, showing a gain of 5 in performance and a factor 1.75 in power efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping a multiple antenna SDM-OFDM receiver on the ADRES coarse-grained reconfigurable processor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579915","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579915.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Mapping a multiple antenna SDM-OFDM receiver on the ADRES coarse-grained reconfigurable processor","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579915/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857695","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping a multiple antenna SDM-OFDM receiver on the ADRES coarse-grained reconfigurable processor","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059794S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1579916,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Large program codes result in large memories, which increase the size and cost of the chip. Poor code density is a problem especially in VLIW architectures, where a long instruction word is used to control the concurrently operating hardware resources. In addition, wide instructions increase the memory bandwidth, which may result in increased power consumption. Dictionary compression is one of the most often used compression methods to improve the code density due to its simplicity. In this paper, dictionary-based program compression is applied on transport triggered architecture, a customizable processor architecture that is particularly suitable for tailoring the hardware resources according to the requirements of the application.

Three different instances of the generic platform and two sets of benchmarks are used in the experiments. The analysis on five real-life applications showed that these applications spend an average of 69% of their instruction count in 11% on average of their code. The extensive experimentation illustrates that for the systems composed by 32-bit processors the speedup of five applications ranges from 1.3 to 3.7 relative to an all software solution.

If an area-efficient decoder is preferred, mapping the Viterbi algorithm onto reduced computational resources becomes attractive. This implies a need for path metric storage and an interconnection network between parallel computation units and path metric memories. In this paper, an efficient access scheme for path metric computations is presented, which reduces the interconnection complexity. The scheme supports different code rates, number of states, and parallelism of the decoder. It utilizes an in-place update method resulting in minimum path metric memory usage. Further memory savings are achieved by merging several path metrics into one memory word, which reduces the number of memory modules. The interconnections have been simplified reducing the number of connection patterns with efficient scheduling of path metric computations. With certain design parameters, a simple hardwired interconnection network is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","startPage":"503","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579920.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Maximum likelihood decoding","Concurrent computing","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Parallel processing","Convolutional codes","Computer networks","Merging","Processor scheduling","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Viterbi decoding","multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized path metric access scheme","rate Viterbi decoders","memory modules","hardwired interconnection network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection optimized path metric access scheme for k/n-rate Viterbi decoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579920/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579920/","accessionNumber":"8857700","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection optimized path metric access scheme for k/n-rate Viterbi decoders","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060989S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1579923,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-yeol Oh","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-yeol Oh","id":"37279438900"},{"name":"Myoung-seob Lim","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Information Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myoung-seob Lim","id":"37277106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9333-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"1579923","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","OFDM","Throughput","Power engineering and energy","Memory architecture","Wideband","Computational complexity","Delay","Read only memory","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","CMOS integrated circuits","radio networks","multiplying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline FFT algorithm","pipeline FFT architectures","wireless OFDM systems","CMOS","programmable complex multiplier","0.35 mum"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the modified radix-2/sup 4/ and the radix-4/sup 2/ FFT algorithms and efficient pipeline FFT architectures based on those algorithms for OFDM systems.

The target application for such a scalable transcoder is to provide successful access to the pre-encoded high quality video from mobile wireless terminals. In the scalable transcoder, besides outputting the fine granular scalability (FGS) bitstream, both size of video frames and the bit rate are reduced. And an array processing algorithm of layer interference suppression is used at the receiver which makes the system structure provide different levels of protection to different layers. Furthermore, by considering the important level of scalable bitstream, the different bitstreams can be given different level protection by the system structure and channel coding. With the proposed system, the concurrent large diversity gain characteristic of STBC and alleviating the frequency-selective fading effect of OFDM can be achieved. The simulation results suggest that the proposed schemes integrating scalable transcoding can provide a basic quality of video transmission and outperform the convention single layer transcoding transmitted under the random and bursty error channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579929.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable transcoding for video transmission over space-time OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579929/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable transcoding for video transmission over space-time OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846480","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579929/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable transcoding for video transmission over space-time OFDM systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072058S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579935,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Ik Ko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"lastName":"Dong-Ik Ko","id":"37424825500"},{"name":"S.S.

The performance and cost of these applications can change dramatically depending on the implementation methods for FIFO buffers and the data delivery methods between modules. This paper introduces a new FIFO hardware mapping algorithm based on pointer-based token delivery from dataflow semantics for image and video processing applications. This approach significantly improves the performance of dataflow based implementation of image and video processing systems, and allows effective prediction of changes in performance and buffer memory requirements associated with changes in image resolution. Our pointer-based token delivery method allows indirect token delivery between actors by pointers in conjunction with use of a shared memory. Each pointer references a data block stored in the shared memory. In pointer-based token delivery, a buffer can be configured to be implemented as the combination of a small, fast FIFO and a larger, relatively cheap shared memory while providing an attractive trade-off between performance and hardware cost. We present the complete semantics of our pointer-based modeling method, systematic techniques for mapping representations using these semantics into efficient implementations, and experimental results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed pointer-based techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579935.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and optimization of buffering trade-offs for hardware implementation of image processing applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Image processing","Application software","Costs","Field programmable gate arrays","Image resolution","Signal processing algorithms","Educational institutions","Video sharing","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","buffer storage","data flow graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","hardware implementation","buffering","image resolutions","FIFO buffers","data delivery methods","hardware mapping algorithm","pointer-based token delivery","dataflow semantics","video processing","dataflow based implementation","buffer memory","shared memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and optimization of buffering trade-offs for hardware implementation of image processing applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846486","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and optimization of buffering trade-offs for hardware implementation of image processing applications","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06007S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579940,"authors":[{"name":"M.

But, new methodologies are still needed to automatically map a DSP application into an FPGA with respect to design constraints such as area, power consumption, execution time and time-to-market. Moreover DSP applications are frequently specified using floating-point arithmetic whereas fixed-point arithmetic should be used on FPGA. In this paper, a high-level synthesis methodology under constraints is presented. The originality is to consider a computation accuracy constraint. The methodology is based on a fixed-point operator library which characterizes the operators cost according to their wordlength. An error noise propagation model is used to compute an analytical expression of the accuracy in function of the signals wordlength. To obtain an efficient hardware implementation, the data wordlength optimization process is coupled with the high-level synthesis. In addition, the accuracy evaluation is done through an analytical method, which drastically reduces the optimization time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","High level synthesis","Signal synthesis","Energy consumption","Time to market","Floating-point arithmetic","Fixed-point arithmetic","Libraries","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA synthesis","data wordlength optimization","field programmable gate arrays","digital signal processing applications","DSP applications","floating-point arithmetic","fixed-point arithmetic","high-level synthesis methodology","fixed-point operator library","error noise propagation model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579941","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579941","startPage":"623","endPage":"628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579941.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579941/","displayDocTitle":"Data wordlength optimization for FPGA synthesis","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","accessionNumber":"8857710","htmlLink":"/document/1579941/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data wordlength optimization for FPGA synthesis","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058187S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1579942,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["VTT Electronics, Oulu, Finland"],"lastName":"Yan Zhang","id":"37087281541"},{"name":"A.

Implementation complexity and goodness of curve reconstruction were both considered so that the evaluation process could be more accurate and complete.

Final image quality (IQ) depends not only on the scale factor but also on the type of image (photo, CAD, text...) the user is willing to print or display. Formally, any scaling operation can be interpreted as a combination of an anti-alias filter and an interpolation by continuous convolution. In this paper we present a hardware architecture based on this formal framework that performs two dimensional (2-D) separable image up- and down-scaling with a high degree of flexibility and a low hardware cost. In particular, in this paper we propose a convolution interpolator with a programmable kernel memory, we develop a design rule for optimizing the kernel coefficient memory size and we report a flexible anti-alias filter. The increased flexibility provided by the combination of the aforementioned elements renders superior IQ since the scaling technique and parameters can be adjusted to each specific type of image.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579953.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible hardware architecture for 2-D separable scaling using convolution interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Convolution","Interpolation","Filters","Kernel","Image quality","Two dimensional displays","Costs","Design optimization","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","interpolation","filtering theory","image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible hardware architecture","convolution interpolation","single scaling technique","image quality","antialias filter","continuous convolution interpolation","hardware architecture","2D separable image scaling","programmable kernel memory","kernel coefficient memory size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Flexible hardware architecture for 2-D separable scaling using convolution interpolation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846499","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible hardware architecture for 2-D separable scaling using convolution interpolation","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052593S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579955,"authors":[{"name":"I.A.

Recently, it has been viable for the downlink and terminal implementations. The PIC schemes using as \"infected\" signal the correlation input have a simpler structure, but perform poorly when the spreading factor (SF) is low. In this paper we propose a new PIC scheme which, besides multiple access interference (MAI) suppression to the correlation input performs also inter-path interference (IPI) mitigation to the correlation output. Numerical results for a downlink DS/CDMA system show that the proposed multistage detector optimizes jointly performance and computational power. It approximates the performance of a conventional PIC, suppressing the interference to the correlation output, but it has lower computational complexity. In the same time, the computational similarities and the iterative nature of the different sub-algorithms of the proposed PIC scheme make possible the design of a simple reconfigurable architecture which minimizes the area overhead and the power consumption. These properties are suitable for terminal implementations where the computational power is more critical than for the base stations (BSs).","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","startPage":"699","endPage":"704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel interference cancellation for DS/CDMA downlink with low spreading factors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel interference cancellation for DS/CDMA downlink with low spreading factors","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579955/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846501","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel interference cancellation for DS/CDMA downlink with low spreading factors","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048094S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1579958,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Ju Kim","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung Ju Kim","id":"37423837100"},{"name":"Jung Ho Noh","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung Ho Noh","id":"37429272900"},{"name":"Kyung Hi Chang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyung Hi Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9333-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"1579958","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"In this paper, robust timing & frequency synchronization techniques for OFDMA (OFDM-FDMA) systems is presented.

Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have a sparse parity-check matrix (H matrix). In LDPC decoder, the H matrix is stored in memory and contains information about the parity check constraints. The approach presented in this paper constructs several sub-matrices (pseudo random patterns) that are repeatedly used to form the H matrix. The merits of this approach on the decoder architecture are two-fold. First, the switch logic associated with data forwarding in and out of the memory blocks, or alternately the routing of bit nodes to check nodes is simplified. Second, this approach reduces information stored in the design about the H matrix. Thus, the hardware complexity of the decoder is significantly reduced with an added advantage of increased throughput. LDPC code performance simulation results show that the proposed approach does not compromise the bit error rate performance (BER) compared to that of ideal/optimal H matrix for same code length (N = 2040) and rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579964.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tiling parity-check matrix for reduced complexity high throughput low-density parity-check decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Throughput","Hardware","Sparse matrices","Bit error rate","Switches","Costs","Iterative decoding","Clocks","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","matrix algebra","decoding","block codes","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware complexity reduction","high throughput low-density parity-check decoders","sparse parity-check matrix","pseudorandom patterns","data forwarding","memory blocks","LDPC code performance simulation","bit error rate performance","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Tiling parity-check matrix for reduced complexity high throughput low-density parity-check decoders","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579964/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8846507","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tiling parity-check matrix for reduced complexity high throughput low-density parity-check decoders","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579964.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039301S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1579966,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In previous work, we proposed a scheduling scheme for the overlapped message passing (OMP) decoding of the SFT codes. In this paper, we first show that our scheduling scheme produces the minimum intra-iteration waiting time for QC LDPC codes. Then we propose a coset-based construction of QC LDPC codes, and study the girth and minimum distance properties of our new codes. Given the same parameters, the ensemble of the SFT codes is a subset of the ensemble of our coset-based QC LDPC codes. Our coset-based QC LDPC codes allow the OMP decoding to achieve greater throughput gain and higher HUE while maintaining the same theoretical performances as the SFT codes.","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579967.pdf","startPage":"762","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coset-based quasi-cyclic LDPC codes for optimal overlapped message passing decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579967/","displayDocTitle":"Coset-based quasi-cyclic LDPC codes for optimal overlapped message passing decoding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857719","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1579967/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coset-based quasi-cyclic LDPC codes for optimal overlapped message passing decoding","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"01579967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057979S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10549","isNumber":"33371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10549","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33371","articleId":"1579967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1579968,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chin Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Chin Liao","id":"37273576600"},{"name":"Chien-Ching Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Ching Lin","id":"37278413200"},{"name":"Chih-Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Wei Liu","id":"37280626300"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsie-Chia Chang","id":"37280773500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9333-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-3562"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-3570"}],"articleNumber":"1579968","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":104},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic normalization technique for decoding LDPC codes","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10549/33371/01579968.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems Design and Implementation, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33371","doi":"10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579968","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Iterative algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Hardware","Additive white noise","Block codes","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code decoding","dynamic normalization technique","nonlinear operation","normalization factor","error performance","min-sum algorithm","hardware implementation","complexity reductions","implementation loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579968","abstract":"In this paper, a dynamic normalization technique is proposed to approximate the nonlinear operation in decoding LDPC codes.

The finite-element in conjunction with Galerkin's method it's been applied to discretizate the transversal domain and perfect matched layers (PML's) are placed to truncate the transversal boundaries.","doi":"10.1109/IMOC.2005.1579990","publicationTitle":"SBMO/IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Microwave and Optoelectronics, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"SBMO/IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Microwave and Optoelectronics, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10491/33372/01579990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMOC.2005.1579990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33372","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new spatio-temporal 2D-FEM formulation applied to optical devices with cylindrical symmetry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1579990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new spatio-temporal 2D-FEM formulation applied to optical devices with cylindrical symmetry","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579990/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8986974","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1579990/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new spatio-temporal 2D-FEM formulation applied to optical devices with cylindrical symmetry","confLoc":"Brasilia, Brazil","sourcePdf":"01579990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052951S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10491","isNumber":"33372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10491","xplore-issue":"33372","articleId":"1579990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1579998,"authors":[{"name":"R.M. de Castro","affiliation":["Pra\u00e7a General Tib\u00farcio 80, Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME), Urca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"R.M.","lastName":"de Castro","id":"37086905764"},{"name":"M.H.C.

The merits of a number of linearly constrained adaptive algorithms are verified in an assumed far-field condition: the constrained least mean square (CLMS) algorithm, the constrained affine projection algorithm (CAPA), the constrained conjugate gradient (CCG) algorithm, and the constrained recursive least square (CRLS) algorithm. In order to have a more suitable scenario for the simulations, a fixed AOA estimation method is used and a moving target model is proposed and tested in our experiments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMOC.2005.1579998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33372","startPage":"274","endPage":"278","displayPublicationTitle":"SBMO/IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Microwave and Optoelectronics, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10491/33372/01579998.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of constrained adaptive algorithms for combined beamforming and AOA tracking of a moving target","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1579998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1579998/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of constrained adaptive algorithms for combined beamforming and AOA tracking of a moving target","conferenceDate":"25-25 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8986981","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of constrained adaptive algorithms for combined beamforming and AOA tracking of a moving target","confLoc":"Brasilia, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1579998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045049S","chronDate":"25-25 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10491","isNumber":"33372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10491","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33372","articleId":"1579998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"}]
