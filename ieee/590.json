Their overcompleteness is useful for error-resilient and high-quality coding, whereas denoising and texture analysis benefit from their shift-invariance. Although paraunitary filter banks are mainly considered in the related works, fixed-point implementation of such systems remains an open problem. In this paper, we present quaternionic lattice structure for eight-band oversampled linear-phase paraunitary filter banks (OLPPUFBs) which guarantees orthogonality of the filters regardless of the coefficient precision.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5903288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPA.2007.5903299","publicationTitle":"Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications SPA 2007","displayPublicationTitle":"Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications SPA 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871958/5903288/05903299.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","doi":"10.1109/SPA.2007.5903299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of eight-band oversampled linear phase paraunitary filter banks using quaternion multiplication matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of eight-band oversampled linear phase paraunitary filter banks using quaternion multiplication matrices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/5903299/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"12075062","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5903299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of eight-band oversampled linear phase paraunitary filter banks using quaternion multiplication matrices","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"0867spworkshop2007olppufb.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051647S","chronDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5871958","isNumber":"5903288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871958","xplore-issue":"5903288","articleId":"5903299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5903301,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Our considerations are important in postoperative treatments of this illness. The applied neural network is a three layer one with one hidden layer. Its designing and testing investigations were performed in MATLAB environment. As the network teaching method, classical error back-propagation algorithm with a momentum factor was applied. For the assumed model of the problem, we have obtained a characteristic graph of the function describing false results of the survival predictions. We have utilized a representative training set and investigated the network for different number of neurons in the hidden layer. A distinct error minimum has been observed for 13 neurons in this layer. It is not out of the question that the character of the achieved curve is repeatable for different input/output vectors and may be practicable for determining the number of neurons in networks dedicated to biological models.","doi":"10.1109/SPA.2007.5903302","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications SPA 2007","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871958/5903288/05903302.pdf","publicationTitle":"Signal Processing Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications SPA 2007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPA.2007.5903302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5903288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of hidden layer in a neural network used to predict bladder-cancer patient-survival","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Bladder","Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Microscopy","Neurons","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","biology computing","cancer","perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","bladder-cancer patient-survival prediction","perceptron network","MATLAB environment","network teaching method","error back-propagation algorithm","representative training set","biological models","momentum factor","patient survival time prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5903302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of hidden layer in a neural network used to predict bladder-cancer patient-survival","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5903302/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2011","conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"12075065","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of hidden layer in a neural network used to predict bladder-cancer patient-survival","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"1197wersjafinalna10082007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053205S","chronDate":"7-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"5871958","isNumber":"5903288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871958","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5903288","articleId":"5903302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5903304,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Seirafian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Seirafian","id":"37712084500"},{"name":"Vahid Tabataba Vakily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid Tabataba","lastName":"Vakily","id":"37299722900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1514-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1515-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-0262"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"}],"articleNumber":"5903304","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","IP networks","OFDM","Interference","Simulation","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing error analysis","timing synchronization error","OFDM symbol","cyclic prefix","DAB system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","signal to interference ratio","digital audio broadcasting"]}],"abstract":"OFDM systems are sensitive to timing synchronization errors that refers to incorrect detection of the start position of an OFDM symbol.
